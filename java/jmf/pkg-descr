The Java Media Framework API (JMF) enables audio, video and other
time-based media to be added to Java applications and applets. This
optional package, which can capture, playback, stream and transcode
multiple media formats, extends the multimedia capabilities on the
J2SE platform, and gives multimedia developers a powerful toolkit to
develop scalable, cross-platform technology.
