Apache Commons Primitives provides a collection of types and utilities
optimized for working with Java primitives (boolean, byte, char, double, float,
int, long, short). Generally, the Commons-Primitives classes are faster,
smaller and easier to work with than their purely Object based alternatives.

Currently Commons Primitives is primarily composed of implementations of the
java.util collections adapted for the primitive types.
