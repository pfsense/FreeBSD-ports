To make WildFly bind to all interfaces add this to rc.conf:

%%APP_SHORTNAME%%_args="-Djboss.bind.address=0.0.0.0"

See http://wildscribe.github.io/ for additional startup properties.

To change JVM args, edit appropriate standalone.conf.



To add the initial admin user:

%%APP_HOME%%/bin/add-user.sh



Standard output and error are redirected to %%APP_SHORTNAME%%_log_stdout and %%APP_SHORTNAME%%_log_stderr respectively. This is very handy to detect startup errors but in production could be advisible to avoid it
because by default they are never rotated, to accomplish it add this to rc.conf

%%APP_SHORTNAME%%_log_stdout="/dev/null"
%%APP_SHORTNAME%%_log_stderr="/dev/null"

Ordinary logs are located at %%APP_HOME%%/standalone/log/server.log
