JTiger is a unit test framework and tools for the Java 2 Platform. The
framework provides a useful abstraction on which to write unit test
fixtures and unit test cases. JTiger tools provide functionality
that is often desired in software unit testing environments. JTiger
development encourages Test Driven Development, though it doesn't
mandate it, and any unit testing software development technique
is sufficient.
