The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component provides an efficient, up-to-date,
and feature-rich package implementing the client side of the most recent HTTP
standards and recommendations.

Designed for extension while providing robust support for the base HTTP
protocol, the HttpClient component may be of interest to anyone building
HTTP-aware client applications such as web browsers, web service clients,
or systems that leverage or extend the HTTP protocol for distributed
communication.
