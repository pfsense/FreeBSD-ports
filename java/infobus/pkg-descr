InfoBus enables dynamic exchange of data between JavaBeans(TM) component
architecture by defining a small number of interfaces between cooperating
Beans and specifying the protocol for use of those interfaces. The
protocols are based on a notion of an information bus. All components
which implement these interfaces can plug into the bus. As a member of the
bus any component can exchange data with any other component in a
structured way, including arrays, tables, and database rowsets.
