This is jikes, a java source to byte-code compiler.  The compiler has been
made available by IBM under their open-source license, please see:

for details.  To operate, the CLASSPATH environment variable must typically
be set to a colon-delimited list of source directories, class directories,

file is specified in CLASSPATH.
