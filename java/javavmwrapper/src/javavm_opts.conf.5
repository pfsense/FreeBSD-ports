.Dt JAVAVM_OPTS.CONF 5
.Sh NAME
.Nm javavm_opts.conf
.Nd the Java VM wrapper options configuration file.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
contains variables which set options that should be passed to the
Java VM that is invoked by the Java VM wrapper.
.Pp
Which Java VM a variable provides options for is determined by the variable
name.  The Java VM wrapper currently recognises the following patterns for
variable names:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ev JAVAVM_OPTS
The options specified by this variable are passed to all Java VM
invocations.  In practise, this variable should be reserved for use
on the command line and not set in
.Nm .
.It Ev JAVAVM_OPTS_JAVA_HOME_DIR
The contents of this variable are passed as options to all java
commands invoked by javavm within the
.Pa JAVA_HOME_DIR
directory specified.
The
.Pa JAVA_HOME_DIR
specified here is the directory portion of
.Ev JAVA_HOME
with special characters replaced by an underscore.
.It Ev JAVAVM_OPTS_JAVA_PROG
The contents of this variable are passed as options to all invocations
of the specified java programme.
.It Ev JAVAVM_OPTS_JAVA_HOME_DIR_JAVA_PROG
The contents of this variable are passed as options to the invocation
of the specified java programme within the specified JAVA_HOME
directory.
This allows the options to only affect a single programme.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa %%PREFIX%%/etc/javavm_opts.conf
The location of the Java VM wrapper options configuration file.
.It Pa %%PREFIX%%/etc/javavm_opts.conf.dist
The location of the example Java VM wrapper options configuration file
distributed with the Java VM wrapper.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ev JAVAVM_OPTS_diablo_jdk1_5_0=-XX:+UseMembar
Run the Java VMs installed by the Diablo JDK in
.Pa %%PREFIX%%/diablo-jdk1.5.0
with the option
.Dq -XX:+UseMembar .
.It Ev JAVAVM_OPTS_javac=-deprecation
Run the
.Pa javac
programme with the option
.Dq -deprecation .
.It Ev JAVAVM_OPTS_diablo_jdk1_5_0_javac=-Xlint
Run the javac installed by the Diablo JDK with the option
.Dq -Xlint .
.El
.Pp
Due to stacking, if the above three variables were set, then the javac
installed by the Diablo JDK would run with the options
.Dq -XX:+UseMembar -deprecation -Xlint
(although not necessarily in that order).
