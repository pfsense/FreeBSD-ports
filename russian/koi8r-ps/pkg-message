  message: <<EOM
	This  port  tries  to patch  the  GhostScript's  Fontmap
	automaticly, so unless you have non-standard GhostScript
	installation   (or   if    you   installed   GhostScript
	afterwards), you should not have to do anything.

	For   your  X-server   to  use   the  fonts,   you  have
	to    add    the   ${PREFIX}/share/koi8r-ps    (usually,
	/usr/local/share/koi8r-ps)  to  the server's  font-path.
	Use ``xset  fp+'' to do  this for the  current X-session
	and consult  your X-server's documentation to  make this
	permanent.

	For gv  to use  the newly installed  KOI8 fonts,  it may
	have  to start  GhostScript  with the  ``-dNOPLATFONTS''
	option. One way  to ensure this is  to add -dNOPLATFONTS
	to  the   GV.gsX11Device  resource  --  either   in  the
	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/GV,  or in  individual's
	~/.Xdefaults. An individual user  can also put this into
	his or her  ~/.gv file, by starting up  gv, choosing the
	menu option  ``Ghostscript Options'' from  the ``State''
	menu and typing in ``-dNOPLATFONTS'' into the ``Device''
	entry.

	This package will NOT by  itself help you print Cyrillic
	on PostScript printers --  they use their own PostScript
	engines  (not GhostScript).  The port  russian/koify may
	help you with those.
