Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs
optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline-enabled
application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic, and self-contained
(no external dependencies).

Dear ImGui is designed to enable fast iterations and to empower programmers to
create content creation tools and visualization / debug tools (as opposed to UI
for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this
goal and lacks certain features commonly found in more high-level libraries.

Dear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in game engines (for tooling),
real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded applications, or
any applications on console platforms where operating system features are
non-standard.
