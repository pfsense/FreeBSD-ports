Pango is the text rendering engine of GNOME 2.x. SDL_Pango connects
the engine to SDL.

If you are a game software developer, you should know the difficulties
of distribution. So I will start to introduce SDL_Pango from the
viewpoint of distribution.

In Un*x, SDL_Pango is hard to use as system-independent module,
because it depends on fontconfig and Pango which are designed as
system-singleton modules. If you use SDL_Pango, your software will
require those modules installed to target system. If your software
is shipped as shrink-wrap package, it may cause much problem on
your support desk. You should carefully design your installation
process.
