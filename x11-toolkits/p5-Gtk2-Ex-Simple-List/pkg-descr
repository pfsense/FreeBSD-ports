Gtk2 has a powerful, but complex MVC (Model, View, Controller) system
used to implement list and tree widgets. Gtk2::Ex::Simple::List
automates the complex setup work and allows you to treat the list model
as a more natural list of lists structure.

After creating a new Gtk2::Ex::Simple::List object with the desired
columns you may set the list data with a simple Perl array assignment.
Rows may be added or deleted with all of the normal array operations.
You can treat the data member of the Simple::List object as an array
reference, and manipulate the list data with perl's normal array
operators.

A mechanism has also been put into place allowing columns to be Perl
scalars. The scalar is converted to text through Perl's normal
mechanisms and then displayed in the list. This same mechanism can be
expanded by defining arbitrary new column types before calling the new
function.
