ZToolkit (Ztk) is a cross-platform GUI toolkit heavily inspired by GTK.

It handles events and low level drawing on behalf of the user and provides a
high-level API for managing the UI and custom widgets.

ZToolkit is written in C based on pugl and was created to be used for various
plugins bundled with the Zrythm digital audio workstation.
