Pmw is a framework for building high-level compound widgets, or
megawidgets, constructed using other widgets as component parts. It
promotes consistent look and feel within and between graphical
applications, is highly configurable to your needs and is easy to use.

Pmw consists of:
  * A few base classes, providing a framework for building megawidgets.
  * A library of flexible and extensible megawidgets built on the base
    classes, such as ButtonBox, ComboBox, MessageDialog, etc.

The interface to Pmw megawidgets is similar to basic Tk widgets, so it
is easy for developers to include both megawidgets and basic Tk
widgets in their graphical applications. In addition, all Pmw
megawidgets may themselves be extended, using either inheritance or
composition.

The use of the Pmw framework and megawidgets replaces common widget
combinations with higher level abstractions. This simplifies code,
making it more readable and maintainable and more easily modifiable.
The ability to extend Pmw megawidgets enables developers to create new
megawidgets based on previous work.
