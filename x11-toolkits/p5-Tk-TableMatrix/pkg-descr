Tk::TableMatrix is a table/matrix widget extension to perl/tk for
displaying data in a table (or spreadsheet) format. The basic
features of the widget are:

* multi-line cells
* support for embedded windows (one per cell)
* row & column spanning
* variable width columns / height rows (interactively resizable)
* row and column titles
* multiple data sources ((perl hash|| perl callback) &| internal caching)
* supports standard Tk reliefs, fonts, colors, etc.
* x/y scrollbar support
* 'tag' styles per row, column or cell to change visual appearance
* in-cell editing - returns value back to data source
* support for disabled (read-only) tables or cells (via tags)
* multiple selection modes, with "active" cell
* multiple drawing modes to get optimal performance for larger tables
* optional 'flashes' when things update
* cell validation support
* Works everywhere Tk does (including Windows and Mac!)
