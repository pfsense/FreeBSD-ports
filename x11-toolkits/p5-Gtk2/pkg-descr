Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the Gtk+ graphical user interface library.
This module allows you to write graphical user interfaces in a perlish and
object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory management in C,
yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.  Find out more about Gtk+
at http://www.gtk.org.

The GTK+ Reference Manual is also a handy companion when writing Gtk
programs in any language.  http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/
The perl bindings follow the C API very closely, and the C reference
documentation should be considered the canonical source.
