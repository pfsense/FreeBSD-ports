Test::Tk aims to assist in the testing of Perl/Tk widgets.

createapp creates a MainWindow widget and places it in the variable $app. It
sets a timer with delay $delay to start the internal test routine.

starttesting launches the main loop and sets a timer with delay $delay to start
the internal test routine.

When testing is done the MainWindow is destroyed and the test script continues.

You can set a command line parameter show to test command on the command line.
eg perl -Mblib t/My-Test.t show. The application will not terminate so you can
visually inspect it.

It will perform two tests. You need to account for these when you set your
number of tests.

If you are not on Windows and no XServer is running, all tests will be skipped.
