Tk is a great graphical toolkit to write desktop applications. However, one can
get bothered with the constant typing of quotes and options. Tk::Sugar provides
handy subs for common options used when programming Tk.

Benefits are obvious:
- Reduced typing: The constant need to type => and '' is fine for one-off cases,
  but the instant you start using Tk it starts to get annoying.
- More compact statements: Reduces much of the redundant typing in most cases,
  which makes your life easier, and makes it take up less visual space, which
  makes it faster to read.
- No string worries: Strings are often problematic, since they aren't checked at
  compile-time. Sometimes it makes spotting an error a difficult task. Using
  this alleviates that worry.
