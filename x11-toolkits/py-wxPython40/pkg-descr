wxPython is a GUI toolkit for the Python programming language. It allows Python
programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional graphical user
interface, simply and easily. It is implemented as a Python extension module
(native code) that wraps the popular wxWidgets cross platform GUI library, which
is written in C++.
