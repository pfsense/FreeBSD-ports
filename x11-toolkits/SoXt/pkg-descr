SoXt is an open source implementation of the SGI InventorXt library,
which is a GUI binding for using Open Inventor with Xt/Motif.  While
SoXt has been developed for use with Coin, it is also possible to
compile it against Open Inventor from SGI or TGS.  A goal is to
eventually become 100% source code compatible with the InventorXt
library, which is still way off, especially when it comes to creating
derived classes.

When using SoXt, bear in mind that SoXt is in its alpha release
phase, so expect the worst...
