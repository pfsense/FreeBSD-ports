Pangolin is a lightweight portable rapid development library for managing OpenGL
display/interaction and abstracting video input. At its heart is a simple OpenGl
viewport manager which can help to modularise 3D visualisation without adding to
its complexity, and offers an advanced but intuitive 3D navigation handler.
Pangolin also provides a mechanism for manipulating program variables through
config files and ui integration, and has a flexible real-time plotter for
visualising graphical data.

The ethos of Pangolin is to reduce the boilerplate code that normally gets
written to visualise and interact with (typically image and 3D based) systems,
without compromising performance. It also enables write-once code for a number
of platforms, currently including Windows, Linux, OSX, Android and IOS.
