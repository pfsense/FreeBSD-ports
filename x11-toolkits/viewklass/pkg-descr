ViewKlass is a C++ framework for developing applications which use the
LessTif, OpenMotif or OSF/Motif[TM] user interface toolkits. In particular
it provides classes which support the creation of reusable components. This
helps to simplify the development of applications using object-oriented
techniques.

It also provides classes which encapsulate some of the more difficult and
tedious aspects of Motif development. These include classes which handle
the creation of windows, dialogs and menus.
