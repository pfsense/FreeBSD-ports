Tk::FontDialog implements a font dialog widget.

The dialog is displayed by calling the Show method. The returned value
is either the selected font (if the dialog was closed with the Ok
button) or undef (otherwise). The exact type of the return value is
either a Tk::Font object (in Tk800) or a font name string (usually
something like font1). Both can be used as values in Tk -font options.
