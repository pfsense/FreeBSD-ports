Known issues:
- On FreeBSD 11.* kernel needs to be rebuilt with EVDEV_SUPPORT
- On FreeBSD 11.* drm-kmod needs https://github.com/FreeBSDDesktop/kms-drm/pull/213

When built with LIBSEAT enabled you may see the following:

    [ERROR] [libseat] [libseat/libseat.c:73] libseat_open_seat: No backend was able to open a seat
    [ERROR] [backend/session/libseat.c:102] Unable to create seat: Function not implemented

Possible solutions (select one):
- Ignore libseat errors to let wlroots use direct session
- Start seatd (e.g., `service seatd onestart`) and optionally
  prevent compositor from using SUID (e.g., `chmod u-s $(which sway)`)
- Rebuild sysutils/seatd with SUID enabled
