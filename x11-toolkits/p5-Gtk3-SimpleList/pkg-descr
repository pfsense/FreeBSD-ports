Gtk3 has a powerful, but complex MVC (Model, View, Controller) system used to
implement list and tree widgets. Gtk3::SimpleList automates the complex setup
work and allows you to treat the list model as a more natural list of lists
structure.

After creating a new Gtk3::SimpleList object with the desired columns you may
set the list data with a simple Perl array assignment. Rows may be added or
deleted with all of the normal array operations. You can treat the data member
of the list simplelist object as an array reference, and manipulate the list
data with perl's normal array operators.
