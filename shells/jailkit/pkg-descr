Jailkit is a set of utilities to limit user accounts to specific files
using chroot() and or specific commands. Setting up a chroot shell, a
shell limited to some specific command, or a daemon inside a chroot jail
is a lot easier and can be automated using these utilities.

Jailkit is a specialized tool that is developed with a focus on security.
It will abort in a secure way if the configuration, the system setup or the
environment is not 100% secure, and it will send useful log messages that
explain what is wrong to syslog.

Jailkit is known to be used in network security appliances from several leading
IT security firms, internet servers from several large enterprise organizations,
internet servers from internet service providers, as well as many smaller
companies and private users that need to secure cvs, sftp, shell or daemon
processes.
