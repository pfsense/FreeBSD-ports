viewglob is an utility designed to complement the Unix shell in
graphical environments. It has two parts:

  1. A tool that sits as a layer between the shell and X terminal,
     keeping track of the user's current directory and command line.
  2. A graphical display which shows the layouts of directories
     referenced on the command line (including pwd).

The display reveals the results of file globs and expansions as they
are typed (hence the name), highlighting selected files and potential
name completions.

It can also be used as a surrogate terminal, where keystrokes typed in
the display are passed to the shell. Files and directories can be
double-clicked to insert their names and/or paths into the terminal.
