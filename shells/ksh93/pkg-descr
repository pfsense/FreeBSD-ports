ksh93u+ is the 2012-08-01 (stable) version of the KornShell Language
described in "The KornShell Command and Programming Language," by
Morris Bolsky and David Korn of AT&T Bell Laboratories.  The KornShell
is a shell programming language, which is upward compatible with "sh"
(the Bourne Shell), and is intended to conform to the IEEE P1003.2/ISO
9945.2 Shell and Utilities standard.  ksh93u+ provides an enhanced
programming environment in addition to the major command-entry
features of the BSD shell "csh".  With ksh93u+, medium-sized programming
tasks can be performed at shell-level without a significant loss
in performance.  In addition, "sh" scripts can be run on ksh93u+
without modification.
