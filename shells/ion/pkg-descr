Ion is a modern system shell that features a simple, yet powerful,
syntax.  It is written entirely in Rust, which greatly increases
the overall quality and security of the shell, eliminating the
possibilities of a ShellShock-like vulnerability, and making
development easier.  It also offers a level of performance that
exceeds that of Dash, when taking advantage of Ion's features.
While it is developed alongside, and primarily for, RedoxOS, it is
a fully capable on other *nix platforms.
