The Schily Bourne Shell was derived from the Bourne Shell sources from
OpenSolaris.  The Schily Bourne Shell is actively maintained and
enhanced on a regular base.  It can be compiled into three variants:

Non-POSIX SVr4/OpenSolaris variant (obosh)
	The portable but not extended variant obosh allows script
	portability testing.  Most scripts that run in the old Schily
	Bourne Shell will run with any Unix shell that is still in use
	since 1990.

Minimal POSIX compliant variant (pbosh)
	This version implements the minimal set of POSIX features and
	this version is always in strict POSIX mode.  The features are
	similar to the features in dash, but since pbosh supports multi
	byte characters, it is really POSIX compliant.  The pbosh
	variant allows script portability testing aginst the POSIX
	feature set.

The POSIX compliant extended variant (bosh)
	This version has been verified to work as the system shell on
	Gentoo Linux and OpenSolaris (SchilliX).  The enhanced Schily
	Bourne Shell (bosh) implements many features that are missing
	in the OpenSolaris Bourne Shell listed above.
