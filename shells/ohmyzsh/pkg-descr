Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your zsh
configuration.

It provides plugins for things like ansible, bazel, git, tmux, etc. It is fully
customizable and provides dozens of different themes.

Sounds boring. Let's try again.

Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one.
