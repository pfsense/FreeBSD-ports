Murex is a shell, like bash / zsh / fish / etc however Murex
supports improved features and an enhanced UX.

A non-exhaustive list features would include:

* Support for additional type information in pipelines, which can
  be used for complex data formats like JSON or tables. Meaning
  all of your existing UNIX tools to work more intelligently and
  without any additional configuration.

* Usability improvements such as in-line spell checking, context
  sensitive hint text that details a commands behavior before you
  hit return, and auto-parsing man pages for auto-completions on
  commands that don't have auto-completions already defined.

* Smarter handling of errors and debugging tools. For example
  try/catch blocks, line numbers included in error messages,
  STDOUT highlighted in red and script testing and debugging
  frameworks baked into the language itself.
