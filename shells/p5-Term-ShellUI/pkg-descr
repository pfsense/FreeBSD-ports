Term::ShellUI uses the history and autocompletion features of Term::ReadLine
to present a sophisticated command-line interface to the user.  It tries to
make every feature that one would expect to see in a fully interactive shell
trivial to implement.

You simply declare your command set and let ShellUI take
care of the heavy lifting.
