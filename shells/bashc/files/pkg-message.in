By default, Bash Commander behaves exactly like traditional bash, so it's safe
to install it as a system-wide /bin/sh. File panels are enabled only in
interactive mode, when an environment variable COMMANDER is set.
It is recommended to add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc script:

declare -x EDITOR="le"
declare -x VIEWER="le --read-only"
. /usr/local/etc/bash_commander
