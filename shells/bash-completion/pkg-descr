This is a programmable completion convenience library for the Bash shell. It
features the ability to tab-complete arguments for many common programs.

Completion functions for FreeBSD-specific software are developed independently
as an extension to the official bash-completion library. The development takes
place on GitHub: https://github.com/0mp/bash-completion-freebsd
