Wcd is a command-line program to change directory fast. It saves time typing
at the keyboard. One needs to type only a part of a directory name and wcd
will jump to it. Wcd has a fast selection method in case of multiple matches
and allows aliasing and banning of directories. Wcd also includes a full
screen interactive directory tree browser with speed search.
