sawfish.wm.ext.pager is a C/Lisp extension that provides a functional
desktop pager for the Sawfish window manager.

A pager is a map of your desktop.  As maps go, it shows not only the
visible part (your current viewport), but if you are so configured,
also the parts that extend beyond the sides of your screen.  Also, if
you have more than one workspace, the pager will follow you to where
you are, or optionally show all workspaces at once.  Of course you can
select viewports and windows, and also move or raise/lower the latter.
