This is a small application (using GTK+) which lets you select your window
manager. It looks for a file named .selectwmrc in the user's directory
which contains a list of window managers.

When you start X it should show a list which lets you choose your window
manager (by double clicking on it with the mouse or with the arrow keys
and the return or space key).
