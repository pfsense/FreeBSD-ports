The session manager may be run from XDM by setting the DisplayManager*session
X resource in xdm-config to xmsession, or by execing xmsm from ~/.Xprofile.
Just make sure to test whether it works by running 'xinit xmsession' before
doing any of the above. Note that 'xmsession' is just a shell script that sets
up the environment for xmsm, and is not needed when this has been done already.

-

xmsm is installed suid root, this is required for screen locking and running
sbin commands. Privileges are dropped at startup and are reacquired only when
necessary.
