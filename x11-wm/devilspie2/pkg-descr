Devilspie2 is a window-matching utility, allowing the user to perform
scripted actions on windows as they are created. For example, you can
script a terminal program to always be positioned at a specific screen
position, or position a window on a specific workspace.

Devilspie2 is based on the program Devilspie by Ross Burton. The
difference is that Devilspie2 has replaced the symbolic expressions of
the original with a Lua interpreter, making it much easier to maintain
and extend.

Please note that the rules of Devilspie2 are not compatible with the
symbolic expressions of the original Devilspie.
