Durden is a desktop environment for the Arcan Display Server. It
serves both as a reference showcase on how to take advantage of some
of the features in Arcan, and as a very competent entry to the
advanced-user side of the desktop environment spectrum. The basic
premise is to absorb most, if not all, features from current desktop
environments in a modular and configurable way - then let user
selected profiles actually cherry- pick the configuration, visuals and
tunning that reflects the desktop the user wants or is familiar
with. Internally, it is based around a file-system like structure
("the menu") and everything else is references to paths within this
structure.
