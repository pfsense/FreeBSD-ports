WMII is a small, dynamic window manager for X11.  It supports both classic
and tiling (acme-like) window management with extended keyboard, mouse, and
9p filesystem based remote control.  It replaces the workspace paradigm with
a new tagging approach and is highly scriptable (with plain shell or Python
and even Chicken).

Its minimalist philosophy attempts to not exceed 10.000 lines of code
(including all shipped utilities and libraries), to enforce simplicity and
clarity (read: it is hackable and beautiful).
