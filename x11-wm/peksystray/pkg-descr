Peksystray is a small system tray (also called notification tray) designed
for all lightweight window managers that support docking.  As more and more
applications use a small icon in the system tray to provide some additional
functionality and information, it becomes useful for everyone to have common
access to them.  While "heavy" window managers (Gnome, KDE...) come with a
system tray embedded in the rest of the desktop, lighter window managers
(Window Maker, Fluxbox ...) do not have this feature.  Peksystray is a very
simple and light implementation of a system tray for any window manager
supporting docking, conforming to the System Tray freedesktop.org standard.

Peksystray provides a window where icons will automatically add up depending
on the requests from the applications.  Both the size of the window and the
size of the icons can be selected by the user.  If the window is full, it
can automatically display another window in order to display more icons.

Peksystray has been named after PekWM.
