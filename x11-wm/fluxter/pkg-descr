fluxter is a newer incarnation of bbpager, which is like the name suggests a
pager tool for Blackbox.
The major changes to bbpager are:
- Accesses fluxbox configuration files, e.g. in ~/.fluxbox, rather than in
  blackbox directories.
- Default styles come from the fluxbox configuration.  Without
  customization it will track the look of the current theme.
- The configuration files have been renamed to fluxter.bb (used in a
  fluxbox environment) and fluxter.nobb (used in a non-fluxbox
  environment).  These files should go in fluxbox configuration
  directories, such as ~/.fluxbox.
- The X resource entries in the configuration files use fluxter as a label,
  rather than bbpager.
- Per-workspace wallpaper changing is supported by the addition of
  per-workspace rootCommand configuration entries.  For example:
    fluxter.workspace0.rootCommand: Esetroot /usr/share/pixmaps/bg1.png
    fluxter.workspace1.rootCommand: Esetroot /usr/share/pixmaps/bg2.png
    fluxter.workspace2.rootCommand: Esetroot /usr/share/pixmaps/bg3.png
