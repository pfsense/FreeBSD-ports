LXQt 2 desktop was installed

1) LXQt does not provide its own window manager but any arbitrary window
   manager can be used, most notably x11-wm/openbox (installed by default),
   x11-wm/plasma6-kwin (the window manager of KDE), and x11-wm/xfce4-wm (the
   window manager of Xfce). Look at the following url for some tips about how
   configure these window manager:

   https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/wiki/ConfigWindowManagers

2) If you want to test wayland support, take a look at the following url:

   https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/wiki/ConfigWaylandSettings

3) Enjoy it ;)
