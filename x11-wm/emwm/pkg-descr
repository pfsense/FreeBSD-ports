EMWM is a fork of the Motif Window Manager with fixes and enhancements. It
provides compatibility with current xorg extensions and applications, without
changing the way the window manager looks and behaves. This includes support for
multi-monitor setups trough Xinerama/Xrandr, UFT-8 support with Xft fonts, and
overall better compatibility with software that requires Extended Window Manager
Hints.
