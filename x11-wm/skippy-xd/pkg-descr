Skippy-XD is a version of Skippy that uses Xserver's XDamage, XComposite and
XFixes extensions to provide you with 'live' versions of the windows.

Skippy-XD is best described as a full-screen task-switcher for X11. It tries to
provide an alternative when taskbars or regular task-switchers aren't the most
efficient way of switching tasks (like when you have a lot of applications open)
When activated (currently only through a hotkey), it will arrange and scale
snapshots of all windows on the current desktop and it'll let you pick a
window using a mouse or a keyboard. Yes, this is also what expocity and Apple's
Expose.
