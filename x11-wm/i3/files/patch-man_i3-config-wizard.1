 The advantage of using keysyms is that the config file is easy to read, understand and modify\&. However, if we shipped with a keysym based default config file, the key positions would not be consistent across different keyboard layouts (take for example the homerow for movement)\&. Therefore, we ship with a keycode based default config and let the wizard transform it according to your current keyboard layout\&.
