  message: <<EOM
NsCDE runs a setup script when started the first time. To
ensure the best experience, it is recommended to install
a few additional ports, i.e.:

  * audio/pavucontrol - for audio/volume control
  * www/firefox - or any other browser to access help
  * x11/xcalc - as destination for a pre-set up calculator link
  * editors/nedit - as text editor
  * x11/arandr - for multi screen configuration
  * x11/xscreensaver - as lock screen
  * x11-fm/pcmanfm - as file manager

While NsCDE will generally run fine without those ports,
there will be keyboard shortcuts and links in your initial
setup, which will not work without them or without further
configuration work on your end.

NsCDE comes with a default xsessions configuration that is
managed by and integrated with fvwm; for further details on 
how to integrate NsCDE xsessions with other session managers, 
refer to the examples in %%EXAMPLESDIR%%.

{ type: upgrade
  maximum_version: 2.2
  message: <<EOM
NsCDE changed its installation layout when switching between
versions 1.x and 2.x.

Point your X start scripts to %%PREFIX%%/bin/nscde instead of
previously %%PREFIX%%/sbin/NsCDE.

For backward compatibility of your local 1.x configuration
files, it is recommended to create a symbolic link from the
old nscde shared folder to the new one:

ln -s %%PREFIX%%/share/NsCDE %%PREFIX%%/share/nscde
 
Also, default key bindings were changed. To restore original 1.x
key bindings, use the keyboard settings app or alternatively
add the following configuration to your
~/.NsCDE/Keybindings.fvwmlocal file:

  # restore nscde 1.4 key bindings
  Silent Key F4 A 1 Resize
  Silent Key F5 A 1 Move
  Silent Key F6 A 1 RaiseLower

Last but not least, it's recommended to check whether any old 1.x
installation files remain after upgrading to 2.x because it may
cause unexpected behavior. For example, remove the legacy directory
%%PREFIX%%/lib/nscde.
