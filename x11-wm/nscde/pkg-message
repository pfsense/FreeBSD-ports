NsCDE runs a setup script when started the first time. To
ensure the best experience, it is recommended to install
a few additional ports, i.e.:

  * audio/pavucontrol - for audio/volume control
  * www/firefox - or any other browser to access help
  * x11/xcalc - as destination for a pre-set up caclulator link
  * editors/nedit - as text editor
  * x11/arandr - for multi screen configuration
  * x11/xscreensaver - as lock screen
  * x11-fm/pcmanfm - as file manager

While NsCDE will generally run fine without those ports,
there will be keyboard shortcuts and links in your initial
setup, which will not work without them or without further
configuration work on your end.
