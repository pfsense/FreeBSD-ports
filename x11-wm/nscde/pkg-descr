NsCDE is a retro but powerful UNIX desktop environment which resembles CDE look
(and partially feel) but with a more powerful and flexible framework beneath-
the-surface, more suited for 21st century unix-like and Linux systems and user
requirements than original CDE.

NsCDE can be considered as a heavyweight FVWM theme on steroids, but combined
with a couple other free software components and custom FVWM applications and a
lot of configuration, NsCDE can be considered a lightweight hybrid desktop
environment.
