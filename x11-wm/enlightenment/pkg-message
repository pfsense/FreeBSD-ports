If you are experiencing strange bugs after upgrading Enlightenment, try to reset
the E's configuration. To do this, rename the ~/.e directory to something like
~/.e.old and then restart Enlightenment. The configuration wizard will be
started, and the new config would be generated. The old configuration can be
restored (if needed) by overwriting the ~/.e directory with the old one.
