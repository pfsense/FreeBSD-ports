bbkeys is the keygrabber for the Blackbox window manager: bbkeys handles all
keybindings and keyboard shortcuts for Blackbox.  It uses Blackbox' Image
classes for rendering its look and feel so that bbkeys will render itself to
match whatever Blackbox style is used.  It is highly configurable either via
the "bbconf" GUI utility or by hand-editting bbkeys's config file.
