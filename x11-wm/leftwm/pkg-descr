LeftWM is a tiling window manager written in Rust that aims to be stable
and performant. LeftWM is designed to do one thing and to do that one thing
well: be a window manager. LeftWM therefore follows the following mantra:

- LeftWM is not a compositor.
- LeftWM is not a lock screen.
- LeftWM is not a bar. But, there are lots of good bars out there. With
         themes, picking one is as simple as setting a symlink.
