Blackbox is the fast, lightweight window manager for the X Window System you
have been looking for, without all those annoying dependencies.  It is built
with C++ and contains completely original code (even though the graphics
implementation is similar to that of Window Maker).

Blackbox is written to the NetWM specification, which allows integration with
modern desktop managers including KDE and Gnome.

The port also provides root window changing tools, bsetroot and bsetbg, that
can be installed alone, without the window manager and accompanying files.
