dwm is a minimalistic window manager. It manages windows in tiling and floating
modes, much like ion, larswm and wmii. dwm however is much smaller, faster and
simpler.

It consists of a single binary, configuration is done at compile-time by a
single config.h file. dwm reads from standard input to print arbitrary status
text such as the date and/or system load.
