IceWM is a window manager for the X Window System.  The goal of IceWM
is speed, simplicity, and not getting in the user's way.  It comes with
a taskbar with pager, global and per-window keybindings, a dynamic menu
system, a simple session manager, and a system tray.  It is standards
compliant, very configurable, themeable, and well documented.
