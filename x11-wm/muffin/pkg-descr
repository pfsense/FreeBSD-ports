Muffin is a minimal X window manager aimed at nontechnical users and is
designed  to  integrate well with the GNOME desktop.  Muffin lacks some
features that may be expected by traditional UNIX  or  other  technical
users;  these users may want to investigate other available window man-
agers for use with GNOME or standalone.

Based on Mutter 3.2.1
