Labwc stands for Lab Wayland Compositor, with lab indicating a sense
of experimentation and treading new ground.

It is a wlroots-based stacking compositor aiming to be light-weight
and independent, with a focus on simply stacking windows well and
rendering some window decorations. It relies on clients for
wall-paper, panels, screenshots, and so on to create a full desktop
environment.

Labwc tries to stay in keeping with wlroots and sway in terms of
general approach and coding style.

In order to avoid re-inventing configuration & theme syntax,
openbox-3.4 specification is used. This does not mean that labwc is an
openbox clone but rather that configuration files will look and feel
familiar.
