xdgmenumaker is a command line tool, written in Python, that generates
application menus using XDG information, by scanning *.desktop files in
all $XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications directories.  Applications are sorted
according to the main categories as specified by freedesktop.org.

Menu entries that are generated by xdgmenumaker are localized according
to the running user's locale settings.
