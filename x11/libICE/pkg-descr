This package provides the X11 Inter-Client Exchange library, which
allows for communication of data between X clients.

There are numerous possible inter-client protocols, with many
similarities and common needs - authentication, version negotiation,
byte order negotiation, and so on. The Inter-Client Exchange (ICE)
protocol is intended to provide a framework for building such
protocols, allowing them to make use of common negotiation mechanisms
and to be multiplexed over a single transport connection.
