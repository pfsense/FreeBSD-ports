Virgil is a research project to investigate the possibility of creating a
virtual 3D GPU for use inside qemu virtual machines, that allows the guest
operating system to use the capabilities of the host GPU to accelerate 3D
rendering. The plan is to have a guest GPU that is fully independent of the
host GPU.
