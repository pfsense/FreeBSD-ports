LavaLauncher serves a single purpose: Letting the user execute shell
commands by clicking on icons on a dynamically sized bar, placed at
one of the screen edges.

Unlike most popular launchers, LavaLauncher does not care about
.desktop files or icon themes and it does not track open applications;
It is not a dock. To create a button, you simply provide the path to
an image and a shell command. This makes LavaLauncher considerably
more flexible: You could have buttons not just for launching
applications, but also for ejecting your optical drive, rotating your
screen, sending your cat an email, playing a funny sound, muting all
audio, toggling your lamps, etc. You can turn practically anything you
could do in your shell into a button.
