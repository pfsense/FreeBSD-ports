The xclipboard program is used to collect and display text selections
that are sent to the CLIPBOARD by other clients. It is typically used
to save CLIPBOARD selections for later use. It stores each CLIPBOARD
selection as a separate string, each of which can be selected. Each
time CLIPBOARD is asserted by another application, xclipboard transfers
the contents of that selection to a new buffer and displays it in the
text window. Buffers are never automatically deleted, so you'll want to
use the delete button to get rid of useless items.
