BBDock is an application launcher for Blackbox-like window managers that
allows one to create application buttons in the slit/dock.  It works with
PNG files rather than XPM images, and supports alpha blending at 16, 24,
and 32 bits color-depth.  Also, the raise-window function is available to
window managers which implement the EWMH specification.
