This package contains a library for the Authorization Protocol for X11.
This is useful for restricting client access to the display.

libXau provides mechanisms for individual access to an X Window System
display. It uses existing core protocol and library hooks for specifying
authorization data in the connection setup block to restrict use of the
display to only those clients that show that they know a server-specific
key called a "magic cookie".
