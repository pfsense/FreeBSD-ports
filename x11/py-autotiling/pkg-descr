This script uses the i3ipc-python library to switch the layout
splith/splitv depending on the currently focused window dimensions.
It works on both sway and i3 window managers.

The script does one thing: it checks the window height / width ratio,
and executes the equivalent of either swaymsg splitv or swaymsg splith.
Nothing less, nothing more.  Yes, it may make stacking and tabbed
layouts behave oddly.  No, nothing can be done about it.  If you like
stacking/tabbed layouts, you may use them on workspaces with autotiling
turned off (--workspaces argument).  Do not submit issues about it.

For instance, you may configure autotiling to work on odd workspaces,
but not on even:

### Autostart
  exec autotiling -w 1 3 5 7 9
