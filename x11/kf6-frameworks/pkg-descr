The KDE Frameworks are add-on libraries for coding applications with Qt.

The individual Frameworks are well documented, tested and their API style will
be familiar to Qt developers.

Frameworks are developed under the proven KDE governance model with a
predictable release schedule, a clear and vendor neutral contributor process,
open governance and flexible LGPL or MIT licensing.

The frameworks are cross-platform and function on Windows, Mac, Android and
Linux.
