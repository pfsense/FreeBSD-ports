Disman is a display management service and library.

The service can communicate with the X11 windowing system and a
multitude of Wayland compositors. The library provides convenient
objects and methods for writing frontend GUI applications that
interact with the service.

Additionally the command line utility "dismanctl" is provided to query
and modify display settings directly from the command line.
