OpenSource CPAP Analysis Reporter

OSCAR is a derivative of SleepyHead version 1.1.0, created when that
was abandoned by Mark Watkins.

SleepyHead was a cross platform, opensource sleep tracking program for
reviewing CPAP and Oximetry data, which are devices used in the
treatment of Sleep Disorders like Obstructive Sleep Apnea.
