This package contains viewres, a graphical class browser that displays
a tree showing the widget class hierarchy of the Athena Widget Set.

Each node in the tree can be expanded to show the resources that the
corresponding class adds (i.e. does not inherit from its parent) when a
widget is created. This application allows the user to visually examine
the structure and inherited resources for the Athena Widget Set.
