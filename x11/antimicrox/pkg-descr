AntiMicroX is a graphical program used to map gamepad keys to keyboard, mouse,
scripts and macros. You can use this program to control any desktop application
with a gamepad on Linux, Windows and FreeBSD. It can be also used for generating
SDL2 configuration (useful for mapping atypical gamepads to generic ones like
xbox360).
