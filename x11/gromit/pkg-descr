Gromit (GRaphics Over MIscellaneous Things) is a small tool to make
annotations on the screen.

When making presentations of the Gimp I found myself often moving the
mousepointer around the point of interest until hopefully everybody
noticed it. This annoyed me, since it is a very vague way to highlight
something. I dreamt of a small programm which allows me to simply draw
on the screen, ignoring any window-borders.
