Xvidtune is a client interface to the X server video mode extension
(XFree86-VidModeExtension). It can show current video mode, switch the
video mode and interactively adjust current video mode.

When given one of the non-toolkit options, xvidtune provides a command
line interface to either print or switch the video mode.

Without any options (or with only toolkit options) it presents the user
with various buttons and sliders that can be used to interactively
adjust existing video modes. It will also print the settings in a
format suitable for inclusion in an xorg.conf file.
