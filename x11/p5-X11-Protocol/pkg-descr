X11::Protocol is a perl module that provides an interface that is
roughly equivalent to Xlib.  Its low-level approach is intentional
as the author is working on a higher-level interface that will be
more object-oriented and easier to use, so as to allow this low
level access to eventually be replaced by an XS interface to Xlib.
