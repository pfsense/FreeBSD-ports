i3lock improves slock by making it fork() and therefore combinable with
commands to suspend your computer. Additionally, instead of turning off
your screen via DPMS and/or displaying a black screen, i3lock displays a
white screen so you can see if your computer failed to resume from suspend
or if your screen is just locked. Also, when entering a wrong password,
i3lock does not call XBell(). This is important because i3lock/slock think
you have entered a password when resuming from suspend, at least sometimes.

i3lock was forked from slock-0.9
