wmblob is a pretty much useless program, that shows moving blobs. It's
a nice dockapp for Window Maker (www.windowmaker.org), and it may well
run with other window mangers.

How to use it:

  Just start it. There are no command line options. You can change the
  colors with the three mouse buttons:

    - Left button: changes the inner color of the blobs.
    - Middle button: changes the border color of the blobs.
    - Right button: changes the background color.

  There are 16 colors available. But not every combination looks good.
