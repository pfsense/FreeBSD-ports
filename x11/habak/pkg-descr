habak is a background changing app.

habak uses layered model. Lowermost layer is just black screen. You
can put other objects on it and these objects are called habaks.
There are three kinds of habaks: graphic files (images), texts and
"internal objects". Final background image consists of one or more
habaks positioned on the black screen. The order of habaks in the
command line is also the order of displaying them on screen. So
last habak would be drawn on the top of previous.
