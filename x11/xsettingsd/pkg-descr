xsettingsd is a daemon that implements the XSETTINGS specification.

It is intended to be small, fast, and minimally dependent on other
libraries.  It can serve as an alternative to gnome-settings-daemon
for users who are not using the GNOME desktop environment but who
still run GTK+ applications and want to configure things such as
themes, font antialiasing/hinting, and UI sound effects.
