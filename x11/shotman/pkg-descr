The uncompromising screenshot GUI for Wayland compositors.

shotman takes a screenshot and shows it in a small floating thumbnail window.
The screenshot can then copied with Ctrl+C, deleted with D, or dismissed
with Esc.

shotman is designed to run in response to some global hotkey (e.g.: Super+P,
PrintScreen, etc). It is designed for interactive usage.
