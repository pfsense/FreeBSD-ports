wl-kbptr -- short for Wayland Keyboard Pointer -- is a utility to help
move the mouse pointer with the keyboard.

It works in two phases: the screen is first in mapped with three
letter labels and then the selected area is refined by bisecting
it. At any point the cursor can be moved at the location marked by the
red marker by pressing Enter or Space. A left, right and middle click
can be made by pressing the g, h and b keys respectively.

Note, your compositor needs to support the wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1
and wlr-virtual-pointer-unstable-v1 protocols.
