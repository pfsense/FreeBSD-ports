Thanks to Nikos Ntarmos, it is now possible to start slim from /etc/ttys.
Please see %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/slim for instructions on how to do that.

Alternatively, just put the following entry in /etc/rc.conf:

slim_enable=yes

*** Option "sessions" is no longer supported. ***

Now you need to put session files in the directory specified by option
"sessiondir". They should be xdg-style .desktop files.

WARNING: the default behaviour in parsing .xinitrc file has changed!
         You can now set a default xsession as described here:
         https://github.com/iwamatsu/slim/pull/1
         You can turn back to random xsession selection by compiling
         this port without the option XDEFAULT.
