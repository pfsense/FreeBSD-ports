A dynamic output configuration tool that automatically detects and configures
connected outputs based on a set of profiles.

Each profile specifies a set of outputs with additional parameters (e.g., mode).
A profile will be applied automatically if all specified outputs and modes can
be perfectly matched to the currently connected outputs and their capabilities.

This is a Wayland equivalent for tools like autorandr.
It aims to fully replace kanshi and add new features.
shikane works with Wayland compositors supporting version 3 of the
wlr-output-management protocol (e.g., compositors using wlroots v0.16).
