The bgs program allows you to tailor the appearance of the background
("root") window on a workstation display running X.
bgs uses imlib2 for image rendering and rotates the images automatically.
It is made for dynamic Xinerama/Xrandr setups such as used with notebooks,
but it works very fine in any setup.
