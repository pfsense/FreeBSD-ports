Trayer is a small program designed to provide system tray functionality that
commonly found in GNOME/KDE desktop environments, for window managers which
lack this feature.  It is similar to other applications such as `peksystray'
and `docker'.

Trayer code was extracted from fbpanel, lightweight X11 desktop panel (port
`x11/fbpanel' also available).  You can find more about it on its homepage.
