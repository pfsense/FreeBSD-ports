Xscope sits in-between an X11 client and an X11 server and prints
the contents of each request, reply, error, or event that is
communicated between them. Xscope can decode the core X11 protocol
and several extensions, including BIG-REQUESTS, LBX, MIT-SHM,
NCD-WinCenterPro, RANDR, and RENDER. This information can be useful
in debugging and performance tuning of X11 servers and clients.
