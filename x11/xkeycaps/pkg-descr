xkeycaps is a graphical front-end to xmodmap.  It opens a window that looks
like a keyboard; moving the mouse over a key shows what KeySyms and Modifier
bits that key generates.  Clicking on a key simulates KeyPress/KeyRelease
events on the window of your choice.  It is possible to change the KeySyms
and Modifiers generated by a key through a mouse-based interface.  This
program can also write an input file for xmodmap to recreate your changes
in future sessions.
