By design, X11 applications canâ€™t access window or screen contents for wayland
clients. This is fine in principle, but it breaks screen sharing in tools like
Discord, MS Teams, Skype, etc and more.

This tool allows us to share specific windows to X11 clients, but within the
control of the user at all times.
