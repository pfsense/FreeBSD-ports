Eagle Mode is an advanced solution for a futuristic style of
man-machine communication, in which the user can visit almost
everything simply by zooming in. It has a professional file manager,
file viewers and players for most of the common file types, a chess
game, a 3D mines game, a multi-function clock and some fractal fun,
all integrated in a virtual cosmos. By featuring a separate
popup-zoomed control view, help texts in the things they are
describing, editable bookmarks, multiple input methods, fast
anti-aliased graphics, a virtually unlimited depth of panel tree,
and by its portable C++ API, Eagle Mode aims to be a cutting edge
of zoomable user interfaces.
