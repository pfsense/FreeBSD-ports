dmenu-wayland is a minimalistic Wayland menu. It reads a newline separated list
of items from stdin and shows them as a menu on the top of the screen.
When the user selects one item or types any text and presses Enter, their choice
is printed to stdout.

dmenu-wayland is inspired by https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu
