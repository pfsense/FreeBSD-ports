dmenu is a minimalistic X11 menu. It reads a newline separated list of items
from stdin and shows them as a menu on the top of the screen. When the user
selects one item or types any text and presses Enter, their choice is printed
to stdout.

dmenu was developed as an addition to the dynamic window manager (dwm), but can
be used in any X11-environment.
