Clipcat is a clipboard manager written in Rust Programming Language.

Clipcat uses the Client-Server architecture. There are two role types in this
architecture: `Server` and `Client`.

A `clipcat` server (as known as daemon) is running as the background process
and does the following routines:
- Watching the changes of `X11 clipboard`.
- Caching the content of `X11 clipboard`.
- Inserting content into `X11 clipboard`.
- Serving as a `gRPC` server and waiting for remote procedure call from clients.

A `clipcat` client sends requests to the server for the following operations:
- List: list the cached clips from server.
- Insert: replace the current content of `X11 clipboard` with a clip.
- Remove: remove the cached clips from server.
