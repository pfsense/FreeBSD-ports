Gnome-shell requires acceleration of to work. For this a nvidia card
with the nvidia-driver, or a Intel/ATI KMS enabled card is needed.

For the nvidia users no other changes are needed. For Intel/ATI KMS
driver the user needs to have read/write permissions on
/dev/dri/cardN (usually N=0). If gnome-shell is launched from gdm, the
gdm user also needs this access.

Access can be granted by adding the user(s) to the video group.
  pw groupmod video -m jerry

In order to launch your session. Copy 'xprofile' into your home directory:
  cp %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/xprofile ~/.xprofile

Create or edit /var/db/AccountsService/users/YOURLOGIN file:
  [User]
  Language=fr_FR.UTF-8 # e.g. for French users
  Session=gnome-xorg
  SystemAccount=false

Replace YOURLOGIN by your login.

Currently only 'gnome-xorg' is supported and tested.
