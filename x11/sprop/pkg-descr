sprop is a simple X property utility. Less is more.

The sprop utility prints the value of the property atom of the window with the
given xid, or alternatively sets it to value if given. It doesn't have the same
arguments as xprop and can only interact with atoms which are strings.
An example of using this utility could be replacing xprop in surf's config.h.
