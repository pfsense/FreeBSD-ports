For LightDM to function, it requires one of the available greeters to be
installed, which are available in the ports tree at x11/lightdm-*greeter*

If you enable the lock-memory option in lightdm.conf (e.g. due to security
concerns), you will also need to increase the maximum amount of memory FreeBSD
will allow a daemon to lock into main memory using mlock(2).
To increase this limit, run the following commands:
# sed -i '' -e 's/memorylocked=128M/memorylocked=256M/' /etc/login.conf
# cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf
EOD,
	type: install
}
