The X Rendering Extension introduces digital image composition as the
foundation of a rendering model within the X Window System. Rendering
geometric figures is accomplished by client-side tessellation into
either triangles or trapezoids. Text is drawn by loading glyphs into
the server and rendering sets of them.

This package contains the client library for connecting to a Xserver
that supports the Xrender extension.
