Metalock is an enhanced screen locker for the X11 windowing system. It is
designed to be used with a background screen daemon, such as xidle.

Current features include:
	- Support for pixmap (image) xpm background and login box.
	- It gives visual feedback as you type the password (Shows username and
	  * for each character of password typed.)
	- Bind arbitrary commands to key combinations (allows tasks such as
	  pause/un-pause music without unlocking the screen)
	- Optional XFT support for anti-aliased fonts. (This is optional in case
	  greater security is desired)
	- Optional Imlib2 support for use of png or jpg formats, which are more
	  appropriate for photos or high-color images than xpm.
	- Portable to most UNIX-like operating systems, developed on FreeBSD.
