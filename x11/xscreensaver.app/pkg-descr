XScreenSaver.App is a simple WindowMaker dockapp that allows you
to lock your screen (using XScreenSaver by default) with a single
left-click of the mouse. The dockapp also allows you to configure
XScreenSaver by right-clicking on the app.

The left- and right-click behaviors are configurable, so this app
can work with applications other than XScreenSaver.
