rofi plugin that uses libqalculate's qalc to parse natural language input and
provide results.

Since this uses libqalculate's amazing qalc you can try natural language
queries such 500 + 25% or 5000 EUR to USD or 150 to hex. It can also solve
linear equations on the fly. Try 60x + 30 = 50, for instance.
