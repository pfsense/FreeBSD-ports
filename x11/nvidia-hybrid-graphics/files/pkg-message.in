Running Xorg-nvidia-headless at startup is recommended especially on mobile
systems since leaving Nvidia GPU powered on with no Xorg may consume
significantly more power.

# sysrc nvidia_xorg_enable=YES
# service nvidia_xorg start

The Xorg instance uses separate configuration files from the defaults for Xorg:

    %%PREFIX%%/etc/X11/xorg-nvidia-headless.conf.d/

    %%PREFIX%%/etc/X11/xorg-nvidia-headless-template.conf
        Only used if xorg-nvidia-headless.conf does not exist.
	This file is passed through nvidia-xconfig, which does not preserve
	all options.

    %%PREFIX%%/etc/X11/xorg-nvidia-headless.conf
        Created by manually invoking %%PREFIX%%/bin/nvidia-headless-xconfig.
        Once created, this configuration is not passed through nvidia-xconfig.

Configuration is not normally needed for typical OpenGL acceleration usage.

A properly configured xorg-nvidia-headless.conf will allow Xorg-nvidia-headless
to be started by non-superuser if Xorg has been installed setuid.
