Copy sfwbar.config from %%DATADIR%% to ~/.config/sfwbar/.
If you prefer to start with something more like tint2 bar, you can copy t2.config into ~/.config/sfwbar/sfwbar.config instead.
If you want something like waybar, you can copy wbar.config and if you prefer something from the darker side, w10.config could be for you.
For more information on the format of configuration file, please see the man page

If you're using sway, you may want to add the following lines to your sway config file to open windows as floating by default:

# open new windows as floating by default
for_window [app_id="[.]*"] floating enable
# set Alt-tab as a task switcher combo
bindsym Alt+Tab bar hidden_state toggle 
# set $mod+c to hide/unhide taskbar 
bindsym $mod+c bar mode toggle
