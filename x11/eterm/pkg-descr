Eterm is a color vt102 terminal emulator intended as a replacement for
xterm. It is designed with a Freedom of Choice philosophy, leaving as
much power, flexibility, and freedom as possible in the hands of the
user. It is designed to look good and work well, but takes a
feature-rich approach rather than one of minimalism while still
maintaining speed and efficiency.
