hhpc is an utility that hides the mouse pointer in X11. It functions by
grabbing your mouse pointer at startup and replacing its bitmap with an
empty one (thus hiding it). Then, it waits for the X server to notify it
when a user tries to move or click the pointer. At this point, hhpc
relinquishes control, replays the action the user just tried to execute and
waits for the specified number of seconds (flag -i) before trying to grab
the pointer and hide it again.

Should hhpc not work out for you, unclutter is a good alternative. hhpc was
created because unclutter doesn't seem to interoperate properly with
hardware accelerated surfaces like those of video players using VAAPI.
