Xrdb is a command line utility to manage the X server resource database
for the current session.

Xrdb is used to get or set the contents of the RESOURCE_MANAGER
property on the root window of screen 0, or the SCREEN_RESOURCES
property on the root window of any or all screens, or everything
combined. This program is normally run from the X startup file.
