Pmenu is a pie menu utility for X. Pmenu receives a menu specification
in stdin, shows a menu for the user to select one of the options,
and outputs the option selected to stdout.

Pmenu comes with the following features:

- Pmenu reads something in and prints something out, the UNIX way.
- Submenus (some pie-menu slices can spawn another menu).
- Icons (pie-menu slices can contain icon image).
- X resources support (you don't need to recompile pmenu for configuring it).

Check out the other project, xclickroot for an application that can spawn pmenu
by right clicking on the root window (i.e., on the desktop).
