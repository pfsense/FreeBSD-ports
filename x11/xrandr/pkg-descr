Xrandr is used to set the size, orientation and/or reflection of the
outputs for a screen. It can also set the screen size.

If invoked without any option, it will dump the state of the outputs,
showing the existing modes for each of them, with a '+' after the
preferred modes and a '*' after the current mode.
