To use these drivers, make sure that you have loaded the NVidia kernel
module, by running

	# kldload %%KLDNAME%%

on the command line, or by putting ``%%KLDNAME%%'' on the ``kld_list''
variable in /etc/rc.conf, either manually or by running

	# sysrc kld_list+=%%KLDNAME%%

If you build this port with FreeBSD AGP GART driver, make sure you have
agp.ko kernel module installed and loaded, since nvidia.ko will depend
on it, or have your kernel compiled with "device agp".  Otherwise, the
NVidia kernel module will not load.  Also, please set correct value for
``Option "NvAGP"'' in ``Device'' section of your X11 configuration file.

When building with Linux compatibility support, make sure that linux.ko
module is available as well (or have it compiled in kernel).  It can be
loaded via /boot/loader.conf, or later in the boot process if you add

	linux_enable="YES"

to your /etc/rc.conf.

If X.org cannot start and reports

	(EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to obtain a shared memory identifier.

in /var/log/Xorg.0.log while actually you have ``options SYSVSHM''
enabled in kernel, the sysctl ``kern.ipc.shmall'' should be increased.

Because in certain 570 versions GSP firmware is known to cause issues
with suspend/resume, thus, disabled by default for now.
On the other hand, some GPUs are known NOT to work without GSP
firmware support.
To enable GSP firmware add hw.nvidia.registry.EnableGpuFirmware=1
to your loader.conf.
