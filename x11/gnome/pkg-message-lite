The GNOME desktop Lite edition has been successfully installed.

The Lite edition only includes the minimal components to get a working GNOME
Desktop. The user then has to install prefered applications like editor, web
browser or e-mail client. If you wish to install the full desktop, you can
remove this port, and install the x11/gnome port or package.  That can be
best accomplished using the following commands:

# pkg_delete gnome-lite
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome
# make install clean

Alternatively, you can install additional GNOME components individually
using either their ports or packages.

For more help on using GNOME on FreeBSD, please see the FreeBSD GNOME project
site at http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome.
