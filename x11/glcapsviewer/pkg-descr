The OpenGL hardware capability viewer collects information on one's graphics
card OpenGL implementation, including hardware capabilities, extensions,
compressed texture formats, etc. and displays them in an easy to browse way.

This data can then be uploaded to online database that developers can use to
check on OpenGL features and support for different graphics cards available
on the market.
