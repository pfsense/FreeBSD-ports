Nwg-drawer is an application launcher. It's being developed with sway
and Hyprland in mind, but should also work with other wlroots-based
Wayland compositors.

The "nwg-drawer" command displays the application grid. The search
entry allows to look for installed applications, and for files in XDG
user directories. The grid view may also be filtered by categories.
