nwg-drawer displays the application grid. The search entry
allows to look for installed applications, and for files in XDG user
directories. The grid view may also be filtered by categories.

nwg-drawer is a golang replacement to nwggrid from nwg-launchers.
It's being developed with sway in mind, but should also work with
other wlroots-based Wayland compositors.
