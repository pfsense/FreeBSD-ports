grabc is s simple but very useful program to determine the color string in hex
(or RGB components) by clicking on a pixel on the screen. While web browsing,
lots of time you find a nice color and wonder what color is that! Well just

When this program is run, the mouse pointer is grabbed and changed to a cross
hair and when the mouse is clicked, the color of the clicked pixel is written
to stdout in hex prefixed with #. It will the R, G, B component also in the
stderr.
