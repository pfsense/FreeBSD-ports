When using the panel appmenu as an XFCE menu applet, you have to configure
the appmenu to show in the panel applet, rather than on each individual window.

This configuration should remove any 'double' menus you may experience:

# xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Gtk/ShellShowsMenubar -n -t bool -s true
# xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Gtk/ShellShowsAppmenu -n -t bool -s true

This configuration will load the appmenu-gtk-module for XFCE: 

# xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Gtk/Modules -n -t string -s "appmenu-gtk-module"
EOD,
	type: install
}
]
