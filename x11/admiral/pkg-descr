Merge concurrent outputs for a status bar.

Programs like lemonbar and i3bar have become popular in recent years, and with
good reason. These programs read from standard input and then output what they
receive on a status bar. For the most part, their output is identical to their
input, but they accept some format strings which allow the user to specify
things like colors, justification, and clickable areas.

A typical status bar script looks something like this: a shell script, is used
to collect and format the output of various commands. The main problem with this
method is that it's rather difficult to handle timing correctly. A counter
showing the number of outdated programs on the system can be updated less
frequently than a clock.

Admiral runs programs specified by the user and prints their output. It allows
for a clear separation of different sections, which simplifies configuration.
Each program is run in its own thread. This means that each section is updated
independently of the other sections. It also means that if something fails, it
fails independently of the other sections.
