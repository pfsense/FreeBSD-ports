An emoji selector plugin for Rofi that copies the selected emoji to the
clipboard, among other things.

The plugin adds a Rofi mode that displays a menu of emojis and allows
searching by emoji names and their tags. The selected emoji can be
copied or inserted. See the project web site or the optional port
documentation for more features and configuration options.

The plugin can be used, for example, by running Rofi with the following
flags:

  rofi -modi emoji -show emoji
