wdisplays is a graphical application for configuring displays in
Wayland compositors. It borrows some code from kanshi. It should work
in any compositor that implements wlr-output-management-unstable-v1.
Compositors known to support the protocol are Sway and Wayfire.
wdisplays' goal is to allow precise adjustment of display settings in
kiosks, digital signage, and other elaborate multi-monitor setups.
