wvkbd project aims to deliver a minimal but practically usable
implementation of a wlroots on-screen keyboard in legible C. This will
only be a keyboard, not a feedback buzzer, led blinker, or anything
that requires more than what's needed to input text quickly. The end
product should be a static codebase that can be patched to add new
features.

Features:
- Typing, modifier locking, layout switching
- Positive visual feedback on key presses
- Custom layouts and underlying keymaps
- On-the-fly layout and keymap switching
- Custom color schemes
- Proper font drawing
- Intuitive layouts
- International layouts (cyrillic, arabic)
- Support for 'Copy' keys which are not on the keymap
- Emoji support
- Compose key for character variants (e.g. diacritics)
- Show/hide keyboard on signals (SIGUSR1 = hide, SIGUSR2 = show)
- Automatic portrait/landscape detection and subsequent layout switching
