The XFree86-DGA extension is an X server extension for allowing client
programs direct access to the video frame buffer.

XFree86-DGA is not intended as a direct rendering API, but rather, as a
mechanism to "get the X Server out of the way" so that some other
direct rendering API can have full access to the hardware.  With this
in mind, DGA does provide clients some direct access to the hardware
without requiring a separate rendering API, but this access is limited
to direct linear framebuffer access.
