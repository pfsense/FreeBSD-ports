Terminology is a terminal emulator bristling with advanced features including:
tabs, splits, 256-color support, wallpapers (even animated ones), in-line
display of media (click on a file path to a video and watch it play),
link detection, compressed scrollback stored in RAM, translucency and
a gorgeous look and feel inspired by classic CRT monitors.
