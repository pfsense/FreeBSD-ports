A program that calculates your astronomical ephemerides.

By default, it will give you the current Moon phase and, if any, the events that
will occur today. To get the rise, culmination and set of the objects of the
Solar system, you will need to give it your position on Earth: get your current
coordinates (with OpenStreetMap for instance), and give them to Kosmorro by
invoking it with the following parameters: --latitude=X --longitude=Y (replace X
by the latitude and Y by the longitude).

Kosmorro has a lot of available options. To get a list of them, run kosmorro
--help, or read its manual with man kosmorro.

Note: the first time it runs, Kosmorro will download some important files needed
to make the computations. They are stored in a cache folder named
~/.kosmorro-cache .
