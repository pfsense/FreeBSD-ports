The Astro::ADS module is an objected orientated Perl interface to the
Astrophysics Data System (ADS) abstract service. The ADS is a NASA-funded
project whose main resource is an Abstract Service, which includes four sets
of abstracts:
   1) astronomy and astrophysics, containing 719,449 abstracts;
   2) instrumentation, containing 608,834 abstracts;
   3) physics and geophysics, containing 1,079,814 abstracts; and
   4) Los Alamos preprint server, containing 4,104 abstracts.
Each dataset can be searched by author, object name (astronomy only), title,
or abstract text words.
