CalcMySky is a software package that simulates scattering of light by the
atmosphere to render daytime and twilight skies (without stars).  Its
primary purpose is to enable realistic view of the sky in applications
such as planetaria.  Secondary objective is to make it possible to explore
atmospheric effects such as glories, fogbows, etc., as well as simulate
unusual environments such as on Mars or an exoplanet orbiting a star with
a non-solar spectrum of radiation.

The simulation is based on E. Bruneton's "Precomputed Atmospheric
Scattering" paper and the updated implementation of the demo.  This in
particular limits the atmosphere to spherical symmetry (which means
localized clouds are not supported, and ground albedo is the same all
around the globe).

An additional capability is simulation of solar eclipses, which is
currently limited to two scattering orders, while the non-eclipsed
atmosphere can be simulated to arbitrary order.
