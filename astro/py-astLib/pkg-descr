astLib is a set of Python modules that provides some tools for research
astronomers. It can be used for simple plots, statistics, common calculations,
coordinate conversions, and manipulating FITS images with World Coordinate
System (WCS) information through PyWCSTools - a simple wrapping of WCSTools by
Jessica Mink. PyWCSTools is distributed (and developed) as part of astLib.
