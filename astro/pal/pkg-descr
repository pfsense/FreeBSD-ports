The PAL library is a partial re-implementation of Pat Wallace's popular SLALIB
library written in C using a Gnu GPL license and layered on top of the IAU's
SOFA library (or the BSD-licensed ERFA) where appropriate. PAL attempts to stick
to the SLA C API where possible although palObs() has a more C-like API than the
equivalent slaObs() function. In most cases it is enough to simply change the
function prefix of a routine in order to link against PAL rather than SLALIB.
Routines calling SOFA use modern notation and precession models so will return
slightly different answers than native SLALIB. PAL functions not available in
SOFA were ported from the Fortran version of SLALIB that ships as part of the
Starlink software and uses a GPL licence.
