Python libraries for simulating solar irradiation at any point on Earth.

This package provides functions to calculate solar position (azimuth and
altitude) and estimate solar radiation received at a given location and time.
It accounts for atmospheric effects and can be used for solar energy analysis,
astronomy, and climate research.

The library supports timezone-aware datetime objects and provides accurate
calculations based on established solar models.
