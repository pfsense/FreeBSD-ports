Astro::Coords is a class for manipulating and transforming astronomical
coordinates. Can handle the following coordinate types:
- Equatorial RA/Dec, galactic (including proper motions and parallax)
- Planets
- Comets/Asteroids
- Fixed locations in azimuth and elevations
- Interpolated apparent coordinates

For time dependent calculations a telescope location and reference time must be
provided. See Astro::Telescope and DateTime for details on specifying location
and reference epoch.
