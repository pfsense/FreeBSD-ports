- An Astrometric Plate Solver for Mac, Linux, and Windows, built on
  Astrometry.net and SEP (sextractor)
- Meant to be an internal library for use in a program like KStars for internal
  plate solving on all supported operating systems
- Python is not required for the library
- Netpbm is not required for the library
- Internal Library, so calls to external programs are not required
- No Astrometry.cfg file is needed, the settings are internal to the program
- Directly loads the image data into SEP and then takes the generated xy-list
  internally from Sextractor into astrometry.net, so there is no need to save
  any files.
- No temporary files need to be created for solving and no WCS file needs to be
  created to read the solved information. Although astrometry.net does monitor
  for the creation of 2 files indicating that a field is solved or a cancel was
  made, so these are created for now.
- The Index Files are still required for solving images, but the program or the
  user can specify the folder locations rather than putting them in the config
  file.
