Xplanet was inspired by Xearth, which renders an image of the earth into the X
root window. Xplanet uses the Imlib library to read user supplied maps of the
earth (or another planet). Orthographic and Mercator projections can be
rendered to the root window or saved to a file. An image that the user can
rotate interactively can be popped up in a window using OpenGL or Mesa.
