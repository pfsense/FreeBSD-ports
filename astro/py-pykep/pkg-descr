pykep is a scientific library providing basic tools for astrodynamics research.
Algorithmic efficiency is a main focus of the library, which is written in C++
and exposed to Python using the boost::python library. At the library core is
the implementation of an efficient solver for the multiple revolutions Lambert's
problem, objects representing direct (Sims-Flanagan), indirect (Pontryagin) and
hybrid methods to represent low-thrust optimization problems, efficient
keplerian propagators, Taylor-integrators, a SGP4 propagator, TLE and SATCAT
support and more.
