This program generates, but does not display, image files containing
raster maps of the Earth. It includes public-domain, vector data from
which they are drawn, describing the continents, bodies of water,
boundaries of countries and U.S. states, and a few cities. Command-line
options allow centering the maps at a particular latitude and longitude
and zooming in.
