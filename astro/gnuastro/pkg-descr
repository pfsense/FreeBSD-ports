The GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro) is an official GNU software package
consisting of various programs and library functions for the manipulation
and analysis of astronomical data.  All the programs share the same basic
command-line user interface enabling easy and efficient operation combined
with other installed programs in shell scripts or Makefiles; the libraries
are also usable in C and C++ programs.
