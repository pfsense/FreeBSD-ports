Metar is a python package for interpreting METAR and SPECI weather reports.

This module extracts the data recorded in the main-body groups of reports that
follow the WMO spec or the US conventions, except for the runway state and trend
groups, which are parsed but ignored. The most useful remark groups defined in
the US spec are parsed, as well, such as the cumulative precipitation, min/max
temperature, peak wind and sea-level pressure groups. No other regional
conventions are formally supported, but a large number of variant formats found
in international reports are accepted.
