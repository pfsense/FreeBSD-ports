The astropy-helpers package includes many build, installation, and
documentation-related tools used by the Astropy project, but packaged
separately for use by other projects that wish to leverage this work.
The motivation behind this package and details of its implementation
are in the accepted Astropy Proposal for Enhancement (APE) 4.
