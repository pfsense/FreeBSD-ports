This package accesses the Space-Track web site,
http://www.space-track.org, and retrieves orbital data from this site.
You must register and get a username and password before you can make
use of this package, and you must abide by the site's restrictions,
which include not making the data available to a third party.

In addition, the celestrak method queries http://celestrak.com/ for a
named data set, and then queries http://www.space-track.org/ for the
orbital elements of the objects in the data set.

Beginning with version 0.017, there is provision for retrieval of
historical data.

Nothing is exported by default, but the shell method/subroutine can be
exported if you so desire.

Most methods return an HTTP::Response object. See the individual
method document for details. Methods which return orbital data on
success add a 'Pragma: spacetrack-type = orbit' header to the
HTTP::Response object if the request succeeds.
