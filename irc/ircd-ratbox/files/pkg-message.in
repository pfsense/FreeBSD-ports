  message: <<EOM
ircd-ratbox has been successfully installed.

Sample 'ircd.conf' and 'ircd.motd' files have been created in the
ircd-ratbox configuration directory. A sample configuration file is
included for EFNet-like configurations that can be used instead. You
should now edit these files as per the ratbox documentation.
A configured ircd.conf file is required to start the server.

Once you have added ircd_ratbox_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf, the
server can be started by running:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/ircd-ratbox start

You can check your ircd.conf configuration file for syntactical errors
using the following rc.d script command:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/ircd-ratbox conftest

The ban.db database should be checked and updated using 'bantool -u'.
For safety, bantool updates must be done while no ircd is running and
before starting the new version.

	%%PREFIX%%/bin/bantool -u

Notice: ircd-ratbox has been updated to follow the current stable
release branch (3.0.x). All previous branches are no longer supported
by the ratbox team. Users of ircd-ratbox are advised to create new ircd
configuration files based on the examples provided.

For more information on upgrading, see:

	http://svn.ratbox.org/svnroot/ircd-ratbox/trunk/INSTALL

Be sure to check out 'ratbox-services' if you need a services package.
