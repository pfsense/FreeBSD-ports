HexChat is an IRC chat program.
It allows you to join multiple IRC channels (chat rooms) at
the same time, talk publicly, private one-on-one conversations etc.

HexChat is based on XChat, but unlike XChat it's completely
free for both Windows and Unix-like systems.
Since XChat is Open Source, it's perfectly legal.
