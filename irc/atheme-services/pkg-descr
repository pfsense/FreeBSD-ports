atheme-services is a set of Services for IRC networks that allows
users to manage their channels in a secure and efficient way and
allows operators to manage various things about their networks. Unlike
it's predecessor, Shrike, services has a completely reworked form of
channel management that feels somewhat like eggdrop and is somewhat
more useful.

Services currently works with many irc daemons. More details are
available in the config file.

Internally, atheme-services shares more similarities with ircd than it
does with IRCServices. Anope/Epona, Cygnus, OperStats, Hybserv, Theia,
etc are all based on IRCServices and as such have very old legacy code
that none of the authors, except Church truly understand. Atheme was
written completely from scratch with the more complex concepts taken
from various modern ircd packages, including ircu, ircd-ratbox, hybrid
and bahamut.

atheme-services is not a drop-in replacement for Anope or Andy
Church's IRC Services. It is designed with an entirely different set
of goals and as such should not be migrated to with the expectation
that it will behave exactly like what was previously implemented.
Atheme is designed to act as a directory server, with alternative ways
of getting to the data implemented as well as the IRC presence.
