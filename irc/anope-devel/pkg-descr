Anope is a set of Services for IRC networks that allows users to
manage their nicks and channels in a secure and efficient way, and
administrators to manage their network with powerful tools.

Anope currently works with:
  - InspIRCd 3 or later
  - UnrealIRCd 6 or later
  - ircd-hybrid 8.2.34 or later
  - ircd-ratbox 3 or later
  - ngIRCd 19.2 or later

Anope could also work with some of the daemons derived by the ones listed
above, but there's no support for them if they work or don't work.

For mysql support, please install -mysql FLAVOR.
