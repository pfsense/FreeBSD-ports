POE::Component::IRC is a POE component (who'd have guessed?) which acts
as an easily controllable IRC client for your other POE components and
sessions.  You create an IRC component and tell it what events your
session cares about and where to connect to, and it sends back
interesting IRC events when they happen.  You make the client do things
by sending it events.
