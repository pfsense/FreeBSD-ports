ngIRCd is a free, portable and lightweight Internet Relay Chat server
for small or private networks, developed under the GNU General Public
License. It is simple to configure, can cope with dynamic IP addresses,
and supports IPv6 as well as SSL. It is written from scratch and not
based on the original IRCd.
