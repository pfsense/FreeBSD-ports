icbirc is a proxy that allows to connect an IRC client to an ICB server.
The proxy accepts client connections, connects to the server, and for-
wards data between those two connections.

Commands from the IRC client are translated to ICB commands and forwarded
to the ICB server. Messages from the ICB server are translated to IRC
messages and forwarded to the IRC client.
