Sopel was installed and there are some notes:

1. The default profile or configuration file is installed in
%%ETCDIR%%/sopel-default.cfg.

2. The default profile uses logdir (/var/log/sopel), pid_dir
(/var/run/sopel) and homedir (/var/db/sopel) directories, which are
already created. You can change them in %%ETCDIR%%/sopel-default.cfg.

3. Enable sopel with:
sysrc sopel_enable="YES"

4. Sopel can configure the common options with:
service sopel configure

5. Before starting sopel, it must be configured using service sopel configure
or directly in the configuration file. After it is configured, the
not_configured parameter in the configuration file must be removed
or change its value to False.

6. The service can run multiple instances of sopel, the default
profile is "default". You can change or add more profiles by making
a copy or creating other files with the prefix sopel- and the name
of the profile:

cp %%ETCDIR%%/sopel-default.cfg.sample %%ETCDIR%%/sopel-profile1.cfg
cp %%ETCDIR%%/sopel-default.cfg.sample %%ETCDIR%%/sopel-profile2.cfg
cp %%ETCDIR%%/sopel-default.cfg.sample %%ETCDIR%%/sopel-profile3.cfg

Edit and add them in /etc/rc.conf:

sysrc sopel_profiles+="profile1 profile2 profile3"

7. Each plugin has its own configuration. If you observe strange behavior, please
make sure you have configured the module correctly before reporting it as a bug.

8. Start the service:
service sopel start
