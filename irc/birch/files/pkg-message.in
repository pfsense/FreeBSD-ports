Caveats (or limitations):
=========================

* Nick column is fixed and truncated to 10 columns wide.
  
  This is something fixable down the line. It merely serves to
  simplify the alignment of messages into two columns (nick and
  messages).

* Lines are word-wrapped to a fixed 60 columns.

  This is also fixable down the line though a lot more painful
  than the nick column issue. POSIX fold is used to achieve the
  word wrapping but doesn't take into account non-printable
  characters and unicode.

  What this means is that wrapping will always be a little _off_
  as escape sequences, IRC formatting and unicode will throw
  out all attempts at calculating the "visible" line length.

  It's an interesting problem to solve. I've made a myriad of
  attempts at writing a suitable function in bash though they're
  all too slow (as expected!).

* No automatic server reconnect.

  This should be fairly easy to fix though I need to figure out
  the best way of doing so.

* No SSL (sadly).

  The network connection is through bash's builtin /dev/tcp
  feature which doesn't allow for SSL.

Keybindings:
============

Ctrl+n - Next buffer.
Ctrl+p - Previous buffer.
Tab    - Completion of nicks and channels.

Further, all readline keybindings are available for use. See the
readline or bash manpages for a list of these. 

Keybindings to birch may also be set via a .inputrc file. Which
can be configured by setting `$BIRCH_INPUTRC`.
