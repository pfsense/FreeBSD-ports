Gruftistats is a program which reads your IRC logs and turns them into
a web page.  This has a mixture of statistics (like who talked most),
and amusing facts (like who got kicked most).

It supports a variety of log formats already, and can be extended to
support other log formats by writing a spec file describing the
format.
