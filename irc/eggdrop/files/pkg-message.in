This Port of Eggdrop differs from a normal eggdrop installation, because
it does respect hier(7). That means your eggdrop.conf goes to
%%PREFIX%%/etc/eggdrop.conf and .chan, .notes, .user files go to
%%PREFIX%%/share/eggdrop. Modules will go to %%PREFIX%%/lib/eggdrop and
documentation can be found in %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/eggdrop, scripts go
to %%PREFIX%%/share/eggdrop/scripts.
