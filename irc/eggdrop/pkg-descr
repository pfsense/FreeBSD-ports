Eggdrop is the world's most popular open source Internet Relay Chat (IRC) bot.
Originally created by Robey Pointer in December 1993, it has spawned an almost
cult like following of users. It is a feature rich program designed to be
easily used and expanded upon (using Tcl scripting) by both novice and
advanced IRC users on a variety of hardware and software platforms.
