JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, http://json.org) is a lightweight
data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for
machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript
Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. This
feature can also be found in Python. JSON is a text format that is completely
language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of
the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, TCL,
and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

This package provides a simple encoder and decoder for JSON notation. It is
intended for use with client-side Javascript applications that make use of
HTTPRequest to perform server communication functions - data can be encoded into
JSON notation for use in a client-side javascript, or decoded from incoming
Javascript requests. JSON format is native to Javascript, and can be directly
eval()'ed with no further parsing overhead.
