In order to be compatible with legacy web content when interpreting
something like Content-Type: text/html; charset=latin1, tools need
to use a particular set of aliases for encoding labels as well as
some overriding rules.

For example, US-ASCII and iso-8859-1 on the web are actually aliases for
windows-1252, and an UTF-8 or UTF-16 BOM takes precedence over any other
encoding declaration.

The Encoding standard defines all such details so that implementations
do not have to reverse-engineer each other.

This module has encoding labels and BOM detection, but the actual
implementation for encoders and decoders is Python's.
