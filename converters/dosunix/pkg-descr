The suite of utilities known as DosUnix provide a selection of features
allowing manipulation of text files in a mixed DOS/Windows and Unix
environment.

The three utilities are:

   - dosunix, which creates a copy of a DOS text file in Unix text format;
   - unixdos, which creates a copy of a Unix text file in DOS text format;
   - chktxt, which inspects a given text file to determine whether it is in
     DOS text format or Unix text format.
