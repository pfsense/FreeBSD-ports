Lua-iconv is POSIX 'iconv' binding for the Lua Programming Language. The iconv
library converts a sequence of characters from one codeset into a sequence of
corresponding characters in another codeset. The codesets are those specified
in the iconv.new() call that returned the conversion descriptor, cd.
