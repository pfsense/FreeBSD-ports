Psiconv is a file conversion utility that converts between Psion 5(MX) files
and more commonly-used *nux file formats. It can read Psion Word, TextEd,
Sketch, MBM, and Clipart files, and outputs HTML 3.2, HTML 4, ASCII, and
almost any graphical format. The libpsiconv library can also read Sheet files
and output Word and TextEd files for use in other programs. Included is full
documentation on several Psion 5(MX) file formats. This information is not
available from Psion (it has been reverse-engineered from Psion files), and
it's free for anybody to use.
