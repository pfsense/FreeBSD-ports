This is an update of Benjamin Lin's implementations of dos2unix and
unix2dos.  Benjamin Lin's implementations of dos2unix and unix2dos were
distributed via SunSITE.unc.edu (later MetaLab.unc.edu, now ibiblio)
and became part of several Linux distributions such as RedHat, Suse,
Gentoo, and others. This update includes all RedHat patches and fixes
several other problems. Internationalization has been added and ports
to DOS, Windows, Cygwin and OS/2 Warp have been made.
