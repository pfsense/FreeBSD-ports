This module provide a compatibility layer for Encode.pm users
on perl versions earlier than v5.7.1. It translates whatever
call it receives into Text::Iconv, or (in the future)
Unicode::MapUTF8 to perform the actual work.

Currently, this module only support 5.6.1, and merely provides
the three utility function above (encode(), decode() and from_to()),
with a very kludgy FB_HTMLCREF fallback against latin-1 in from_to().
