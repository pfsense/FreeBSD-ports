xml2c reads in an XML file and produces equivalent C source code, suitable for
#including in your program. The C version is probably easier deal with in your
code. You don't have to read and parse the XML file and then look for the nodes
you want; instead you just loop through a bunch of structs. Or maybe you just
don't want to distribute extra files with your app, and would rather build them
into the executable.
