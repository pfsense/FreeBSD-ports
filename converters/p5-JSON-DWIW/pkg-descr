Other JSON modules require setting several parameters before calling the
conversion methods to do what I want. This module does things by default
that I think should be done when working with JSON in Perl. This module also
encodes and decodes faster than JSON.pm and JSON::Syck in my benchmarks.

This means that any piece of data in Perl will get converted to something in
JSON instead of throwing an exception. It also means that output will be
strict JSON, while accepted input will be flexible, without having to set
any options.
