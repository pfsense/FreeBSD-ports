Normality is a Python micro-package that contains a small set of text
normalization functions for easier re-use. These functions accept a snippet of
unicode or utf-8 encoded text and remove various classes of characters, such as
diacritics, punctuation etc. This is useful as a preparation to further text
analysis.
