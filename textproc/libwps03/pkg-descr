Libwps is a library (for use by word procesors, for example) for importing the
Microsoft Works word processor file format. It imports Works format versions 2,
3, 4, 5 (aka 2000), and 8 with some formatting. The scope of this project is
just a Works word processor import filter, so there are no plans for supporting
an export filter, spreadsheets, or databases.
