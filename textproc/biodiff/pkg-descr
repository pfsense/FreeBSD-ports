biodiff is a tool for binary diffing.

The tool is able to show two binary files side by side so that similar places
will be at the same position on both sides and bytes missing from one side are
padded.

It uses bio-informatics algorithms from the rust-bio library, typically used
for DNA sequence alignment, for that.
The dialog boxes for configuration are done using the github.com/gyscos/cursive
library.
