Text::CSV_XS provides facilities for the composition and decomposition of
comma-separated values. An instance of the Text::CSV_XS class can combine
fields into a CSV string and parse a CSV string into fields.

The module accepts either strings or files as input and can utilize any
user-specified characters as delimiters, separators, and escapes so it is
perhaps better called ASV (anything separated values) rather than just CSV.
