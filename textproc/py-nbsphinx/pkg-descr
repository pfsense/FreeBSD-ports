nbsphinx is a Sphinx extension that provides a source parser for *.ipynb files.
Custom Sphinx directives are used to show Jupyter Notebook code cells (and of
course their results) in both HTML and LaTeX output. Unevaluated notebooks --
i.e. notebooks without stored output cells -- will be automatically executed
during the Sphinx build process.
