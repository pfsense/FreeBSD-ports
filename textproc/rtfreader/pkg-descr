RTF is the Microsoft Richtext Format, a more portable, mostly-ASCII
formatting language that is exported by word processors like MS Word.
These files generally have the extension .rtf, but occassionally have
.doc extensions as well.  This parser is from the Microsoft spec,
"ported" to Unix systems.
