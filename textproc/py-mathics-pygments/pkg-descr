This is a lexer and highlighter for Mathematica/Wolfram Language source code
using the pygments engine.

It currently supports:
- All builtin functions in the System context including unicode symbols except
  those that use characters from the private unicode space (e.g. \[FormalA]).
- User defined symbols, including those in a context.
- All operators including unicode operators like U+1D70B (pi).
- Comments, including multi line and nested.
- Strings, including multi line and escaped quotes.
- Patterns, slots (including named slots #name introduced in version 10) and
  slot sequences.
- Message names (e.g. the ivar in General::ivar)
- Numbers including base notation (e.g. 8 ^^ 23 == 19) and scientific notation
  (e.g. 1 *^ 3 == 1000).
- Local variables in Block, With and Module
