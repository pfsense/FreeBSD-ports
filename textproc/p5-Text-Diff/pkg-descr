Text::Diff provides a basic set of services akin to the diff(1) utility.
It is not anywhere near as feature complete as diff(1), but it is better
integrated with Perl and available on all platforms.  It is often faster
than shelling out to a system's diff(1) executable for small files, and
generally slower on larger files.
