This crate aims to provide a high level interface for compiling
Sass into plain CSS. It offers a very limited API, currently exposing
only 2 functions.

In addition to a library, this crate also includes a binary that
is intended to act as an invisible replacement to the Sass commandline
executable.

This crate aims to achieve complete feature parity with the dart-sass
reference implementation. A deviation from the dart-sass implementation
can be considered a bug except for in the case of error messages
and error spans.
