This library provides an engine to interpret compiled KMFL keyboard
tables (textproc/kmflcomp) written in Keyman keyboard language.

The current implementation of KMFL uses either the IBus framework (via
textproc/ibus-kmfl) or the older SCIM framework (via
textproc/scim-kmfl-imengine) to handle the input method interface to X.

KMFL aims to bring Tavultesoft Keyman functionality to *nix operating
systems. KMFL is being jointly developed by SIL International
(http://www.sil.org) and Tavultesoft (http://www.tavultesoft.com).
