The po4a (PO for anything) project goal is to ease translations (and more
interestingly, the maintenance of translations) using gettext tools on areas
where they were not expected like documentation.

po4a currently supports the following formats:
* manpages
* POD
* XML (generic, DocBook, XHTML, Dia, Guide, or WML)
* SGML
* TeX (generic, LaTeX, or Texinfo)
* text (simple text files with some formatting, markdown, or AsciiDoc)
* INI
* KernelHelp
