PEAR::XML_HTMLSax provides an API very similar to the native PHP XML
extension (http://www.php.net/xml), allowing handlers using one to be easily
adapted to the other.

The key difference is HTMLSax will not break on badly formed XML, allowing it
to be used for parsing HTML documents. Otherwise HTMLSax supports all the
handlers available from Expat except namespace and external entity handlers.

Provides methods for handling XML escapes as well as JSP/ASP opening and close
tags.
