Asciidoctor PDF is a native PDF converter for AsciiDoc. It bypasses the
requirement to generate an intermediary format such as DocBook, Apache FO, or
LaTeX. Instead, you can use this extension to convert your documents directly
from AsciiDoc to PDF. Its aim is to take the pain out of creating PDF documents
from AsciiDoc.
