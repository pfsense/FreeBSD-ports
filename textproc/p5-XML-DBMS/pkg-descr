XML-DBMS is middleware for transferring data between XML documents and
relational databases.  It views the XML document as a tree of
data-specific objects in which element types are generally viewed as
classes and attributes and PCDATA as properties of those classes.  It
then uses an object-relational mapping to map these objects to the
database.  An XML-based mapping language is used to define the view and
map it to the database.
