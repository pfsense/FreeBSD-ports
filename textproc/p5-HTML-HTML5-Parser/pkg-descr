HTML::HTML5::Parse is substantially the same as the non-CPAN module
Whatpm::HTML. Changes include:
    * Provides an XML::LibXML-like DOM interface. If you usually use
XML::LibXML's DOM parser, this should be a drop-in solution for tag
soup HTML.
    * Constructs an XML::LibXML::Document as the result of parsing.
    * Via bundling and modifications, removed external dependencies
on non-CPAN packages.
