The goal of 'vroom' is to read and write data (like 'csv', 'tsv'
and 'fwf') quickly. When reading it uses a quick initial indexing
step, then reads the values lazily , so only the data you actually
use needs to be read. The writer formats the data in parallel and
writes to disk asynchronously from formatting.
