A cross-platform parser for the Windows XML EventLog format

Features:

- Implemented using 100% safe rust - and works on all platforms supported by
  rust (that have stdlib).
- It's faster than any other implementation by order(s) of magnitude!
- Multi-threaded.
- Supports XML and JSON outputs, both being directly constructed from the token
  tree and independent of each other (no xml2json conversion is performed!)
- Supports some basic recovery of missing records/chunks!
