libepubgen is a library for generating documents in ePub format, implementing
librevenge document interfaces. It supports conversion of text documents,
presentations and vector drawings. Spreadsheets are not supported. As these
interfaces are used by multiple libraries, libepubgen can be used to generate
EPUB from many sources.
