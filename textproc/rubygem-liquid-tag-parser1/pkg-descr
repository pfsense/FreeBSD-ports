Liquid Tag parser provides a robust interface to parsing your tag syntax in a
way that makes sense, it uses Shellwords, along with escapes to allow users to
do extremely robust arguments, giving you back a hash, that you get to play
with. It also has the concept of argv1, deep hashes, and even defaults if you
give them to us.
