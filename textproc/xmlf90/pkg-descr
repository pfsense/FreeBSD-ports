xmlf90 is a suite of libraries to handle XML in Fortran. It has two
major components:

* A XML parsing library. The parser was designed to be a useful
  tool in the extraction and analysis of data in the context of
  scientific computing, and thus the priorities were efficiency and the
  ability to deal with very large XML files while maintaining a small
  memory footprint. The most complete programming interface is
  based on the very successful SAX (Simple API for XML) model,
  although a partial DOM interface and a very experimental XPATH interface
  are also present.

- A library (xmlf90-wxml) that facilitates the writing of well-formed
  XML, including such features as automatic start-tag completion,
  attribute pretty-printing, and element indentation. There are also
  helper routines to handle the output of numerical arrays.
