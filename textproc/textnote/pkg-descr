textnote is a command line tool for quickly creating and managing daily plain
text notes. It is designed for ease of use to encourage the practice of daily,
organized note taking. textnote intentionally facilitates only the management
(creation, opening, organizing, and consolidated archiving) of notes, following
the philosophy that notes are best written in a text editor and not via a CLI.

All note files are stored locally on the file system in a single directory.
Notes can easily be synced to a remote server or cloud service if so desired by
ensuring the application directory is remotely synced.
