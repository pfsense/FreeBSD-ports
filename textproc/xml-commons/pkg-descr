xml-commons is focussed on common code and guidelines for xml projects. The
first focus will be to organize and have common packaging for the various
externally-defined standards code relating to XML - things like the DOM,
SAX, and JAXP interfaces.

As the xml-commons community forms, we also hope to serve as a holding area
for other common xml-related utilities and code, and to help promulgate
common packaging, testing, documentation, and other guidelines across all
xml.apache.org subprojects.
