Bibclean is a prettyprinter, portability verifier, and syntax checker for
BibTeX bibliography databases.  It can be used to find errors in .bib files, as
well as to standardize their format for readability and editing convenience. It
can also be used to convert Scribe-format bibliographies to BibTeX form.
