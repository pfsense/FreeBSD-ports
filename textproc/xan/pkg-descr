xan is a command line tool that can be used to process CSV files
directly from the shell.

It has been written in Rust to be as fast as possible, use as little
memory as possible, and can easily handle very large CSV files
(Gigabytes). It is also able to leverage parallelism (through
multithreading) to make some tasks complete as fast as your computer
can allow.

It can easily preview, filter, slice, aggregate, sort, join CSV files,
and exposes a large collection of composable commands that can be
chained together to perform a wide variety of typical tasks.

xan also leverages its own expression language so you can perform
complex tasks that cannot be done by relying on the simplest
commands. This minimalistic language has been tailored for CSV data
and is way faster than evaluating typical dynamically-typed languages
such as Python, Lua, JavaScript etc.
