This module provides a parser which parses and interprets (though
not fully) LaTeX documents and returns a tree-based representation
of what it finds. This tree is a LaTeX::TOM::Tree. The tree contains
LaTeX::TOM::Node nodes.

This module should be especially useful to anyone who wants to do
processing of LaTeX documents that requires extraction of plain-text
information, or altering of the plain-text components (or
alternatively, the math-text components).
