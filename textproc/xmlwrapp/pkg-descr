xmlwrapp is a modern style C++ library for working with XML data. It provides
a simple and easy to use interface for the very powerful libxml2 XML parser.

Features:
   * Tree parsing. XML data is parsed and a tree of xml::node objects is
     created. Similar to the DOM.
   * Event parsing. XML data is parsed as protected member functions of an
     event class are called. Similar to SAX.
   * It is easy to construct an XML tree using xml::node objects. Any
     xml::node may be inserted into an IOStream causing translation to XML
     text data.
   * Complete isolation from the backend parser due to the private
     implementation (pimpl) idiom.
