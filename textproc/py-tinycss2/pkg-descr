tinycss2 is a low-level CSS parser and generator: it can parse strings, return
Python objects representing tokens and blocks, and generate CSS strings
corresponding to these objects.

Based on the CSS Syntax Level 3 specification, tinycss2 knows the grammar of CSS
but doesn't know specific rules, properties or values supported in various CSS
modules.
