The codec provides a convenient way of going between text written in LaTeX and
unicode. Since it is not a LaTeX compiler, it is more appropriate for short
chunks of text, such as a paragraph or the values of a BibTeX entry, and it is
not appropriate for a full LaTeX document. In particular, its behavior on the
LaTeX commands that do not simply select characters is intended to allow the
unicode representation to be understandable by a human reader, but is not
canonical and may require hand tuning to produce the desired effect.
