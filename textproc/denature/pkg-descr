denature is a perl program that attempts to convert an HTML page into XSL-FO
which it then passes off to the FOP (Formatted Objects Formatter) to produce a
PDF document.

denature trys to use any included CSS stylesheets to figure out the properties
used in the document. The CSS processing in denature is not very mature and
only handles a limited amount of the available CSS markup. The CSS support
does not handle the contextual entries in a CSS document, and the CSS::Tiny
module requires that all the :'s in a document have a space after them.
