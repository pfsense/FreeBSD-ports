Tokay is a programming language to quickly implement solutions for text
processing problems. This can either be just simple data extractions, but also
parsing entire structures or parts of it, and turning information into
structured parse trees or abstract syntax trees for further processing.

Therefore, Tokay is both a tool and language for simple one-liners, but can also
be used to implement code-analyzers, refactoring tools, interpreters, compilers
or transpilers. Tokay's own language parser is implemented in Tokay itself.

Tokay is inspired by awk, has syntactic and semantic flavours of Python and
Rust, but also follows its own philosophy, ideas and design principles.
Thus, it isn't compareable to other languages or projects, and is a language on
its own.
