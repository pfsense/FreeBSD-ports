Data::FormValidator's main aim is to make the tedious coding of input
validation expressible in a simple format and to let the programmer focus
on more interesting tasks.

When you are coding a web application one of the most tedious though
crucial tasks is to validate user's input (usually submitted by way of
an HTML form). You have to check that each required fields is present
and that some fields have valid data. (Does the phone input looks like a
phone number? Is that a plausible email address? Is the YY state
valid? etc.) For a simple form, this is not really a problem but as
forms get more complex and you code more of them this task becames
really boring and tedious.

Data::FormValidator lets you define profiles which declare the
required fields and their format. When you are ready to validate the
user's input, you tell Data::FormValidator the profile to apply to the
user data and you get the valid fields, the name of the fields which
are missing. An array is returned listing which fields are valid,
missing, invalid and unknown in this profile.
