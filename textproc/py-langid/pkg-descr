langid.py is a standalone Language Identification (LangID) tool.

The design principles are as follows:

    Fast
    Pre-trained over a large number of languages (currently 97)
    Not sensitive to domain-specific features (e.g. HTML/XML markup)
    Single .py file with minimal dependencies
    Deployable as a web service

Remark: the main script langid/langid.py is cross-compatible with both Python2
and Python3, but the accompanying training tools are still Python2-only, hence
not installed by this port.

See also the port textproc/py-langdetect for a similar program.
