Text::Wrap::wrap() is a very simple paragraph formatter.  It formats a single
paragraph at a time by breaking lines at word boundaries.  Indentation is
controlled for the first line ($initial_tab) and all subsequent lines
($subsequent_tab) independently.

This is a later version (from CPAN) than the one that comes with the base
system's perl 5.00503.
