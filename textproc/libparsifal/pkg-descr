Parsifal is minimal non-validating XML parser written in ANSI C. Parsifal
implements the subset of SAX2 including namespace support.

Parsifal can be used for parsing XML based messages (such as SOAP and RSS) and
for application specific data processing e.g. config files, data files etc.
Parsifal can also be used for limited document-oriented processing and for
parsing modular documents because it contains supports for internal and
external general entities - it doesn't support currently parameter entities or
other DTD features. Parsifal can be used for processing large data files and
streams too since its SAX based and consumes very little memory not to mention
it is fast enough for most purposes 'cos its written in C.

Using Parsifal in place of large XML processing libraries (e.g. libxml, xerces)
or even in the place of small Expat (which is considerably bigger and more
complicated) can be justified for limited memory environments and in
applications requiring bundled parser. If you need higher level tools, for
example library supporting DTD validation or dom/xpath processing, you should
look for other libs of course.
