The tubes package provides composable flow-control and data processing.

Flow-control is control over the source, destination, and rate of
data being processed. Tubes implements this in a type-agnostic way,
meaning that a set of rules for controlling the flow of data can
control that flow regardless of the type of that data, from raw
streams of bytes to application-specific messages and back again.

Composable data processing refers to processing that can occur in
independent units. For example, the conversion of a continuous
stream of bytes into a discrete sequence of messages can be implemented
independently from the presentation of or reactions to those messages.
This allows for similar messages to be relayed in different formats
and by different protocols, but be processed by the same code.
