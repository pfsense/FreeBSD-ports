XML::Node is a Perl5 module which provides a simplified extension interface
to XML::Parser.

Paraphrasing the README:

  Instead of worrying about "start", "end", and "char" callbacks of every
  single XML node, you can simply say that you only want to be notified when
  a path is found.

  Using XML::Node, you can ignore the parts of XML files that you are not
  interested in.  Additionally, you can register a variable instead of a
  callback function.  The corresponding string found in an XML file will be
  automatically appended to your variable.
