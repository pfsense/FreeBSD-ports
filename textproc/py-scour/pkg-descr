Scour is an SVG optimizer/cleaner that reduces the size of scalable vector
graphics by optimizing structure and removing unnecessary data written in
Python.

It can be used to create streamlined vector graphics suitable for web
deployment, publishing/sharing or further processing.

The goal of Scour is to output a file that renderes identically at a fraction of
the size by removing a lot of redundant information created by most SVG editors.
Optimization options are typically lossless but can be tweaked for more
agressive cleaning.
