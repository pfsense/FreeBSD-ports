ripOLE is a small program/library designed to pull out attachments from OLE2
data files (ie, MS Office documents). ripOLE is BSD licenced meaning that
commercial projects can also use the code without worrying about licence costs
or legal liabilities.

Currently, ripOLE is in a development phase.  It can extract some files from
Microsoft Office documents.  Ultimately, what ripOLE should be able to do is
convert any embedded content in MS Office files back into its original format
(JPEG, arbitary files, movies etc).
