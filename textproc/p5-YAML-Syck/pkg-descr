This module provides a Perl interface to the libsyck data serialization
library.  It exports the Dump and Load functions for converting Perl
data structures to YAML strings, and the other way around. It also
provides an implementation of JSON parsing and generation. Because
JSON is YAML (http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/yamlIsJson.html),
using libsyck gives you the fastest and most memory efficient parser
and dumper for JSON data representation.
