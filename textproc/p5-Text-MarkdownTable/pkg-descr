Text::MarkdownTable can be used to write data in tabular form, formatted in
MultiMarkdown syntax. The resulting format can be used for instance to display
CSV data or to include data tables in Markdown files. Newlines and vertical bars
in table cells are replaced by a space character and cell values can be
truncated.
