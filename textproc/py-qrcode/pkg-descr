This module uses image libraries, Python Imaging Library (PIL) by

A Quick Response code is a two-dimensional pictographic code used
for its fast readability and comparatively large storage capacity.
The code consists of black modules arranged in a square pattern on
a white background. The information encoded can be made up of any
kind of data (e.g., binary, alphanumeric, or Kanji symbols)
