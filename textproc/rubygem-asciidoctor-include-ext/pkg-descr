This is a reimplementation of the Asciidoctor's built-in
(pre)processor for the include::[] directive in extensible
and more clean way. It provides the same features, but you
can easily adjust it or extend for your needs. For example,
you can change how it loads included files or add another
ways how to select portions of the document to include.
