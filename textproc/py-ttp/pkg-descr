TTP is a Python library for semi-structured text parsing using templates.

In essence, TTP can help to:
- Prepare, sort and load text data for parsing
- Parse text using regexes dynamically derived out of templates
- Process matches on the fly using broad set of built-in or custom functions
- Combine match results in a structure with arbitrary hierarchy
- Transform results in desired format to ease consumption by humans or machines
- Return results to various destinations for storage or further processing
