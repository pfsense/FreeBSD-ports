This package includes HTML function and methods to write in an HTML file. Thus,
making HTML reports is easy. Includes a function that allows redirection on the
fly, which appears to be very usefull for teaching purpose, as the student can
keep a copy of the produced output to keep all that he did during the course.
Package comes with a vignette describing how to write HTML reports for
statistical analysis. Finally, a driver for Sweave allows to parse HTML flat
files containing R code and to automatically write the corresponding outputs
