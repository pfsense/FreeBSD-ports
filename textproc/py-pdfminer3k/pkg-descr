pdfminer3k is a Python 3 port of pdfminer. PDFMiner is a tool for extracting
information from PDF documents. Unlike other PDF-related tools, it focuses
entirely on getting and analyzing text data. PDFMiner allows to obtain the exact
location of texts in a page, as well as other information such as fonts or
lines. It includes a PDF converter that can transform PDF files into other
text formats (such as HTML). It has an extensible PDF parser that can be used
for other purposes instead of text analysis.
