This module supports multipage tables via the xtab and the longtable
package. For publication quality tables it utilizes the booktabs
package. It also supports the tabularx and tabulary packages for
nicer fixed-width tables. Furthermore, it supports the colortbl
package for colored tables optimized for presentations.  The powerful
new ctable package is supported and especially recommended when
footnotes are needed. LaTeX::Table ships with some predefined, good
looking themes.
