Fuzzy finder written on C. fzy is faster and shows better results than other
fuzzy finders. Most other fuzzy matchers sort based on the length of a match.
fzy tries to find the result the user intended. It does this by favouring
matches on consecutive letters and starts of words. This allows matching using
acronyms or different parts of the path. fzy is designed to be used both as an
editor plugin and on the command line. Rather than clearing the screen, fzy
displays its interface directly below the current cursor position, scrolling
the screen if necessary.
