From the abstract:
  This Recommendation specifies an abstract modularization of XHTML
  and an implementation of the abstraction using XML Document Type
  Definitions (DTDs). This modularization provides a means for
  subsetting and extending XHTML, a feature needed for extending
  XHTML's reach onto emerging platforms.
