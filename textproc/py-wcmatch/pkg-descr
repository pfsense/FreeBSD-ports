Wildcard Match provides an enhanced fnmatch, glob, and pathlib library
in order to provide file matching and globbing that more closely
follows the features found in Bash. In some ways these libraries are
similar to Python's builtin libraries as they provide a similar
interface to match, filter, and glob the file system. But they also
include a number of features found in Bash's globbing such as
backslash escaping, brace expansion, extended glob pattern groups,
etc. They also add a number of new useful functions as well, such as
globmatch which functions like fnmatch, but for paths.
