After much time, effort, and with well received results,
Alfred Reibenschuh is abandoning PDF::API2.

However we have seen great progress in moving towards paperless methods.

Furthermore the PDF specification is now an ISO standard.

Now is the time to really push forward with the development of an even
better perl pdf solution.

This is a beginning toward that goal.

This version starts with PDF::API2 0.73, creating a new one of PDF::API3.
