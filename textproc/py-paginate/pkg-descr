This module helps dividing large lists of items into pages. The user is shown
one page at a time and can navigate to other pages.

Imagine you are offering a company phonebook and let the user search the
entries. If the search result contains 23 entries but you may want to
display no more than 10 entries at once.

The first page contains entries 1-10, the second 11-20 and the third 21-23.
