This Python handler for the "mkdocstrings" package uses PyTkDocs
(= textproc/py-pytkdocs) to collect documentation from Python source code.

Features:

* Data collection from source code: collection of the object-tree and the
  docstrings is done thanks to pytkdocs.

* Support for type annotations: pytkdocs collects your type annotations and
  mkdocstrings uses them to display parameters types or return types.

* Recursive documentation of Python objects: just use the module dotted-path as
  identifier, and you get the full module docs. You don't need to inject
  documentation for each class, function, etc.

* Support for documented attributes: attributes (variables) followed by a
  docstring (triple-quoted string) will be recognized by Griffe in modules,
  classes and even in __init__ methods.

* Multiple docstring-styles support: common support for Google-style,
  Numpydoc-style, and Sphinx-style docstrings.
