This module is built on Text::Aspell, but adds some of the
functionality provided by the internal gnu aspell API. This allows
one to deal with blocks of text, rather than just words. For
instance, we provide methods for iterating through the text,
serializing the object (thus remembering where we left off), and
highlighting the current misspelled word within the text.
