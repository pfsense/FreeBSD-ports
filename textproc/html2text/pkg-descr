html2text is  a command  line utility, written  in C++,  that converts
HTML documents (HTML 3.2) into plain text (ISO 8859-1).

Each HTML  document is loaded from  a location indicated by  an URI or
read from  standard input, and formatted  into a stream of  plain text
characters that is written to  standard output or into an output-file.
The input-URI may  specify a remote site, from that  the documents are
loaded with  the Hypertext  Transfer Protocol  (HTTP). The  program is
even  able to  preserve the  original  positions of  table fields  and
accepts also syntactically incorrect input, attempting to interpret it
"reasonably".  The rendering  is  largely customisable  through an  RC
file.
