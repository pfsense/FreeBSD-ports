The NTC templates project provides a large collection of TextFSM Templates
(text parsers) for a variety of Networking Vendors.

In addition to the templates, there is a function that will convert the CLI
output into a CliTable object; the resulting text table is converted into a
list of dictionaries mapping the column headers with each row in the table.
