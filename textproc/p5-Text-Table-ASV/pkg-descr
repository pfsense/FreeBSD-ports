Text::Table::ASV provides a single function, table, which formats a
two-dimensional array of data as ASV. This is basically a way to generate ASV
using the same interface as that of Text::Table::Tiny (v0.03) or
Text::Table::Org.

ASV (ASCII separated values, also sometimes DEL a.k.a. Delimited ASCII) is a
format similar to TSV (tab separated values). Instead of Tab character ("\t") as
the field separator, ASV uses "\x1f" (ASCII Unit Separator character) and
instead of newline ("\n") as the record separator, ASV uses "\x1e" (ASCII Record
Separator). There is currently no quoting or escaping mechanism provided.
"\x1c", "\x1d", "\x1e", and "\x1f" characters in cell will be replaced by
spaces.
