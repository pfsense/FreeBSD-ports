FoLiA is an XML-based annotation format, suitable for the representation of
linguistically annotated language resources. FoLiA's intended use is as a format
for storing and/or exchanging language resources, including corpora. Our aim is
to introduce a single rich format that can accomodate a wide variety of
linguistic annotation types through a single generalised paradigm. We do not
commit to any label set, language or linguistic theory. This is always left to
the developer of the language resource, and provides maximum flexibility.
