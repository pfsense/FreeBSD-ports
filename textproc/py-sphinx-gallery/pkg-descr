Sphinx-Gallery is a Sphinx extension that builds an HTML gallery of examples
from any set of Python scripts.

Features:
- Create example galleries automatically by running pure Python example scripts
  while capturing outputs + figures, rendering them into reST files built into
  your documentation by Sphinx
- Embed reST in your example Python files, allowing you to interweave
  narrative-like content with code that generates plots in your documentation.
  Sphinx-Gallery also automatically generates a Jupyter Notebook for each your
  example page.
- Add mini-galleries for API documentation. Sphinx-Gallery can generate
  mini-galleries listing all examples that use a particular function/method/etc.
- Add intersphinx links to your examples. Sphinx-Gallery can automatically add
  links to API documentation for functions/methods/classes that are used in your
  examples (for any Python module that uses intersphinx).
- Manage multiple galleries to create and embed galleries for several folders of
  examples.
