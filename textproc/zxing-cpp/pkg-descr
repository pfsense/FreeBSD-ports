ZXing-C++ ("zebra crossing") is an open-source, multi-format
linear/matrix barcode image processing library implemented in C++.

It was originally ported from the Java ZXing Library, but has been
developed further and now includes many improvements in terms of runtime
and detection performance. It can both read and write barcodes in a
number of formats.
