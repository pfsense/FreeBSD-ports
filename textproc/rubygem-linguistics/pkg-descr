This is a generic, language-neutral framework for extending
Ruby objects with linguistic methods.

It includes an English-language module with inflection,
pluralisation, conjunctions, indefinite articles, present
participles, ordinal numbers, numbers to words, general
quantification, integration with WordNet and CMU's LinkGrammar,
as well as a framework for providing modules for other languages.
