This module implements a parser to convert Pod documents into a simple
object model form known hereafter as the Pod Object Model.  The object
model is generated as a hierarchical tree of nodes, each of which
represents a different element of the original document.  The tree can
be walked manually and the nodes examined, printed or otherwise
manipulated.  In addition, Pod::POM supports and provides view objects
which can automatically traverse the tree, or section thereof, and
generate an output representation in one form or another.
