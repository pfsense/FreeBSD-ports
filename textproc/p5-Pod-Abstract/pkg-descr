POD::Abstract provides a means to load a POD (or POD compatible)
document without direct reference to it's syntax, and perform
manipulations on the abstract syntax tree.

This can be used to support additional features for POD, to format
output, to compile into alternative formats, etc.

While Pod looks like a simple format, the specification calls for
a number of special cases to be handled, and that makes any software
that works on Pod as text more complex than it needs to be.  In
addition to this, Pod does not lend itself to a natural structured
model. This makes it difficult to manipulate without damaging the
validity of the document.

Pod::Abstract solves these problems by loading the document into a
structured tree, and providing consistent traversal, searching,
manpulation and re-serialisation. Pod related utilities are easy
to write using Pod::Abstract.
