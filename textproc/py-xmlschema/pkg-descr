The xmlschema library is an implementation of XML Schema for Python (supports
Python 3.6+).

This library arises from the needs of a solid Python layer for processing XML
Schema based files for MaX (Materials design at the Exascale) European project.
A significant problem is the encoding and the decoding of the XML data files
produced by different simulation software. Another important requirement is the
XML data validation, in order to put the produced data under control. The lack
of a suitable alternative for Python in the schema-based decoding of XML data
has led to build this library. Obviously this library can be useful for other
cases related to XML Schema based processing, not only for the original scope.
