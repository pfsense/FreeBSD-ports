Data::Report is a flexible, plugin-driven reporting framework.

The Data::Report framework consists of three parts:

- the plugins

Plugins implement a specific type of report. Standard plugins provided
are Data::Report::Plugin::Text for textual reports,
Data::Report::Plugin::Html for HTML reports, and
Data::Report::Plugin::Csv for CSV (comma-separated) files.

- the base class

The base class Data::Report::Base implements the functionality common to
all reporters, plus a number of utility functions the plugins can use.

- the factory

The actual Data::Report module is a factory that creates a reporter for
a given report type by selecting the appropriate plugin and returning an
instance thereof.
