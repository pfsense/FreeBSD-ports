The Xerces Java Parser is a complete implementation of the parser related
portions of JAXP 1.4 and also brings Xerces into compliance with SAX 2.0.2, the
DOM Level 3 Core and Load/Save W3C Recommendations, the XML Inclusions
(XInclude) Version 1.0 W3C Recommendation and the XML Schema 1.0 Structures and
Datatypes Second Edition W3C Recommendations.

Xerces2 is the next generation of high performance, fully compliant XML parsers
in the Apache Xerces family. This version of Xerces introduces the Xerces
Native Interface (XNI), a complete framework for building parser components and
configurations that is extremely modular and easy to program.

The Apache Xerces2 parser is the reference implementation of XNI but other
parser components, configurations, and parsers can be written using the Xerces
Native Interface.
