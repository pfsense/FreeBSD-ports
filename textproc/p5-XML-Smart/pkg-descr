This module has an easy way to access/create XML data. It's based on the HASH
tree that is made of the XML data, and enable a dynamic access to it with the
Perl syntax for Hashe and Array, without needing to care if you have a Hashe or
an Array in the tree. In other words, each point in the tree work as a Hash and
an Array at the same time!

The module alson handle automatically binary data (encoding/decoding to/from
base64), CDATA (like contents with <tags>) and Unicode.  It can be used to
create XML files, load XML from the Web (just pasting an URL as a file path)
and it has an easy way to send XML data through socket, just adding the length
of the data in the <?xml?> header.

You can use XML::Smart with XML::Parser, or with the 2 standart parsers of
XML::Smart:
