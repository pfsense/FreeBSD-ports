Parse, aggregate, sum, average, min/max, percentile, and sort your data. You
can see it, live-updating, in your terminal. Angle grinder is designed for
when, for whatever reason, you don't have your data in
graphite/honeycomb/kibana/sumologic/splunk/etc. but still want to be able to
do sophisticated analytics.

Angle grinder can process well above 1M rows per second (simple pipelines as
high as 5M), so it's usable for fairly meaty aggregation. The results will live
update in your terminal as data is processed. Angle grinder is a bare bones
functional programming language coupled with a pretty terminal UI.
