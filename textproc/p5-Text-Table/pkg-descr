Organization of data in table form is a time-honored and useful method
of data representation. While columns of data are trivially generated
by computer through formatted output, even simple tasks like keeping
titles aligned with the data columns are not trivial, and the one-shot
solutions one comes up with tend to be particularly hard to maintain.
Text::Table allows you to create and maintain tables that adapt to
alignment requirements as you use them.
