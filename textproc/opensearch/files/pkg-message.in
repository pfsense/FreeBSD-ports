Please see %%ETCDIR%% for a sample version of
opensearch.yml.

OpenSearch requires memory locking of large amounts of RAM.
You may need to set:

sysctl security.bsd.unprivileged_mlock=1

When running within a jail, it's highly advisable to set:

enforce_statfs = 1

for the jail running opensearch instance.

If OpenSearch was built with the PLUGINS option enabled (default) it will not
start until the security plugin is properly configured.  Please refer to the
OpenSearch documentation for setting-up TLS:
