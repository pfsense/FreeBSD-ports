This module provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
module/classes that implement trees.

In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to
mimick DOM nodes. The degree of similitude between the user tree and a
DOM dictates how much of the XPath features can be used. A module
implementing all of the DOM should be able to use this module very
easily (you might need to add the cmp method on nodes in order to get
ordered result sets).

This code is a more or less direct copy of the XML::XPath module by
Matt Sergeant. I only removed the XML processing part to remove the
dependency on XML::Parser, applied a couple of patches, renamed a
whole lot of methods to make Pod::Coverage happy, and changed the docs.
