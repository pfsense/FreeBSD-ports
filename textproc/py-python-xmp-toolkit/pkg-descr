Python XMP Toolkit is a library for working with XMP (= Extensible Metadata
Platform) metadata, as well as reading/writing XMP metadata stored in many
different file formats.

Python XMP Toolkit is wrapping Exempi (using ctypes), a C/C++ XMP library
based on Adobe XMP Toolkit, ensuring that future updates to the XMP standard
are easily incorporated into the library with a minimum amount of work.

Python XMP Toolkit has been developed by:
* ESA/Hubble - European Space Agency
* ESO - European Southern Observatory
* CRS4 - Centre for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia
