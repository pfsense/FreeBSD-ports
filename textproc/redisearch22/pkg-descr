RediSearch is a source available Full-Text and Secondary Index
engine over Redis, developed by Redis Labs.

Redisearch implements a search engine on top of Redis, but
unlike other Redis search libraries, it does not use internal
data structures like sorted sets.

This also enables more advanced features, like exact phrase
matching and numeric filtering for text queries, that are not
possible or efficient with traditional Redis search approaches.
