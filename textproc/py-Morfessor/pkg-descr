The goal of the Morpho project is to develop unsupervised data-driven methods
that discover the regularities behind word forming in natural languages. In
particular, we are focussing on the discovery of morphemes, which are the
primitive units of syntax, the smallest individually meaningful elements in the
utterances of a language. Morphemes are important in automatic generation and
recognition of a language, especially in languages in which words may have many
different inflected forms.
