File::Inplace is a Perl module intended to ease the common task of
editing a file in-place. Inspired by variations of Perl's -i option,
this module is intended for somewhat more structured and reusable
editing than command line Perl typically allows.

File::Inplace endeavors to guarantee file integrity; that is, either
all of the changes made will be saved to the file, or none will.
It also offers functionality such as backup creation, automatic
field splitting per-line, automatic chomping/unchomping, and aborting
edits partially through without affecting the original file.
