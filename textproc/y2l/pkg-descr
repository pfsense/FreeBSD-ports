The Yacc to LaTeX utility takes (hopefully) any yacc source file,
and derives an Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) description from
it. This EBNF is written out as LaTeX source. The output is a LaTeX
"longtable" environment, that can be included in any LaTeX document,
typically using an \input{} statement.
