Aiksaurus is a set of libraries and applications which provide a thesaurus
(currently English only, based on Guttenburg's Moby thesaurus) using native
GUI on several platforms: UNIX (GTK+ & Qt), Win32 & MacOSX (Cocoa). The core
library itself is platform-independent. The principal language is C++, with
some use of Cocoa/ObjC++; wrappers are provided for C and Cocoa/ObjC.

Aiksausus plugins exist for AbiWord on UNIX and Win32; the library is also
used by Lyx; and the new Cocoa port provides a MacOSX NSService hook so that
Safari and other such applications can use this thesaurus without
Aiksaurus-specific development.
