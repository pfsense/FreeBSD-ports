The bibutils program set interconverts between various bibliography formats
using a common MODS-format XML intermediate. For example, one can convert
RIS-format files to Bibtex by doing two transformations: RIS->MODS->Bibtex. By
using a common intermediate for N formats, only 2N programs are required and not
N^2-N. These programs operate on the command line and are styled after standard
UNIX-like filters.
