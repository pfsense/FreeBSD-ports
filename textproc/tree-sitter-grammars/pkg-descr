Collection of tree-sitter grammars

Language support such as tokenizing and highlighting is provided by Tree-sitter.
Each language requires a Tree-sitter grammar to have tokenization and queries
to provide additional features such as syntax highlighting.

Lapce has select few (Rust, JSON, TOML) grammars built-in for convenience.
All other languages need to provide an externally loadable grammar in a form of
shared library, which this port provides.
