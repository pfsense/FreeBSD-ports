The SAXON package is a collection of tools for processing XML
documents. The main components are:

  - An XSLT processor, which implements the Version 1.0 XSLT and XPath
    Recommendations with a number of powerful extensions.

  - A Java library, which supports a similar processing model to XSL,
    but allows full programming capability.

  - A slightly improved version of the Alfred parser from Microstar.
