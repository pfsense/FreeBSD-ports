sift has a slightly different focus than most other grep alternatives. Code
search, log search / digital forensics and data processing are the main use
cases, but the primary goal is to provide safe defaults and to make it easily
configurable for a specific use case. Among the features are:
- Stable releases, cross platform support
- Safe defaults: sift searches everywhere if not configured otherwise
- Complete & working .gitignore support
- High performance for many uses cases
- Support for adding custom file types to narrow down searches
- Multiline support
- Support for big files: >50GB, >5,000,000,000 lines and >5,000,000,000 matches
