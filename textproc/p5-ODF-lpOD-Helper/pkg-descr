ODF::lpOD_Helper enables transparent Unicode support, provides
higher-level multi-segment text search & replace methods, and
works around ODF::lpOD bugs and limitations.

Styles may be specified with a high-level notation and the necessary
span and style objects are automatically created and fonts registered.
