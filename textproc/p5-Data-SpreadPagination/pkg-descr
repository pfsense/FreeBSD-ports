Perl module for page numbering and spread pagination. The object produced by
Data::SpreadPagination can be used to create an easy to use spread pagination
navigator. It inherits from Data::Page, and in addition provides methods to
create a pagination spread, keeping pagenumbers displayed within a sensible
limit.
