This is a keyboard for input of the standardized Yi script of southwestern
China with Unicode Yi fonts. It is written in Keyman keyboard language and
developed by SIL Non-Roman Script Initiative (NRSI).

This port installs the keyboard so that it can be used through SCIM or
IBus KMFL IMEngine (textproc/scim-kmfl-imengine, textproc/ibus-kmfl).

To keyboard a Yi syllable, you should type the Pinyin romanization for that
syllable, followed by a space. For keyboarding punctuation, use the usual
punctuation keystrokes.

The keyboard is compatible with Yi range as defined in Unicode 3.0 and it does
not provide keystrokes for the Yi Radicals which were added to Unicode 3.2
(U+A4A2..U+A4A3, U+A4B4, U+A4C1, U+A4C5).
