write-good is a naive linter for English prose. For example,
it is able to check for the following issues in text:

- passive voice
- lexical illusions -- cases where a word is repeated
- "so" at the beginning of the sentence
- "there is" or "there are" at the beginning of the sentence
- weasel words
- adverbs that can weaken meaning: really, very, extremely, etc.
- wordy phrases and unnecessary words
- common cliches
