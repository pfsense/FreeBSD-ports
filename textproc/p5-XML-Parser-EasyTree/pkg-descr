XML::Parser::EasyTree adds a new "built-in" style called "EasyTree" to
XML::Parser. Like XML::Parser's "Tree" style, setting this style causes the
parser to build a lightweight tree structure representing the XML document.
This structure is, at least in this author's opinion, easier to work with than
the one created by the built-in style.
