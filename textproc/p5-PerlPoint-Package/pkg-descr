PerlPoint is both a presentation and a documentation toolset. More precise, its
a toolset to generate presentations and documentations. You will write a simple
text and start a converter to make the final documents from this source. The
final format is your choice, depending on the used converter. So you can make a
presentation, speaker notes, handouts, an internet documentation and a brochure
all from the same text source, but looking very individual.

Because of this two step architecture PerlPoint authors deal both with the text
format and several converters. The text source describes structure and contents
of your document, while a converter adds layout. Let's start.
