The HTML::Fraction encodes fractions as HTML entities. Some very common
fractions have HTML entities (eg 1/2 is &frac12;). Additionally, common
vulgar fractions have Unicode characters (eg 1/5 is &#8533;). This
module takes a string and encodes fractions as entities: this means that
it will look pretty in the browser.
