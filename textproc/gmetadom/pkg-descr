GMetaDOM is a collection of librares, each library providing a DOM
implementation. Currently available bindings are for C++ (smart pointers)
and Objective Caml.

The basic idea is that, given the availability of DOM implementations for
the C programming language (like Gdome2), and given the uniformity of the
DOM interfaces, bindings for various programming languages based on the C
implementation can be built automatically, providing a small number of hand-
coded classes and a set of scripts for the automatic generation of the
remaining ones.

The advantages of such approach should be evident. In particular, for
languages like C++ where a number of different alternative DOM implementations
are feasible, each with different characteristics like easiness of use,
runtime flexibility, resource requirements, the approach of automatic
generation permits to create a set of coherent implementations addressing
such issues separately, ultimately allowing the developer to choose the
library which fits best her needs.
