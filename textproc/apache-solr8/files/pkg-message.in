Make sure to edit the following files to adapt to your setup:

%%LOCALBASE%%/etc/solr.in.sh
/var/db/solr/solr.xml

All files are configured to have your solr instances running in
/var/db/solr/<instancename>

For more information how to configure solr check the manual:
http://lucene.apache.org/solr/resources.html#documentation

The port is configured to listen only on localhost, port 8983.

To have a working initial config, use:

cp -R %%LOCALBASE%%/solr/example/example-DIH/solr/solr /var/db/solr/
chown -R solr /var/db/solr/solr

To rotate solr log files include /var/log/solr/ to your log rotation
configuration.

To enable the port execute:
sysrc solr_enable="YES"

And start it with:
service solr start
