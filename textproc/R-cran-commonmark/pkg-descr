The CommonMark specification defines a rationalized version of
markdown syntax. This package uses the 'cmark' reference implementation
for converting markdown text into various formats including html,
latex and groff man. In addition it exposes the markdown parse tree
in xml format. Also includes opt-in support for GFM extensions
including tables, autolinks, and strikethrough text.
