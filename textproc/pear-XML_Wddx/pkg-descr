PEAR::XML_Wddx does 2 things:
a) a drop in replacement for the XML_Wddx extension (if it's not built in)
b) produce an editable wddx file (with indenting etc.) and uses CDATA, rather
   than char tags

This package contains 2 static methods:
XML_Wddx:serialize($value)
XML_Wddx:deserialize($value)

Should be 90% compatible with wddx_deserialize(), and the deserializer will
use wddx_deserialize if it is built in.

No support for recordsets is available at present in the PHP version of the
deserializer.
