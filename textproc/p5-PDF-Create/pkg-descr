From the p5-PDF-Create README:

	PDF::Create allows you to create PDF documents using a large
	number of primitives, and emit the result as a PDF file or
	stream. PDF stands for Portable Document Format.

	Documents can have several pages, a table of content, an
	information section and many other PDF elements. More
	functionnalities will be added as needs arise.

For more details, type 'perldoc PDF::Create' or see the CPAN homepage:
