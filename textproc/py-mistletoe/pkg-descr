mistletoe is a Markdown parser in pure Python, designed to be fast,
spec-compliant and fully customizable.

Apart from being the fastest CommonMark-compliant Markdown parser implementation
in pure Python, mistletoe also supports easy definitions of custom tokens.
Parsing Markdown into an abstract syntax tree also allows us to swap out
renderers for different output formats, without touching any of the core
components.

Remember to spell mistletoe in lowercase!
