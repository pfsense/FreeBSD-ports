This provides a simple interface to Plucene. Plucene is large and multi-
featured, and it expected that users will subclass it, and tie all the
pieces together to suit their own needs. Plucene::Simple is, therefore,
just one way to use Plucene. It's not expected that it will do exactly
what *you* want, but you can always use it as an example of how to
build your own interface.
