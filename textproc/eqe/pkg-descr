Eqe is a simple clone of the excellent LaTeX equation editor you can find on
MacOS X. There's a zone to type LaTeX input, and it generates an image to
represent it (color, font, and size are customisable). You can drag the
image to other applications (like OpenOffice.org Impress, Mozilla, the
Gimp). It also exports to almost any image format, including PNG, JPEG,
PDF...). It is free software, released under the GPL.

It is composed of two parts: eqedit, which is a command line tool that
generates images from LaTeX input, and eqe which wraps eqedit into a
graphical user interface.
