Jarnal is an open-source application for notetaking, sketching, keeping a
journal, making a presentation, annotating a document - including pdf - or
collaborating using a stylus, mouse or keyboard. It is similar to Microsoft
Windows Journal and to the earlier Mimeo whiteboarding and Palm notepad
applications.
