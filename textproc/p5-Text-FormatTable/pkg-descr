Text::FormatTable renders simple tables as text. You pass to the constructor
(new) a table format specification similar to LaTeX (e.g. r|l|5l|R|20L) and you
call methods to fill the table data and insert rules. After the data is filled,
you call the render method and the table gets formatted as text.
