This Python handler for the "mkdocstrings" package uses Griffe
(= textproc/py-griffe) to collect documentation from Python source code.

Features:

* Data collection from source code: collection of the object-tree and the
  docstrings is done thanks to Griffe.

* Support for type annotations: Griffe collects your type annotations and
  mkdocstrings uses them to display parameter types or return types.

* Recursive documentation of Python objects: just use the module dotted-path as
  an identifier, and you get the full module docs. You don't need to inject
  documentation for each class, function, etc.

* Support for documented attributes: attributes (variables) followed by a
  docstring (triple-quoted string) will be recognized by Griffe in modules,
  classes and even in __init__ methods.

* Multiple docstring-styles support: common support for Google-style,
  Numpydoc-style, and Sphinx-style docstrings. See Griffe's documentation on
  docstrings support.
