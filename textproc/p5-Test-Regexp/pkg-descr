This module is intended to test your regular expressions.

Given a subject string and a regular expression (aka pattern), the module not
only tests whether the regular expression complete matches the subject string,
it performs a utf8::upgrade or utf8::downgrade on the subject string and
performs the tests again, if necessary.

Furthermore, given a pattern with capturing parenthesis, it checks whether all
captures are present, and in the right order. Both named and unnamed captures
are checked.
