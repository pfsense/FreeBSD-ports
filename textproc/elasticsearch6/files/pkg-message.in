Please see %%ETCDIR%% for sample versions of
elasticsearch.yml and logging.yml.

ElasticSearch requires memory locking of large amounts of RAM.
You may need to set:

sysctl security.bsd.unprivileged_mlock=1

!!! PLUGINS NOTICE !!!

ElasticSearch plugins should only be installed via the elasticsearch-plugin
included with this software. As we strive to provide a minimum semblance
of security, the files installed by the package are owned by root:wheel.
This is different than upstream which expects all of the files to be
owned by the user and for you to execute the elasticsearch-plugin script
as said user.

You will encounter permissions errors with configuration files and
directories created by plugins which you will have to manually correct.
This is the price we have to pay to protect ourselves in the face of
a poorly designed security model.

e.g., after installing X-Pack you will have to correct:

%%ETCDIR%%/elasticsearch.keystore file to be owned by elasticsearch:elasticsearch
%%ETCDIR%%/x-pack directory/files to be owned by elasticsearch:elasticsearch
