We fathom PDF

Pdfminer.six is a community maintained fork of the original PDFMiner. It is a
tool for extracting information from PDF documents. It focuses on getting and
analyzing text data. Pdfminer.six extracts the text from a page directly from
the sourcecode of the PDF. It can also be used to get the exact location, font
or color of the text.

It is built in a modular way such that each component of pdfminer.six can be
replaced easily. You can implement your own interpreter or rendering device
that uses the power of pdfminer.six for other purposes than text analysis.
