parse_type extends the parse module (opposite of string.format()) with the
following features:
- build type converters for common use cases (enum/mapping, choice)
- build a type converter with a cardinality constraint (0..1, 0..*, 1..*)
  from the type converter with cardinality=1.
- compose a type converter from other type converters
- an extended parser that supports the CardinalityField naming schema
  and creates missing type variants (0..1, 0..*, 1..*) from the primary type
  converter
