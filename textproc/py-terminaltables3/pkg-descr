Easily draw tables in terminal/console applications from a list of
lists of strings. Supports multi-line rows.

This is a fork of the terminaltables project. Which is archived and
unmaintained. This library is in a new namespace but should otherwise
be a drop in replacement. Maintaining goals consist of maintaining
ecosystem compatibility, type annotations and responding to community
pull requests.
