This module allows you to extract Hatena keywords used in an
arbitrary text and also allows you to mark up a text as HTML
with the keywords.

A Hatena keyword is an element in a suite of web sites
*.hatena.ne.jp having blogs and social bookmarks among others.
Please refer to http://d.hatena.ne.jp/keyword/ (in Japanese) for details.

In Hatena Diary, a blog hosting service, a Hatena keyword found in
a posting is linked to the keywords page automatically.
You can implement the same kind of feature outside Hatena using this module.

It queries Hatena Keyword Link API internally for retrieving terms
