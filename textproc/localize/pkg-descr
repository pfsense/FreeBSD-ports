Localize is an application to aid in the translation of .strings files.
.strings files must be distributed in ASCII encoding, which generally
isn't a convenient encoding to do translation in. As an example, its rather
difficult to enter Chinese characters into an ASCII encoded text file.
Localize will, with any luck, help out with this. Currently its just a
shell of an application, but sometime in the future I hope to complete it.
