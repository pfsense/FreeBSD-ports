Python-Markdown is a Python implementation of John Gruber's Markdown. It is
almost completely compliant with the reference implementation, though there are
a few known issues.

In addition to the basic markdown syntax, Python-Markdown supports the following
features:
- International Input: Python-Markdown will accept input in any language
  supported by Unicode including bi-directional text. In fact the test suite
  includes documents written in Russian and Arabic.
- Extensions: Various extensions are provided (including extra) to change and/or
  extend the base syntax. Additionally, a public Extension API is available to
  write your own extensions.
- Output Formats: Python-Markdown can output documents with either HTML or XHTML
  style tags. See the Library Reference for details.
- Command Line Interface: In addition to being a Python Library, a command line
  script is available for your convenience.
