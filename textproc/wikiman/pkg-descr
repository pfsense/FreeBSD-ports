Wikiman is an offline search engine for manual pages, Arch Wiki, Gentoo Wiki and
other documentation.

Wikiman provides an easy interface for browsing documentation without the need
to be exact and connected to the internet. This is achieved by utilizing full
text search for wikis, partial name and description matching for man pages,
and fuzzy filtering for search results.
