dyff is a diff tool for YAML files (and occasionally JSON), designed to
show only meaningful differences in a human-readable format. It is
inspired by the way BOSH v1 displayed configuration changes, using
syntax styles from Spruce and go-patch to locate differences within the
document structure.

dyff supports comparing local or remote files, integrates with kubectl
and Git for improved YAML diffing workflows, and includes utilities to
restructure, pretty-print, and convert between YAML and JSON.
