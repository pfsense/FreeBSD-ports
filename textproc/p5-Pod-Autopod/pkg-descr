Pod::Autopod is designed to generate pod documentation of a perl
class by analysing its code. The idea is to have something similar
like javadoc. So it uses also comments written directly obove the
method definitions. It is designed to asumes a pm file which
represents a class.

Of course it cannot understand every kind of syntax, parameters,
etc. But the plan is to improve this library in the future to
understand more and more automatically.
