Text::ANSITable is yet another text table formatter module like Text::ASCIITable
or Text::SimpleTable, with the following differences:
- Colors and color themes: ANSI color codes will be used by default (even 256
  and 24bit colors), but will degrade to lower color depth and black/white
  according to terminal support.
- Box-drawing characters: Box-drawing characters will be used by default, but
  will degrade to using normal ASCII characters if terminal does not support them.
- Unicode and wide character support: Border styles using Unicode characters
  (double lines, bold/heavy lines, brick style, etc). Columns containing wide
  characters stay aligned. (Note: support for wide characters requires
  Text::ANSI::WideUtil which is currently set as an optional prereq, so you'll
  need to install it explicitly or set your CPAN client to install 'recommends'
  prereq).

Compared to Text::ASCIITable, it uses lower_case method/attr names instead of
CamelCase, and it uses arrayref for columns and add_row. When specifying border
styles, the order of characters are slightly different. More fine-grained
options to customize appearance.
