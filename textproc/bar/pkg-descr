This is a small shell script intended to be used in portable Unix install
scripts for showing progress bars.

The overall goal is to write a minimally complex shell script (thus a program
that needs no compilation) that is as robust as possible to work on as many
Bourne shells and operating systems as possible, and that implements 'cat'
with an ASCII progress bar and some other nifty features.

This is pure Bourne shell code. (For sh, ash, ksh, zsh, bash, ...)

The script is mainly indented to be used in portable install scripts, where
you can use the body of the script.
