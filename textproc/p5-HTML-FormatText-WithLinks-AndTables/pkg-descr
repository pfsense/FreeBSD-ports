This module was inspired by HTML::FormatText::WithLinks which has proven to be
a useful `lynx -dump` work-alike. The aim was to provide facility to take a
simple HTML based email template, and to also convert it to text with the
<TABLE> structure intact for inclusion as "multipart/alternative" content.
Further, it will preserve both the formatting specified by the <TD> tag's
"align" attribute, and will also preserve multiline text inside of a <TD>
element provided it is broken using <BR/> tags.
