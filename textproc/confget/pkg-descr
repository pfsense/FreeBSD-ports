The confget utility examines a INI-style configuration file and retrieves
the value of the specified variables from the specified section.
Its intended use is to let shell scripts use the same INI-style
configuration files as other programs, to avoid duplication of data.

The confget utility may retrieve the values of one or more variables,
list all the variables in a specified section, list only those whose names
or values match a specified pattern (shell glob or regular expression), or
check if a variable is present in the file at all.  It has a "shell-quoting"
output mode that quotes the variable values in a way suitable for passing
them directly to a Bourne-style shell.
