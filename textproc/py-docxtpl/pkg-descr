python-docx-template has been created because python-docx is powerful for
creating documents but not for modifying them.

The idea is to begin to create an example of the document you want to generate
with microsoft word, it can be as complex as you want: pictures, index tables,
footer, header, variables, anything you can do with word. Then, as you are
still editing the document with microsoft word, you insert jinja2-like tags
directly in the document. You save the document as a .docx file (xml format).
it will be your .docx template file.

Now you can use python-docx-template to generate as many word documents you
want from this .docx template and context variables you will associate.
