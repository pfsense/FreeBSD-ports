Text::Balanced - Extract delimited text sequences from strings.

The various extract_... subroutines may be used to extract a delimited
string (possibly after skipping a specified prefix string).  The search
for the string always begins at the current pos location of the string's
variable (or at index zero, if no pos position is defined).
