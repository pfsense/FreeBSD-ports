rstfmt is a tool for automatically formatting reStructuredText files in a
consistent way.

Like Black and gofmt, the motivation is to provide a format that is reasonable
and minimally configurable to prevent teams from wasting time on style
discussions (or individuals on manually doing formatting, for that matter).

Currently, rstfmt is in a very early stage of development. Not all reST
constructs are covered and the interface or formatting may change at any time
without warning.
