Ingest EVTX files into a Splunk instance.

This tool is based on the work of :

Omer BenAmram
Blardy
Thanks to Ekto for its contribution.

Key features:

- Splunk HEC support with token auto-creation
- Splunk index auto-creation
- Multiprocessing support
- Caching for evtx reuse without reconverting
- Windows and Linux compatibility
- Rely on the great and fast evtx_dump Rust tool of Omer
- Evtx message resolutions from database

Note: evtx2splunk converts the EVTX to JSON and stores them in a temporary
place. Hence, up to the size of source EVTX can be created during the process.
These files are removed at the end of the process, except if keep_cache is
enabled.
