aeidon is a Python package for reading, writing and manipulating text-based
subtitle files. It is used by the gaupol package, which provides a subtitle
editor with a GTK user interface.

Separating a user interface independent general-purpose subtitle editing package
from Gaupol has been an afterthought and thus not well designed to be a reusable
component, but on the other hand is proven, working and maintained code.
