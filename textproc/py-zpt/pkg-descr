Zope Page Templates is a Python package that implements Page Templates like
in Zope, but works outside of Zope.  In fact, you don't need to install any
part of Zope to use them.  This means that you can use the elegance and ease
of page templates in your own web applications, reporting frameworks,
documentation systems, etc.
