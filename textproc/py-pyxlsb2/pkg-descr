pyxlsb2 (a variant of pyxlsb) is an Excel 2007+ Binary Workbook (xlsb) parser
written in Python.

pyxslb2 offers the following improvements/changes in comparison to pyxlsb:
- By default, keeps all data in memory instead of creating temporary files. This
  is mainly to speed up the processing and also not changing the local file
  system during the processing.
- relies on both "xl\workbook.bin" and "xl\_rels\workbook.bin.rels" to load
  locate boundsheets. As a result, it can load all worksheets as well as all
  macrosheets.
- extracts macro formulas:
  - accurately shows the formulas
  - supports A1 addressing
  - supports external addressing (partially implemented))
- extracts defined names such as auto_open
