The Text::Striphigh module exports a single function: C<striphigh>. This
function takes one argument, a string possibly containing high ASCII
characters in the ISO-8859-1 character set, and transforms this into a
string containing only 7 bits ASCII characters, by substituting every
high bit character with a similar looking standard ASCII character, or
with a sequence of standard ASCII characters.

Because of precisely the deficiency this package tries to offer a workaround
for is present in some of the things that process pod, there are no
examples in this manpage. Look at the source or the test script if you
want examples.
