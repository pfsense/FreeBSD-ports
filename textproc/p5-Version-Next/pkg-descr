This module provides a simple, correct way to increment a Perl module version
number.  It does not attempt to guess what the original version number author
intended, it simply increments in the smallest possible fashion.  Decimals are
incremented like an odometer.  Dotted decimals are incremented piecewise and
presented in a standardized way.
