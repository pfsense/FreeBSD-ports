This keyboard is designed to enable simple input in all European
languages which use Latin-script, and in most Latin-script languages
from the rest of the world.

The keyboard is written in KMN Keyboard Language by the KMN language
developer, Tavultesoft (http://www.tavultesoft.com). The keyboard
uses punctuation and letter keys in sequence to access diacritic and
other letters.

This port installs the keyboard so that it can be used through SCIM or
IBus KMFL IMEngine (textproc/scim-kmfl-imengine, textproc/ibus-kmfl).

It currently covers 120 languages including: Afrikaans, Albanian,
Balearic, Basque, Breton, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch,
Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Finnish, French, Gaelic, Galician,
German, Hungarian, Icelandic, Inuktitut, Italian, Kashubian, Ladin,
Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Norwegian, Nynorsk, Polish, Portugese,
Romansch, Saami, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Sorbian, Spanish,
