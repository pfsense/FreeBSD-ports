zen::Xml is an XML library serializing structured user data in a convenient way.
Using compile-time information gathered by techniques of template
metaprogramming it minimizes the manual overhead required and frees the user
from implementing fundamental type conversions by himself.

zen::Xml is written in a platform independent manner and runs on any
C++14-compliant compiler.
