collective.checkdocs adds new distutils commands checkdocs and showdocs to
validate restructured text in long_description field of Python eggs. This
package aims to make Python egg help page publishing and editing easier.

Eggs' long description field, which is usually also the README.txt file of
the package, is reST formatted text. This text is converted to HTML to show on
the package page when package is published in distribution repositories like
PyPI or plone.org. Unfortunately, since repositories do poor job to validate
incoming reST text, errors in the text will result to broken published
package pages.

Unpublishing is usually very cumbersome. We save our time by validating reST
input using checkdocs and showdocs commands before submitting eggs to PyPi.
