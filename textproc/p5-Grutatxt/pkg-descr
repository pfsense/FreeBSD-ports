Grutatxt is a plain text to HTML (and other formats) converter. It succesfully
converts subtle text markup of lists, bold, italics, tables and headings to
their corresponding HTML, troff, man page or LaTeX markup without having to
write unreadable source text files. Grutatxt is a Perl module and a command
line utility, and is the main text renderer in the Gruta CMS.

The output drivers currently supported by Grutatxt are: HTML, troff (me
macros), man and LaTeX.
