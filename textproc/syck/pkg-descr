Syck is an extension for reading and writing YAML swiftly in popular
scripting languages. As Syck loads the YAML, it stores the data
directly in your language's symbol table. This means speed. This
means power. This means Do not disturb Syck because it is so focused
on the task at hand that it will slay you mortally if you get in its
way.
