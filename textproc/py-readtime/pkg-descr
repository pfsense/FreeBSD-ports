Calculates the time some text takes the average human to read, based on
Medium's read time forumula.

Medium's Help Center says:

"Read time is based on the average reading speed of an adult (roughly 265 WPM).
 We take the total word count of a post and translate it into minutes, with an
 adjustment made for images. For posts in Chinese, Japanese and Korean, it's a
 function of number of characters (500 characters/min) with an adjustment made
 for images."
