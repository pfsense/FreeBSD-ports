textual-image renders images directly in your terminal using Textual and Rich.

textual-image offers both Rich renderables and Textual Widgets that leverage the
Terminal Graphics Protocol (TGP) and Sixel protocols to display images in your
terminal. For terminals that don't support these protocols, fallback rendering
using Unicode characters is available.

Supported Terminals:
- Terminal Graphics Protocol (TGP): Initially introduced by the Kitty terminal
  emulator. While support is partially available in other terminals, it doesn't
  seem to be really usable there.
- Sixel Graphics: Supported by various terminal emulators including xterm and a
  lot of others.
