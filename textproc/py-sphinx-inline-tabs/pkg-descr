Sphinx Inline Tabs adds inline tabbed content to your Sphinx documentation.

Features:
- Elegant design: Small footprint in the markup and generated website, while
  looking good.
- Configurable: All the colors can be configured using CSS variables.
- Synchronisation: Tabs with the same label all switch with a single click.
- Works without JavaScript: JavaScript is not required for the basics, only for
  synchronisation.
