Template::Tiny is a reimplementation of a partial subset of the Template
Toolkit in as few lines of code as possible.

It is intended for use in light-usage, low-memory, or low-cpu templating
situations, where you may need to upgrade to the full feature set in the
future, or if you want the familiarity of TT-style templates.

It is intended to have fully-compatible template and stash usage, with a
limited by similar Perl API.

Unlike Template Toolkit, Template::Tiny will process templates without a
compile phase (but despite this is still quicker, owing to heavy use of
the Perl regular expression engine.
