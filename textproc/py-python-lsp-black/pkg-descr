Black plugin for the Python LSP Server.

* This plugin will disable the yapf and autopep8 plugins if installed.
* python-lsp-black can either format an entire file or just the selected text.
* The code will only be formatted if it is syntactically valid Python.
* Text selections are treated as if they were a separate Python file.
  Unfortunately this means you can't format an indented block of code.
* python-lsp-black will use your project's pyproject.toml if it has one.
* python-lsp-black only officially supports the latest stable version of
  black. An effort is made to keep backwards-compatibility but older black
  versions will not be actively tested.
* The plugin can cache the black configuration that applies to each Python file,
  this improves performance of the plugin. When configuration caching is
  enabled any changes to black's configuration will need the LSP server to be
  restarted. Configuration caching can be disabled with the cache_config option.
