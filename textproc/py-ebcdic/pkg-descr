ebcdic is a Python package adding additional EBCDIC codecs for data
exchange with legacy system. It works with Python 2.7 and Python
3.4+.

EBCDIC is short for Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code
and is a family of character encodings that is mainly used on
mainframe computers. There is no real point in using it unless you
have to exchange data with legacy systems that still only support
EBCDIC as character encoding.
