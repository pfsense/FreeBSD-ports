lightweight C library that can parse John Gruber's [markdown]
(http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format and convert
it into several formats and can be easily extended.

It also provides two usage examples:
- mkd2html: markdown to xhtml conversion.
- mkd2man: markdown to manpage conversion.
