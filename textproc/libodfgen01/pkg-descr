libodfgen is a library for generating documents in Open Document Format
(ODF).  It provides generator implementation for the following libraries:

* libwpd (::WPXDocumentInterface): text documents
* libwpg (libwpg::WPGPaintInterface): vector drawings
* libetonyek (libetonyek::KEYPresentationInterface): presentations

As these APIs are used by multiple libraries, libodfgen can be used to
generate ODF from many sources.
