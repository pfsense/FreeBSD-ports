This module uses XML::Parser to make XML document trees constructed of
XML::Element objects (and XML::Element is a subclass of HTML::Element
adapted for XML).  XML::TreeBuilder is meant particularly for people
who are used to the HTML::TreeBuilder / HTML::Element interface to
document trees, and who don't want to learn some other document
interface like XML::Twig or XML::DOM.
