API Client library for the Cloud Translation API

Cloud Translation can dynamically translate text between thousands of language
pairs. Translation lets websites and programs programmatically integrate with
the translation service.

Actual client classes for the various versions of this API are defined in
versioned client gems, with names of the form google-cloud-translate-v*. The gem
google-cloud-translate is the main client library that brings the verisoned gems
in as dependencies, and provides high-level methods for constructing clients.
