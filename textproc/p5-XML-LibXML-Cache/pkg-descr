XML::LibXML::Cache is a cache for XML::LibXML documents loaded from files. It is
useful to speed up loading of XML files in persistent web applications.

This module caches the document object after the first load and returns the
cached version on subsequent loads. Documents are reloaded whenever the document
file changes. Changes to other files referenced during parsing also cause a
reload. This includes external DTDs, external entities or XIncludes.
