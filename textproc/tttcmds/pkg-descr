TTT COMMANDS is a development commands set to build information
system that could handle large datasets rapidly and flexibly.
This gives you a way lit power to build a fast process system
without some kind of databases. You would build the data process
system using only TTT COMMANDS, Unix-style basic commands and
text datasets on your own favorite operating systems.
