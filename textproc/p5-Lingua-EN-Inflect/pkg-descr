The exportable subroutines of Lingua::EN::Inflect provide plural
inflections and "a"/"an" selection for English words.

Plural forms of all nouns, most verbs, and some adjectives are
provided. Where appropriate, "classical" variants (for example:
"brother" -> "brethren", "dogma" -> "dogmata", etc.) are also
provided.
