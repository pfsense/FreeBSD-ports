This is a Python module and command line fully compatible with WaveDrom, which
is originally implemented in JavaScript. It is useful if you want to generate
wavedrom diagrams from a Python environment or simply don't want to install the
Node.js environment just to use WaveDrom as simple command line.

WaveDromPy is for example used in sphinxcontrib-wavedrom to render wavedrom for
Sphinx documentation. While the original project renders the diagrams in
JavaScript in the browser, WaveDromPy renders them to SVG files.

This tool is a direct translation of original Javascript file WaveDrom.js to
Python. No extra feature added. We seek to have it fully compatible.

The tool WaveDromPy directly converts WaveDrom compatible JSON files into SVG
format.
