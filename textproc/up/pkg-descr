up is the Ultimate Plumber, a tool for writing Linux pipes in a terminal-based
UI interactively, with instant live preview of command results.

The main goal of the Ultimate Plumber is to help interactively and
incrementally explore textual data in Linux, by making it easier to quickly
build complex pipelines, thanks to a fast feedback loop. This is achieved by
boosting any typical Linux text-processing utils such as grep, sort, cut,
paste, awk, wc, perl, etc., etc., by providing a quick, interactive, scrollable
preview of their results.
