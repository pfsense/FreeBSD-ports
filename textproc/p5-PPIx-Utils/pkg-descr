PPIx::Utils is a collection of utility functions for working with PPI documents.
The functions are organized into submodules, and may be imported from the
appropriate submodule or via this module.

These functions were originally from Perl::Critic::Utils and related modules,
and have been split off to this distribution for use outside of Perl::Critic.
