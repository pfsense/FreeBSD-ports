This module allows you to generates CPAN like pod pages from your
modules (not only perl but also javascript including pod) for your
projects.  Set your library modules' root directory with libroot option.
And you have to set output directory's path with outroot option.  And
this module searches your pm and pod files from your libroot, and
generates html files, and an index page lists up all your modules there.
