sansi was written to strip the ANSI control sequences in files, or
output, often, but not limited to those generated by compilers. I
found it difficult to visually grope/grep the output of script(1)
sessions. Especially with the advent of clang. While it's nice to
replay the script(1) sessions to view the highlighted messages.
It's near impossible to read it inline in your favorite pager, or
text editor;
Enter sansi.
