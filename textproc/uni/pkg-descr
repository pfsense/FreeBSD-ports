uni queries the Unicode database from the commandline.

There are four commands: identify codepoints in a string, search for codepoints,
print codepoints by class, block, or range, and emoji to find emojis.

It includes full support for Unicode 12.1 (May 2019) with full Emoji support (a
surprisingly large amount of emoji pickers don't deal with emoji sequences very
well).
