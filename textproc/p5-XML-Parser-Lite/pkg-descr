This Perl module implements an XML parser with a interface similar to
XML::Parser. Though not all callbacks are supported, you should be able
to use it in the same way you use XML::Parser. Due to using experimental
regexp features it'll work only on Perl 5.6 and above and may behave
differently on different platforms.
Note that you cannot use regular expressions or split in callbacks. This
is due to a limitation of perl's regular expression implementation
(which is not re-entrant).
