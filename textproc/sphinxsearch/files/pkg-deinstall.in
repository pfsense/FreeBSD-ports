The $portname port has been deleted.  If you are not
upgrading and don't intend to use $portname any more
then you may wish to delete the $sphinx_usr account,
and the $sphinx_grp group together with the working
directory $sphinx_dir; which can be done with the
following commands:

    # pw userdel -n $sphinx_usr
    # rm -rf $sphinx_dir
EOMSG
    echo
    ;;
esac

# That's All Folks!
