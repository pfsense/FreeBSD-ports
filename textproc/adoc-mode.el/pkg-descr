adoc-mode is an Emacs major mode for editing AsciiDoc files. It
emphasizes on the idea that the document is highlighted so it pretty
much looks like the final output. What must be bold is bold, what must
be italic is italic etc. Meta characters are naturally still visible,
but in a faint way, so they can be easily ignored.
