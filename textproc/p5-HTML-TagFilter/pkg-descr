HTML::TagFilter is a subclass of HTML::Parser with a single purpose: it
will remove unwanted html tags and attributes from a piece of text. It
can act in a more or less fine-grained way - you can specify permitted
tags, permitted attributes of each tag, and permitted values for each
attribute in as much detail as you like.
