Terminal screenshot tool, which takes the console output and renders an output
image that resembles a user interface window. The idea is similar to what
carbon.now.sh, instaco.de, or codekeep.io/screenshot do. Instead of applying
syntax highlight based on a programming language, termshot is using the ANSI
escape codes of the program output. The result is clean screenshot (or
recreation) of your terminal output. If you want, it has an option to edit the
program output before creating the screenshot. This way you can remove unwanted
sensitive content. Like time, watch, or perf, just place termshot before the
command and you are set.
