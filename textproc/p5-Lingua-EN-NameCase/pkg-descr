Forenames and surnames are often stored either wholly in UPPERCASE
or wholly in lowercase. This module allows you to convert names
into the correct case where possible.

Although forenames and surnames are normally stored separately if
they do appear in a single string, whitespace separated, NameCase
and nc deal correctly with them.
