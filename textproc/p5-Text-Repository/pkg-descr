Text::Repository attempts to simplify storing shared text between
multple Perl modules, scripts, templating systems, etc. It does this by
allowing chunks of text to be stored with symbolic names.
Text::Repository was originally designed to store SQL queries, but can
of course be used with any kind of text that needs to be shared.
