POE::Filter::XML provides POE with a completely encapsulated XML
parsing strategy for POE::Wheels that will be dealing with XML
streams. By default the filter will attempt to use XML::Parser as
its foundation for xml parsing. Otherwise it will depend upon a
pure perl SAX parser included (POE::Filter::XML::Parser).
