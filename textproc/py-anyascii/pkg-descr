AnyAscii converts Unicode text to a reasonable representation using only ASCII.

For most characters in Unicode, AnyAscii provides an ASCII-only replacement
string. Text is converted character-by-character without considering the
context. The mappings for each script are based on popular existing romanization
schemes. Symbolic characters are converted based on their meaning or appearance.
All ASCII characters in the input are left unchanged, every other character is
replaced with printable ASCII characters. Unknown characters are removed.
