Cloud Profiler is a statistical, low-overhead profiler that continuously gathers CPU
usage and memory-allocation information from your production applications.
It attributes that information to the application's source code, helping you identify
the parts of the application consuming the most resources, and otherwise illuminating
the performance characteristics of the code. Note that google-cloud-profiler-v2 is a
version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main
client library google-cloud-profiler instead. See the readme for more details.
