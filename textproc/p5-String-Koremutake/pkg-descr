The String::Koremutake module converts to and from Koremutake Memorable
Random Strings.

The term "Memorable Random String" was thought up by Sean B. Palmer as a
name for those strings like dopynl, glargen, glonknic, spoopwiddle, and
kebble etc. that don't have any conventional sense, but can be used as
random identifiers, especially in URIs to keep them persistent. See

Koremutake is a MeRS algorithm which is used by Shorl
(http://shorl.com/koremutake.php). As they explain: "It is, in plain
language, a way to express any large number as a sequence of syllables.
The general idea is that word-sounding pieces of information are a lot
easier to remember than a sequence of digits."
