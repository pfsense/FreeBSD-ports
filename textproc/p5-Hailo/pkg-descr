Hailo is a fast and lightweight markov engine intended to replace AI::MegaHAL.
Hailso has a Mouse (or Moose) based core with pluggable storage, tokenizer and
engine backends.

Hailo is similar to MegaHAL in functionality, the main differences (with the
default backends) being better scalability, drastically less memory usage, an
improved tokenizer, and tidier output.

With Hailo, you can create, modify, and query Hailo brains. To use Hailo in
event-driven POE applications, you can use the POE::Component::Hailo wrapper.
