This is a new release of the popular cleanfeed usenet spam filter written
by Jeremy Nixon. I will continue releasing new versions until I get tired
or somebody else will step forward.

There is no real documentation, so if you never used cleanfeed please
download the original package from
and enjoy trying to understand what changed.

If you already have an existing cleanfeed installation please double check
your cleanfeed.local, because it may not be compatibile with this release.
cleanfeed.conf does not exist anymore, the bad_cancel_paths config option
is now read from a configuration file and most local_* functions changed
their name. Please read the CHANGES file for details about these and other
things. When in doubt, check the source code.
