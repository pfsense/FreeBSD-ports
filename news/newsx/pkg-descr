Newsx is an NNTP client for Unix. It will connect to a remote NNTP
server and post outgoing articles batched by the news system, as well as
fetch incoming articles.

It provides the NNTP capabilities required for small local news spools
on installations with NNTP access only through limited ISP accounts. It
works well via a dialup SLIP/PPP connection.

Newsx is also well suited for large spools with normal feeds, being
used for pulling newsgroups from specific NNTP servers that are not
distributed in the usual manner. Since newsx obeys the normal news spool
configuration file and requires little or no specific configuration, the
administrative burden should be minimized.
