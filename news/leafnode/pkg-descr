Leafnode v1.11 is a simple, IPv6 enabled NNTP server and client
designed for small sites. (Think store & forward proxy if you like.)

It "learns" which newsgroups should be downloaded based on what's accessed.
Use it to enable online newsreaders to offline reading or to reduce your
external bandwidth if you have several users accessing Usenet news.
