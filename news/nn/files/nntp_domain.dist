# nntp_domain: Configuration file for NN newsreader
#
# Set the default domain name portion of user e-mail addresses as you
# would like them to appear in the From: line of articles posted
# with NN.
#
# For example, setting the name to foobar.com in this file will cause
# the From: line for joeuser to look like something like this:
#
# From: joeuser@foobar.com (Joe User)
#
# If this file is left blank, NN will use the hostname of this
# computer as the From: domain name.
