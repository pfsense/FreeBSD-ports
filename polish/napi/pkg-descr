"napi.sh" is a napiprojekt.pl client written in Bash. The purpose of the project
was to create simple tool for systems with very limited resources (NAS QNAP
drives, Synology, OpenWRT routers, Popcorn streamers, etc). It was inspired by
"pynapi.py" script.

"napi.sh" is distributed together with automatic subtitle format converter
"subotage.sh" created specially for "napi.sh". "subotage.sh" is written in Bash
and uses awk for text processing.
