ebusd is a daemon for handling communication with eBUS devices connected to a
2-wire bus system ("energy bus" used by numerous heating systems).

It is known to run fine on regular PC hardware as well as on smaller devices
like Fritzbox and Raspberry Pi. In order to use it, a hardware interface is
necessary.
