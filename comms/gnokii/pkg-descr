Gnokii is a Unix/Linux tool suite for mobile phones. It provides a
library to communicate with a phone hiding the communication protocol.
The library handles SMS, phonebook, calendar, phone calls, and other
mobile phone capabilities. It supports most of the GSM phones: Nokia
ones using Nokia proprietary protocol and AT-capable ones -- using
standard AT commands.
