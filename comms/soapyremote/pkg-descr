Use any SoapySDR supported device transparently over a local network link. The
remote support feature can turn any SDR into a network peripheral.

Potential use-cases for Soapy Remote:
* share the SDR device over a network
* use the device in multiple processes
* or use the device on multiple hosts
* a multi-threaded abstraction layer
* aid in embedded-device development
* or a work-around for software issues
* adapt an IPv4 SDR for an IPv6 network
