Amateur radio logbook GUI and logbook server for use with fldigi and friends.
The logbook server maintains a large set of QSO logbook fields that will
probably be sufficient for casual operating, contesting and some certificate
logging.  All of the fields that are captured in the logbook are maintained
in an ADIF database.
