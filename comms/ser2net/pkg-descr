This is ser2net, a program for allowing network connections to serial
ports.  See the man page for information about using the program.

Note that ser2net supports RFC 2217 (remote control of serial port
parameters), but you must have a compliant client.  The only one I
know if is kermit (http://www.columbia.edu/kermit).
