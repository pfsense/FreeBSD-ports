Lime Suite is a collection of software supporting several hardware platforms
including the LimeSDR, drivers for the LMS7002M transceiver RFIC, and other
tools for developing with LMS7-based hardware. Installing the Lime Suite
enables many SDR applications such as GQRX to work with supported hardware
through the bundled SoapySDR support module.
