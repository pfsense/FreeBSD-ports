FLMSG is a simple forms management editor for the amateur radio supported
standard message formats. Form data can be transferred between computers either
using standard internet email or via radio frequency broadcasts typically made
by an amateur radio operator on your behalf. FLMSG forms can be very complex and
include embedded images and other controls that make data entry less error to
prone. The template information is not transferred between computers, only the
volatile information contained in the form entry controls. The form template
must reside on each flmsg computer that will be used to create, edit, or review
the data.
