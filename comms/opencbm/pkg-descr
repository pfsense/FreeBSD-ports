Commodore CBM serial IEC/IEEE-488 bus utilities

The OpenCBM package contains user space support programs and development
libraries to control and use CBM serial IEC/IEEE-488 bus devices as used by
most Commodore (CBM) 8-bit machines.

OpenCBM allows for access to Commodore seriel IEC bus devices such as CBM
1540, 1541, 1570, 1571 and 1581 floppy disk drives.

OpenCBM allows for access to Commodore (parallel) IEEE-488 bus devices such as
CBM 2031, 2040, 3040, 4031, 4040, 8050, 8250, 8280 and SFD-1001 floppy disk
drives.

The devices are connected via a custom USB adapter (called xu1541 or xum1541).
A fast .d64 disk copier/transfer program is included.
