xdemorse is a X/GTK+-3 application for decoding Morse code signals into text.
xdemorse detects the "dihs" and "dahs" that make a Morse code character via the
computer's sound card, which can be connected to a radio receiver tuned to a CW
Morse code transmission or to a tone generator. The input signal is processed by
a Goertzel tone detector algorithm which produces "mark" or "space" (signal/no
signal) outputs and the resulting stream of Morse code "elements" is decoded
into an ASCII character for printing to the Text viewer.
