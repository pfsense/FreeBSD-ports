The overall goal of this project is to provide remote control service on Linux
through Bluetooth, InfraRed, Wi-Fi or just TCP/IP connection.

anyRemote supports wide range of modern cell phones like Nokia, SonyEricsson,
Motorola and others.

It was developed as thin communication layer between Bluetooth (or IR, Wi-Fi)
capabled phone and UNIX, and in principle could be configured to manage almost
any software.
