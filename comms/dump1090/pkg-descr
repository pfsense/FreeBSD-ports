Dump 1090 is a Mode S decoder specifically designed for RTLSDR devices.

The main features are:

* Robust decoding of weak messages.
* Network support: TCP30003 stream (MSG5...), Raw packets, HTTP.
* Embedded HTTP server that displays the currently detected aircrafts on
  Google Map.
* Single bit errors correction using the 24 bit CRC.
* Ability to decode DF11, DF17 messages.
* Ability to decode DF formats like DF0, DF4, DF5, DF16, DF20 and DF21 where the
  checksum is xored with the ICAO address by brute forcing the checksum field
  using recently seen ICAO addresses.
* Decode raw IQ samples from file (using --ifile command line switch).
* Interactive command-line-interfae mode where aircrafts currently detected are
  shown as a list refreshing as more data arrives.
* CPR coordinates decoding and track calculation from velocity.
* TCP server streaming and receiving raw data to/from connected clients.
