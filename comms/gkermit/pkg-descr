G-Kermit file transfer utility
------------------------------

G-Kermit is a Unix program for uploading and downloading files with the
Kermit protocol.  It is:

 . Stable and low-maintenance
 . Small and fast with no frills
 . Released under the GNU Public License

G-Kermit is command-line only (no interactive commands or scripting) and
remote-mode only (no making connections).  It has an extremely simple
user interface, and implements a large subset of the Kermit protocol in
a small amount of highly portable code.
