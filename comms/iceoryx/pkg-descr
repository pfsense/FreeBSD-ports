Iceoryx is an inter-process-communication (IPC) middleware. It has its origins
in the automotive industry, where large amounts of data have to be transferred
between different processes when it comes to driver assistance or automated
driving systems. However, the efficient communication mechanisms can also be
applied to a wider range of use cases, e.g. in the field of robotics or game
development. Iceoryx uses a true zero-copy, shared memory approach that allows
to transfer data from publishers to subscribers without a single copy. This
ensures data transmissions with constant latency, regardless of the size of the
payload.
