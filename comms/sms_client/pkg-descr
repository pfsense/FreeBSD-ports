A simple UNIX client allowing you to send SMS messages to mobile phones
and pagers. The software currently supports a number of providers
and protocols from various countries.

Using an unlisted provider that allows TAP access should be pretty straight

There are a large number of services that do not appear to use TAP, but

with a modem. For several UK based services such as these drivers have been
written, note that providers often offer more that one service and as such
you may require a different driver for each one.
