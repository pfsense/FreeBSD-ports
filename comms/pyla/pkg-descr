What's Pyla Project?
 Pyla wants to be a new Hylafax client entirely
 written using the Python interpreter.

What can I do with Pyla?
 With Pyla you can basically send and manage faxes.
 It actually mimics WHFC in its interface so if you like WHFC,
 you'll probably feel comfortable with Pyla too.

Why should I use Pyla?
 There're a lot of Hylafax clients out there,
 Pyla's main advantage is probably its platform independence.
