Wmclock is an applet which displays the date and time in a dockable
tile in the same style as the clock from the NEXTSTEP(tm) operating
system.  Wmclock is specially designed for the Window Maker window
manager and features multiple language support, twenty-four-hour
and twelve-hour (am/pm) time display, and, optionally, can run a
user-specified program on a mouse click.
