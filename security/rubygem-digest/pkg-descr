Digest provides a framework for message digest libraries.

You may want to look at OpenSSL::Digest as it supports more algorithms.

A cryptographic hash function is a procedure that takes data and returns a fixed
bit string: the hash value, also known as digest. Hash functions are also called
one-way functions, it is easy to compute a digest from a message, but it is
infeasible to generate a message from a digest.
