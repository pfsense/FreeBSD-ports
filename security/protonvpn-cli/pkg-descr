protonvpn-cli is an user-friendly command-line tool for accessing the
swiss-based privacy-focused ProtonVPN VPN service.
You need a ProtonVPN account to use it: you can create one at
https://protonvpn.com. Free accounts are available, although with
limited features: only 3 countries (Netherlands, USA, Japan) are
available with the free plan.
It can also easily add an extra layer of privacy by activating Tor
(needs payed plan).

No manual page is provided with protonvpn-cli, but you can get help
on usage by running protonvpn-cli -h.

Warning: although user is asked about enabling a killswitch or not, no
killswitch is available at the moment.
