SSLproxy is a proxy for SSL/TLS encrypted network connections. It is intended to
be used for decrypting and diverting network traffic to other programs, such as
UTM services, for deep SSL inspection.

SSLproxy is designed to transparently terminate connections that are redirected
to it using a network address translation engine. SSLproxy then terminates
SSL/TLS and initiates a new SSL/TLS connection to the original destination
address. Packets received on the client side are decrypted and sent to the
program listening on a port given in the proxy specification. SSLproxy inserts
in the first packet the address and port it is expecting to receive the packets
back from the program. Upon receiving the packets back, SSLproxy re-encrypts and
sends them to their original destination. The return traffic follows the same
path back to the client in reverse order.
