FreeBSD does not, and can not warrant that the certification authorities
whose certificates are included in this package have in any way been
audited for trustworthiness or RFC 3647 compliance.

Assessment and verification of trust is the complete responsibility of
the system administrator.

This package installs symlinks to support root certificate discovery
for software that either uses other cryptographic libraries than
OpenSSL, or use OpenSSL but do not follow recommended practice.

If you prefer to do this manually, replace the following symlinks with
either an empty file or your site-local certificate bundle.

  * /etc/ssl/cert.pem
  * %%PREFIX%%/etc/ssl/cert.pem
  * %%PREFIX%%/openssl/cert.pem
