This library handles the low-level details of NTLM authentication for use
in authenticating with a service that uses NTLM. It will create and parse
the 3 different message types in the order required and produce a base64
encoded value that can be attached to the HTTP header.

The goal of this library is to offer full NTLM support including signing and
sealing of messages as well as supporting MIC for message integrity and the
ability to customise and set limits on the messages sent. Please see Features
and Backlog for a list of what is and is not currently supported.

Features:
* LM, NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication
* NTLM1 and NTLM2 extended session security
* Set the The NTLM Compatibility level when sending messages
* Channel Binding Tokens support, need to pass in the SHA256 hash
  of the certificate for it to work
* Support for MIC to enhance the integrity of the messages
* Support for session security with signing and sealing messages
  after authentication happens
