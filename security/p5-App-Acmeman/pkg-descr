Perl module and command line utility for issuing and maintaining the ACME
(Let's Encrypt) SSL certificates.

While most existing ACME tools take a list of domain names for which to
issue certificates from their command line or configuration file, acmeman
gathers domain names directly from the configuration of the HTTP server
that serves them, so domain name obtains its certificate automatically,
once the administrator configures the HTTP server to serve it via HTTPS.

The utility is normally run as a cron(8) job.
