Setup and retrieve HTTPS and SSH credentials for use with 'git'
and other services. For HTTPS remotes the package interfaces
the 'git-credential' utility which 'git' uses to store HTTP
usernames and passwords. For SSH remotes we provide convenient
functions to find or generate appropriate SSH keys. The package
both helps the user to setup a local git installation, and also
provides a back-end for git/ssh client libraries to authenticate
with existing user credentials.
