PALISADE is a general lattice cryptography library that currently includes
efficient implementations of the following lattice cryptography capabilities:

* Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
* Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme for integer arithmetic
* Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme for integer arithmetic
* Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme for real-number arithmetic
* Ducas-Micciancio (FHEW) and Chillotti-Gama-Georgieva-Izabachene (TFHE) schemes
  for Boolean circuit evaluation
* Stehle-Steinfeld scheme for limited integer arithmetic
* Multi-Party Extensions of FHE (to support multi-key FHE)
* Threshold FHE for BGV, BFV, and CKKS schemes
* Proxy Re-Encryption for BGV, BFV, and CKKS schemes
* Digital Signature
* Identity-Based Encryption
* Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption
