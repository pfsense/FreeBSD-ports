This is a library to simulate SSL and TLS handshake from 
SSLv2, SSLv3, to TLS 1.0-1.2. It does not rely on OpenSSL 
and is not designed as a replacement either. It targets full 
support for even older handshakes, which are not available in 
current releases of OpenSSL anymore. It also aims to be executable 
on all systems with a sufficiently modern version of Ruby without 
any additional requirements or pre-compiled binaries.
