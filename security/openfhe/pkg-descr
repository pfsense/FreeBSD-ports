Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful cryptographic primitive that
enables performing computations over encrypted data without having access to the
secret key. OpenFHE is an open-source FHE library that includes efficient
implementations of all common FHE schemes:
* Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme for integer arithmetic
* Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme for integer arithmetic
* Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme for real-number arithmetic (includes
  approximate bootstrapping)
* Ducas-Micciancio (DM) and Chillotti-Gama-Georgieva-Izabachene (CGGI) schemes
  for evaluating Boolean circuits and arbitrary functions over larger plaintext
  spaces using lookup tables

OpenFHE also includes the following multiparty extensions of FHE:
* Threshold FHE for BGV, BFV, and CKKS schemes
* Proxy Re-Encryption for BGV, BFV, and CKKS schemes
