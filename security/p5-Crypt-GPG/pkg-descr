The Crypt::GPG module provides access to the functionality of the GnuPG
(www.gnupg.org) encryption tool through an object oriented interface.
It provides methods for encryption, decryption, signing, signature
verification, key generation, key certification, export and import.
Key-server access is on the todo list.
This release of the module may create compatibility issues with previous
versions. If you find any such problems, or any bugs or documentation
errors, please do report them to crypt-gpg at neomailbox.com.
