DotDotPwn - The Directory Traversal Fuzzer

It is a very flexible intelligent fuzzer to discover traversal
directory vulnerabilities in software such as HTTP/FTP/TFTP servers,
Web platforms such as CMSs, ERPs, Blogs, etc.

It has a protocol-independent module to send the desired payload
to the host and port specified.  On the other hand, it also could
be used in a scripting way using the STDOUT module.

It is written in Perl.
