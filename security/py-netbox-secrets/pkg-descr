This is the continuation of the NetBox Secretstore app. The original plugin is
minimally maintained and has a lot of issues.

This plugin is a complete rewrite of the original plugin.  It is more generic
and flexible than the original plugin.  It is also regularly tested with the
latest NetBox releases to ensure compatibility and stability.

Features:

* Store secrets in the database encrypted with a public key (RSA)
* More generic and flexible than the original plugin (e.g. secrets
  can be assigned to any object in NetBox)
* Secrets can be assigned to contacts to associate them with
  a secret (e.g. SSH key)
* Updated user interface to make it easier to use and more intuitive
  to navigate
* Regularly tested with the latest NetBox releases to ensure
  compatibility and stability
