Nmap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing.<br/>
			It supports ping scanning (determine which hosts are
			up), many port scanning techniques (determine what
			services the hosts are offering), version detection
			(determine what application/service is running on a
			port), and TCP/IP fingerprinting (remote host OS or
			device identification).  It also offers flexible target
			and port specification, decoy/stealth scanning, SunRPC
			scanning, and more.
