HoneyTrap is a modular framework for running, monitoring and managing honeypots.
Using HoneyTrap you can use sensors, high interaction and low
interaction honeypots together, while still using the same event mechanisms.
HoneyTrap consists of services, directors, listeners and channels. It is easy to
build new services, attach existing honeypots and extend channels or directors.
