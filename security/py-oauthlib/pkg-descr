OAuthLib is a framework which implements the logic of OAuth1 or OAuth2 without
assuming a specific HTTP request object or web framework. Use it to graft OAuth
client support onto your favorite HTTP library, or provide support onto your
favourite web framework. If you're a maintainer of such a library, write a thin
veneer on top of OAuthLib and get OAuth support for very little effort.
