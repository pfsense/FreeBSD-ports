A high level, "more Pythonic" interface to the PKCS#11 (Cryptoki) standard to
support HSM and Smartcard devices in Python.

The interface is designed to follow the logical structure of a HSM, with useful
defaults for obscurely documented parameters. Many APIs will optionally accept
iterables and act as generators, allowing you to stream large data blocks for
symmetric encryption.

python-pkcs11 also includes numerous utility functions to convert between PKCS
#11 data structures and common interchange formats including PKCS #1 and X.509.

python-pkcs11 is fully documented and has a full integration test suite for all
features, with continuous integration against multiple HSM platforms including:
- Thales nCipher
- Opencryptoki TPM
- OpenSC/Smartcard-HSM/Nitrokey HSM
