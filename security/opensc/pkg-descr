OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to
access smart cards. Its main focus is on cards that
support cryptographic operations, and facilitate their
use in security applications such as mail encryption,
authentication, and digital signature.

OpenSC implements the PKCS#11 API so applications
supporting this API such as Mozilla Firefox and
Thunderbird can use it.

OpenSC implements the PKCS#15 standard and aims to be
compatible with every software that does so, too.
