       This perl module provides support for the https protocol
       under LWP, so that a LWP::UserAgent can make https GET &
       HEAD & POST requests. Please see perldoc LWP for more
       information on POST requests.

       The Crypt::SSLeay package contains Net::SSL, which is
       automatically loaded by LWP::Protocol::https on https
       requests, and provides the necessary SSL glue for that
       module to work via these deprecated modules:

          Crypt::SSLeay::CTX
          Crypt::SSLeay::Conn
          Crypt::SSLeay::X509

       Work on Crypt::SSLeay has been continued only to provide
       https support for the LWP - libwww perl libraries.  If you
       want access to the OpenSSL API via perl, check out Sampo's
       Net::SSLeay.
