muacrypt is a support tool for implementing Autocrypt Level 1 compliant
mail agents.

Autocrypt state is kept in one or more accounts which process and produce
autocrypt headers from respective incoming and outgoing e-mail. Each account
is tied to a set of e-mail addresses, specified as a regular expression.

Functionality is exposed through a command line tool muacrypt and a Python
API obtained through import muacrypt.
