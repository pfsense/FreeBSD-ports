This is a fork of OpenSSL to enable QUIC. This fork adds API that can be 
used by QUIC implementations for connection handshakes.

There is a community need for a QUIC capable TLS library. This fork is 
intended as stopgap solution to enable higher level frameworks and runtimes 
to use QUIC with the proven and reliable TLS functionality from OpenSSL. 
This fork will be maintained until OpenSSL officially provides reasonable 
support for QUIC implementations.
