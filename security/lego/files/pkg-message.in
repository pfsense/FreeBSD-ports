There are sample scripts in
    %%ETCDIR%%
that you can use for renewing and deploying certificates.

In order to run the script regularly to update the certificates add this line
to /etc/periodic.conf:

    weekly_lego_enable="YES"

Additionally the following parameters may be added to /etc/periodic.conf:

Script to run to renew certificates, will be run as %%LEGO_USER%% (required)
    weekly_lego_renewscript="%%ETCDIR%%/lego.sh"

To run a script after the renewal to deploy certificates
    weekly_lego_deployscript="%%ETCDIR%%/deploy.sh"

Note that the deploy script is provided as a sample and may need to be modified
for your environment. The script will attempt to deploy certificates to
    %%ETCDIR%%/ssl/certs
and private keys to
    %%ETCDIR%%/ssl/private.
The script also tries to restart nginx.

If using the sample renew script, add the domains for which lego will manage
certificates to
    %%ETCDIR%%/domains.txt, one domain on each line.

To add a Subject Alternate Name to the certificate, append the domain(s) to the
line:
    example.com www.example.com

To run lego for the first time, edit
    %%ETCDIR%%/lego.sh
and set the EMAIL variable.

Then run lego.sh with the run argument as the %%LEGO_USER%% user:
    $ %%ETCDIR%%/lego.sh run

Subsequent periodic runs will run with the renew argument by default, with a
renewal interval of 30 days.
