Sudo runs commands as another user, provided the system sudo
implementation is setup to enable this. This does not allow running
applications securely, simply it allows the programmer to run a
program as another user (suid) using the sudo tools rather than
suidperl. Suidperl is not generally recommended for secure operation
as another user. While sudo itself is a single point tool to enable
one user to execute commands as another sudo does not itself make you
any more or less secure.
