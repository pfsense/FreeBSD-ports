Net::Radius::Server provides an extensible framework to create RADIUS
servers suitable for non-standard scenarios where authentication
needs to consider multiple factors. The RADIUS responses may be
created by arbitrarily complex rules that process the request packet
as well as any external data accessible to Perl.
