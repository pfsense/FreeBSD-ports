The Greenbone Vulnerability Management Python API library (python-gvm) is a 
collection of APIs that help with remote controlling a Greenbone Security 
Manager (GSM) appliance and its underlying Greenbone Vulnerability Manager 
(GVM). 

The library essentially abstracts accessing the communication protocols 
Greenbone Management Protocol (GMP) and Open Scanner Protocol (OSP)
