SSLsplit is a tool for man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL/TLS encrypted
network connections. Connections are transparently intercepted through a
network address translation engine and redirected to SSLsplit. SSLsplit
terminates SSL/TLS and initiates a new SSL/TLS connection to the original
destination address, while logging all data transmitted. SSLsplit is intended
to be useful for network forensics and penetration testing.
