NFLlib is an efficient and open-source C++ library dedicated to ideal lattice
cryptography. It is specialized in polynomial rings quotiented by a cyclotomic
polynomial whose degree is a power of two. The library combines algorithmic
optimizations (Chinese Remainder Theorem, optimized Number Theoretic Transform)
together with programming optimization techniques (SSE and AVX2 specializations,
C++ expression templates, etc.)
