This module implements Ueli Maurer's algorithm for generating large
provable primes and secure parameters for public-key cryptosystems.
The generated primes are almost uniformly distributed over the set of
primes of the specified bitsize and expected time for generation is
less than the time required for generating a pseudo-prime of the same
size with Miller-Rabin tests. Detailed description and running time
analysis of the algorithm can be found in Maurer's paper[1].

Crypt::Primes is a pure perl implementation. It uses Math::Pari for
multiple precision integer arithmetic and number theoretic functions.
Random numbers are gathered with Crypt::Random, a perl interface to
/dev/u?random devices found on modern Unix operating systems.
