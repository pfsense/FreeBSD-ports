The Apache-XML-Security-J supports XML-Signature Syntax and Processing,
W3C Recommendation 12 February 2002 and XML Encryption Syntax and
Processing, W3C Recommendation 10 December 2002.

The Java library supports the standard Java API JSR-105: XML Digital
Signature APIs for creating and validating XML Signatures. A standard
Java API for XML Encryption JSR-106: XML Digital Encryption APIs is
in progress and is not final, so this API is not yet supported.
