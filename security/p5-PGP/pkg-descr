This is an alpha release of a PGP module for Perl5.This module will allow
for an easy interface to both Phil Zimmermann'sPGP (v2.6.2) program and the
international version of PGP (v2.6.2i).

PGP.pm will allow you to sign, encrypt (w/signature), decrypt and perform
key management. The only requirement being that you alreadyhave PGP
installed on your system to utilize this module.There are sure to be many
changes in the structure of this module overthe next couple of months--at
least until a standard interface is acheived.

If you find this module useful and wish to see future developments of it,
the contribute to Phil Zimmermann's legal defense fund. Ifyou don't know
anything about the government's attempt to wrongfully prosecute Phil, then
go to Yahoo and search for "Zimmermann." After reading for a little while,
you will be wondering how the governmentis getting away with it's criminal
act.
