The ModSecurity-apache connector is the connection point between Apache and libmodsecurity
(ModSecurity v3). Said another way, this project provides a communication channel between Apache
and libmodsecurity. This connector is required to use LibModSecurity with Apache.

The ModSecurity-apache connector takes the form of an Apache module.
The module simply serves as a layer of communication between Apache and ModSecurity.

Notice that this project depends on libmodsecurity rather than ModSecurity (version 2.9 or less).
