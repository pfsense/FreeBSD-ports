In order to enroll new finger prints, you must have r/w access to the
usb device node(s) of your finger print reader (i.e., /dev/{ugen, usb}*).

It is recommended to use devfs.rules(5) and a dedicated group to manage
access to your finger print reader.

You can use `usbconfig' to see if your sensor is accessible.

Example configuration:
- /etc/rc.conf:
devfs_system_ruleset="localrules"

- /etc/devfs.rules:
[localrules=10]
add path 'usb' mode 0770 group operator
add path 'usb/*' mode 0660 group operator

# /etc/rc.d/devfs restart
EOM
