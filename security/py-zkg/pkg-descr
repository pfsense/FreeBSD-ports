The Zeek Package Manager makes it easy for Zeek users to install and manage
third party scripts as well as plugins for Zeek and ZeekControl.

The command-line tool is preconfigured to download packages from the Zeek
package source, a GitHub repository that has been setup such that any developer
can request their Zeek package be included.

See the README file of that repository for information regarding the package
submission process.

NOTE:

It's left up to users to decide for themselves via code review, GitHub
comments/stars, or other metrics whether any given package is trustworthy as
there is no implied guarantees that it's secure just because it's been accepted
into the default package source. See the package manager documentation for
further usage information, how-to guides, and walkthroughs.
