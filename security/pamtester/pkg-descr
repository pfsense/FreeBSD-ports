pamtester is a tiny utility program to test the pluggable authentication
modules (PAM) facility, which is a de facto standard of unified authentication
management mechanism in many unices and similar OSes including Solaris, HP-UX,
*BSD, MacOSX and Linux.

While specifically designed to help PAM module authors to test their modules,
that might also be handy for system administrators interested in building a
centralised authentication system using common standards such as NIS, SASL and
LDAP.
