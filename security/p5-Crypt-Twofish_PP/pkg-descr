Twofish is a 128-bit symmetric block cipher with a variable key
length (128, 192, or 256 bits) key, developed by Counterpane Labs.
It is unpatented and free for all uses, as described at
http://www.counterpane.com/twofish.html. It has been one of the
five finalists for AES.

This module is written in pure Perl, it should run everywhere
where Perl runs.
