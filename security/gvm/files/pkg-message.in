GVM ports were installed

If you are migrating to new version do not forget do the following:

  # su -m gvm -c "gvmd --migrate"

Basic instructions for configure your gvm infraestruture are following:

1) Redis is a dependency of GVM. Please, configure redis-server for 
   listening on socket /var/run/redis/redis.sock. security/openvas scanner 
   needs it

  # echo "db_address = /var/run/redis/redis.sock" > /usr/local/etc/openvas/openvas.conf

2) Add user gvm to redis group

  # pw groupmod redis -M gvm

3) security/gvmd uses PostgreSQL database. Generally, PostgreSQL must be 
   installed in the same server where security/gvmd is running: 

  # su postgres
  # createuser -DRS gvm
  # createdb -O gvm gvmd
  # psql gvmd
  # create role dba with superuser noinherit;
  # grant dba to gvm;
  # create extension "uuid-ossp";
  # create extension "pgcrypto";

4) Add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf

  # sysrc redis_enable="YES"
  # sysrc gvmd_enable="YES"
  # sysrc ospd_openvas_enable="YES"
  # sysrc gsad_enable="YES"

5) Currently, ospd_openvas should run as a user without elevated privileges 
   (gvm) and use sudo for run openvas scanner but it does not work properly. 
   Like a workaround you must run redis as root and the same with ospd_openvas.

   Add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf

   redis_user="root"
   ospd_openvas_user="root"

   Take in mind it is not the best configuration for run ospd_openvas and
   openvas. 

6) The following steps are neccessary before of you can access to GVM web 
   interface (gsad):

  Start gvmd service. It will listen on /var/run/gvmd/gvmd.sock by default

  # service gvmd start

  Create certificates

  # su -m gvm -c "gvm-manage-certs -a"

  Sync gvmd Data, SCAP, CERT and NVT

  # su -m gvm -c "greenbone-nvt-sync"
  # su -m gvm -c "greenbone-feed-sync --type GVMD_DATA"
  # su -m gvm -c "greenbone-feed-sync --type SCAP"
  # su -m gvm -c "greenbone-feed-sync --type CERT"

  Create an admin user and set the Feed Import Owner

  # su -m gvm -c "gvmd --create-user=myuser"
  # su -m gvm -c "gvmd --user=myuser --new-password=yourpassword"

  Set the Feed Import Owner (myuser user in this example)

  # su -m gvm -c "gvmd --get-users --verbose"
  myuser <uuid_of_user>
   
  # su -m gvm -c "gvmd --modify-setting 78eceaec-3385-11ea-b237-28d24461215b --value <uuid_of_user>

7) Start OSPD-OpenVAS Wrapper service. It will listen on /var/run/ospd/ospd.sock by default

  # service ospd_openvas start

  you can test if ospd_openvas is connecting with openvas scanner with the following commands:

  # su -m gvm -c "gvmd --get-scanners"
  6acd0832-df90-11e4-b9d5-28d24461215b  CVE    0  CVE
  08b69003-5fc2-4037-a479-93b440211c73  OpenVAS  /var/run/ospd/ospd.sock  0  OpenVAS Default

  # su -m gvm -c "gvmd --verify-scanner=08b69003-5fc2-4037-a479-93b440211c73"
  Scanner version: OpenVAS x.x.x

8) Start GVM web interface. It will listen on http://127.0.0.1 by default

  # service gsad start

9) Some openvas scanner tasks  need access to /dev/bpf device. Add the 
   following lines to /etc/devfs.conf

   own     bpf     root:gvm
   perm    bpf     0660

   And restart service for apply the changes

   # service devfs restart

10) gvm log files are stores to /var/log/gvm directory

11) gsad can export results to PDF. It needs print/texlive-texmf port
  
  # pkg install texlive-texmf

  It will install 1G of data

12) If you need more configure information you can look at the following links:

   https://github.com/greenbone/gvmd/blob/master/INSTALL.md
   https://github.com/greenbone/openvas/blob/master/INSTALL.md
   https://github.com/greenbone/ospd/blob/master/doc/INSTALL-ospd-scanner.md
   https://github.com/greenbone/gsa/blob/master/INSTALL.md

   and

   # gvmd -h
   # openvas -h
   # ospd-openvas -h
   # gsad -h

13) Enjoy it
