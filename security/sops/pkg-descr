SOPS is a wrapper around a text editor that transparently takes care of the
encryption and decryption. It supports YAML, JSON and BINARY formats and
encrypts with AWS KMS and PGP. When encrypting YAML and JSON, the content of
the file is manipulated as a tree where keys are stored in cleartext, and
values are encrypted.
