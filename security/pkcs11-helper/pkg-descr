pkcs11-helper is a library that simplifies the interaction
with PKCS#11 providers for end-user applications.

pkcs11-helper allows using multiple PKCS#11 providers at
the same time, enumerating available token certificates, or
selecting a certificate directly by serialized id, handling
card removal and card insert events, handling card re-insert
to a different slot, supporting session expiration and much
more all using a simple API.

pkcs11-helper is not designed to manage card content, since
object attributes are usually vendor specific, and 99% of
application need to access existing objects in order to
perform signature and decryption.
