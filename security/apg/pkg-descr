apg-go is a simple APG-like password generator written in Go.

It tries to replicate the functionality of the "Automated Password Generator",
which hasn't been maintained since 2003. Since more and more Unix
distributions are abondoning the tool, I was looking for an alternative.

Since FIPS-181 (pronouncable passwords) has been withdrawn in 2015, I didn't
see any use in replicating that feature. Therfore apg.go does not support
pronouncable passwords.
