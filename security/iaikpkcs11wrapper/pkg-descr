This is a library for the Java platform which makes PKCS#11 (also known
as Cryptoki) modules accessible from within Java. A PKCS#11 module is a
software library with a defined API which allows access to cryptographic
hardware. It usually comes with hardware security modules (HSM), smart
cards and crypto tokens (e.g. USB tokens). Thus, the PKCS#11 Wrapper
provides Java software access to almost any crypto hardware. For
example, a Java application can use it to integrate a HSM or a smart
card to create digital signatures, to decrypt data or to unwrap keys.
