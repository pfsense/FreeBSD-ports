The One Time Pad encryption method is very simple, and impossible
to crack without the actual pad file against which the to-be-encrypted
message is XOR'ed. Encryption and decryption are performed using
excactly the same method, and the message will decrypt correctly
only if the same pad is used in decryption as was use in encryption.
