HElib is a software library that implements homomorphic encryption (HE).
Currently available schemes are the implementations of the
Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme with bootstrapping and the
Approximate Number scheme of Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS), along with many
optimizations to make homomorphic evaluation run faster, focusing mostly
on effective use of the Smart-Vercauteren ciphertext packing techniques
and the Gentry-Halevi-Smart optimizations. See this report for a
description of a few of the algorithms using in this library.
