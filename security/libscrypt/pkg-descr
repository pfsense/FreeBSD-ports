Although the creator of scrypt has written an "example implementation", it
doesn't satisfy the "simple library" requirement that prompts developers to
implement it. Therefore, I've written my adaptation, which quite simply pulls
the relevant parts from the original implementation, then adds a number of
harnesses and simplified interfaces. The hope is that through this, any
developer can utilise scrypt.
