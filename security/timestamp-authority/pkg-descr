Trusted timestamping is a process that has been around for some time. It
provides a timestamp record of when a document was created or modified.

A timestamp authority creates signed timestamps using public key
infrastructure. The operator of the timestamp authority must secure the
signing key material to prevent unauthorized timestamp signing.

A timestamp authority should also verify its own clock. We provide a
configuration to periodically check the current time against well-known
NTP sources.
