testssl.sh is a command line tool which checks a server's service on
any port for the support of TLS/SSL ciphers, protocols as well as some
cryptographic flaws.  Key features:

- Clear output: you can tell easily whether anything is good or bad
- Machine readable output (CSV, two JSON formats)
- Flexibility: You can test any SSL/TLS enabled and STARTTLS service,
  not only webservers at port 443
- Toolbox: Several command line options help you to run your test and
  configure your output
- Reliability: features are tested thoroughly
- Privacy: It's only you who sees the result, not a third party
