Lib4SBOM is a library to parse and generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs).
It supports SBOMs created in both SPDX and CycloneDX formats.

It has been developed on the assumption that having a generic abstraction of
SBOM regardless of the underlying format will be useful to developers.

The following facilities are provided:
 * Generate SPDX SBOM in TagValue, JSON and YAML formats
 * Generate CycloneDX SBOM in JSON format
 * Parse SPDX SBOM in TagValue, JSON, YAML, XML and RDF formats
 * Parse CycloneDX SBOM in JSON and XMLformat
 * Create and manipulate a SBOM file object
 * Create and manipulate a SBOM package object
 * Create and manipulate a SBOM dependency relationship object
 * Create and manipulate a Vulnerability object
 * Create and manipulate a Software Service object
 * Generated SBOM can be output to a file or to the console
