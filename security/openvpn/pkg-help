DEPRECATED FEATURE - TO BE REMOVED END OF 2022-03-31 LATEST

Note that "Tunnelblick" is a controversial option.
It is included for compatibility, not enabled by default,
and should only be used with due consideration, and it should not
replace proper cryptography use in OpenVPN.

Note that this patch does NOT add documentation for the new --scramble
option, neither to the --help output, nor the manual page.

Please see this website for a more detailed discussion:
https://tunnelblick.net/cOpenvpn_xorpatch.html

The essence is that there are alternatives proposed that can avoid
this patch:

The OpenVPN developers "do not encourage people building their own
versions of OpenVPN changing the wire-protocol like this, without the
patch being through a proper patch review and having evaluated possible
security risks related to such a change.
  And we especially discourage using such an approach when there exists
a far better solution, used by the TOR community. It is called obfsproxy
and can be used together with OpenVPN without needing any re-compilation
of OpenVPN."
