Most of the existing OpenSSL extensions implement interfaces to particular set
of cryptoalgorthms. This extension takes another approach - it uses
algorithm-agnostic EVP layer whenever possible, and so it support any algorithms
which are supported by the underlying library, even this algorithms are
implemented in the loadable modules (engines). Algorithms which were just added
to the library should be supported too.
