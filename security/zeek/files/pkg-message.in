  message: <<EOM
During deinstall of this package, the cfg files for broctl
are not deleted if you have edited them.  Instead
the software will create a .sample file instead and the
edited files will remain in place when you upgrade.  If you
want to delete them, you have to delete them and the directory,
%%PREFIX%%/etc manually.
