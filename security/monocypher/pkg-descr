Monocypher is an easy to use crypto library. It is:

- Small. Sloccount counts about 1700 lines of code, small enough to
allow audits. The binaries are under 65KB.

- Easy to deploy. Just add monocypher.c and monocypher.h to your
project. They compile as C99 or C++, have no dependency, and
are dedicated to the public domain.

- Easy to use. The API is small, consistent, and cannot fail
on correct input.

- Fast. The primitives are fast to begin with, and performance
wasn't needlessly sacrificed. Monocypher holds up pretty well
against Libsodium, despite being closer in size to TweetNaCl.
