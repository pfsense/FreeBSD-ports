python-registry was originally written by Willi Ballenthin, a forensicator who
wanted to access the contents of the Windows Registry from his Linux laptop.
python-registry currently provides read-only access to Windows Registry files,
such as NTUSER.DAT, userdiff, and SOFTWARE. The interface is two-fold: a
high-level interface suitable for most tasks, and a low level set of parsing
objects and methods which may be used for advanced study of the Windows
Registry. python-registry is written in pure Python, making it portable across
all major platforms.
