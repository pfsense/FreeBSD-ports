sha3 wrapper (keccak) for Python. The package is a wrapper around the
optimized reference implementation from http://keccak.noekeon.org/ . Only
the optimizations for 32 and 64bit platforms are used. The optimized SSE and
ARM assembly variants are ignored for now.

The module is a standalone version of the SHA-3 implemention of Python 3.4
(currently under development).
