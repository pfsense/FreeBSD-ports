# formatting is simple
# <sid, category, list of sids&categories> "what I'm replacing" "what I'm replacing it with"
#
# Note that this will only work with GID:1 rules, simply because modifying
# GID:3 SO stub rules would not actually affect the rule.
#
# If you are attempting to change rulestate (enable,disable) from here
# then you are doing it wrong. Do this from within the respective 
# rulestate modification configuration files.

# the following applies to sid 10010 only and represents what would normally
# be s/to_client/from_server/
# 10010 "to_client" "from_server"

# the following would replace HTTP_PORTS with HTTPS_PORTS for ALL GID:1
# rules
# "HTTP_PORTS" "HTTPS_PORTS"

# multiple sids can be specified as noted below:
# 302,429,1821 "$EXTERNAL_NET" "$HOME_NET"

# modify all signatures in a category. Example: replace "$EXTERNAL_NETS" with "any" to be alerts on insider threats as well
# emerging-scan "$EXTERNAL_NET" "any"

# modify all signatures in multiple categories
# emerging-scan,emerging-sql "$EXTERNAL_NET" "any"

# modify all signatures for a category and specific SIDs from other categories
# emerging-sql,2100691,2009817 "$EXTERNAL_NET" "any"
