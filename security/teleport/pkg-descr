What is Teleport?
=================
Teleport is a gateway for managing access to clusters of *nix servers via
SSH or the Kubernetes API. While it does also support connecting to
servers running traditional OpenSSH, its own node deamon is intended to be
used instead for additional functionality.

With Teleport it is simple to adopt SSH best practices like using
certificate-based access and enabling 2FA via TOTP (e.g. Google
Authenticator), U2F or an SSO provider. Cluster nodes can be accessed via
a CLI (tsh) or a Web UI which both allow for session sharing.

Teleport provides centralized user management as well as full session
recordings that can be played back for knowledge sharing or auditing
purposes. It can also be used to protect Web applications like dashboards.
