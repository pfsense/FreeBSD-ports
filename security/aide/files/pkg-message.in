If you want to finish setting up AIDE, don't forget to customise your
own aide.conf in %%PREFIX%%/etc/aide.conf. You will also need to run
the following commands:

	cd /var/db/aide
	aide --init
	mv databases/aide.db.new databases/aide.db

You may want to change the permissions of the /var/adm/aide/ directory tree.

For your reference, a copy of the original aide.conf is supplied in
%%PREFIX%%/etc/aide.conf.sample.
