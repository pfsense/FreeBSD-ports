GOST 28147-89 is a 64-bit symmetric block cipher with a 256-bit
key developed in the former Soviet Union. Some information on it
is available at http://vipul.net/gost/ .
This module implements GOST encryption. It supports the Crypt::CBC
interface, with the functions described below. It also provides
an interface that is backwards- compatible with Crypt::GOST 0.41,
but its use in new code is discouraged.
