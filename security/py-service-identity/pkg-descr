Use this package if:
- you want to verify that a PyCA cryptography certificate is valid for a certain
  hostname or IP address,
- or if you use pyOpenSSL and donâ€™t want to be MITMed,
- or if you want to inspect certificates from either for service IDs.

service-identity aspires to give you all the tools you need for verifying
whether a certificate is valid for the intended purposes. In the simplest case,
this means host name verification. However, service-identity implements RFC 6125
fully.
