Network automation to screen-scraping devices is primarily concerned with
gathering output from show commands and with making configuration changes.

Netmiko aims to accomplish both of these operations and to do it across
a very broad set of platforms. It seeks to do this while abstracting away
low-level state control (i.e. eliminate low-level regex pattern matching
to the extent practical).
