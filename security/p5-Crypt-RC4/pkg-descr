A simple implementation of the RC4 algorithm, developed by RSA
Security, Inc. Here is the description from RSA's website:

RC4 is a stream cipher designed by Rivest for RSA Data Security
(now RSA Security). It is a variable key-size stream cipher with
byte-oriented operations. The algorithm is based on the use of a
random permutation. Analysis shows that the period of the cipher
is overwhelmingly likely to be greater than 10100. Eight to sixteen
machine operations are required per output byte, and the cipher can
be expected to run very quickly in software. Independent analysts
have scrutinized the algorithm and it is considered secure.

Based substantially on the "RC4 in 3 lines of perl" found at
