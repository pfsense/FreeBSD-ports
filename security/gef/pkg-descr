GEF (pronounced "Jeff") is a set of commands for x86/64, ARM, MIPS,
PowerPC and SPARC to assist exploit developers and reverse-engineers when using
old school GDB. It provides additional features to GDB using the Python API to
assist during the process of dynamic analysis and exploit development.
Application developers will also benefit from it, as GEF lifts a great part of
regular GDB obscurity, avoiding repeating traditional commands, or bringing out
the relevant information from the debugging runtime.

Some of GEF features include:
- One single GDB script.
- Fast limiting the number of dependencies and optimizing code to make the
  commands as fast as possible.
- Provides more than 50 commands to drastically change your experience in GDB.
- Easily extendable to create other commands by providing more comprehensible
  layout to GDB Python API.
- Built around an architecture abstraction layer, so all commands work in any
  GDB-supported architecture such as x86-32/64, ARMv5/6/7, AARCH64, SPARC,
  MIPS, PowerPC, etc.
- Suited for real-life apps debugging, exploit development, just as much as CTF.
