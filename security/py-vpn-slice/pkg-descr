This is a replacement for the vpnc-script used by OpenConnect or VPNC.

Instead of trying to copy the behavior of standard corporate VPN clients, which
normally reroute all your network traffic through the VPN, this one tries to
minimize your contact with an intrusive VPN. This is also known as a
split-tunnel VPN, since it splits your traffic between the VPN tunnel and your
normal network interfaces.
