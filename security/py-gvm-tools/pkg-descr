The Greenbone Vulnerability Management Tools gvm-tools are a collection of 
tools that help with remote controlling a Greenbone Security Manager (GSM) 
appliance and its underlying Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM). The tools 
aid in accessing the communication protocols GMP (Greenbone Management 
Protocol) and OSP (Open Scanner Protocol).

This module is comprised of interactive and non-interactive clients. The 
programming language Python is supported directly for interactive scripting. 
But it is also possible to issue remote GMP/OSP commands without programming 
in Python.
