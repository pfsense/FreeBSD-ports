pam_pkcs11 is a login module allowing a X.509 certificate
based user login. The certificate and its dedicated private
key are thereby accessed by means of an appropriate PKCS#11
module. For the verification of the users' certificates,
locally stored CA certificates as well as either online or
locally accessible CRLs are used.

PAM-PKCS#11 package provides:

    A PAM module able to:
        Use certificates to get user credentials
        Deduce a login based on provided certificate
    Several tools:
        Standalone cert-to-login finder tool
        Certificate contents viewer
        Card Event status monitor, to trigger actions on card insert/removal
