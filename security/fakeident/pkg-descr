This program is standalone 'fake' ident daemon. This program does
not fork() but is configured to handle up to 20 concurrent connections.
Since one connection should not last long, if all 20 connections are
in use, the next connection will close the oldest connection data
has been read. This way this program is not very vulnerable to so
called `denial of service' attack, thus making this ideal "identd"
to be used in a firewall, IP masquerading hosts etc.
