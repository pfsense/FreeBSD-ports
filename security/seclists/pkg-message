Warning: the file Payloads/File-Names/max-length/232A.php.gif has not been
installed with its original name due to technical limitations of pkg.
If you want to use this file, you need to copy it and to name
the copy by replacing the string "232A" with 232 times the single character
"A", then add the ".php.gif" extension.

The need for this workaround is only temporary and it should be removed from the
port soon.
