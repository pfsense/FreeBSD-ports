SecLists is the security tester's companion. It is a collection of multiple
types of lists used during security assessments, collected in one place. List
types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing
payloads, web shells, and many more. The goal is to enable a security tester to
pull this repository onto a new testing box and have access to every type of
list that may be needed.

This project is maintained by Daniel Miessler, Jason Haddix, and g0tmi1k.
