Super is a setuid-root program that offers:

    o  restricted setuid-root access to executables, adjustable
	on a per-program and per-user basis;

    o  a relatively secure environment for scripts, so that well-written
	scripts can be run as root (or some other uid/gid), without
	unduly compromising security.

The design philosophy behind super is two-fold:

    (a) some users can be trusted when executing certain commands;
    (b) there are some commands, such as a script to mount CDROM's,
	which you'd like to be safely executable even by users who
	are NOT trusted.  Although setuid-root scripts are insecure,
	a good setuid-root wrapper around a sensible non-setuid script
	can be hard to break, and super provides that wrapper so that
	even a non-trusted user can use the scripts.
