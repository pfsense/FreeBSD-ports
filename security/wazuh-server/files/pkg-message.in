Wazuh server components were installed

1) Wazuh server componenets are based on Wazuh manager and Filebeat projects.
   This guide help you to adapt wazuh configuration for it works on FreeBSD
   using apps are part of ports tree. We are using an alternative way to
   configure wazuh server components on FreeBSD. It is necessary configure
   logstash between filebeat and opensearch because FreeBSD does not include
   versions lesser or equal to 7.16.x of Filebeat into ports tree.

2) Do not forget take a look to wazuh-manager post install message to configure
   the wazuh-server component.

   # pkg info -D -x wazuh-manager | less

3) Copy %%PREFIX%%/etc/wazuh-server/filebeat.yml to %%PREFIX%%/etc/beats/
   directory

4) Copy %%PREFIX%%/etc/wazuh-server/logstash.yml and %%PREFIX%%/etc/wazuh-server/wazuh-template.json
   files to %%PREFIX%%/etc/logstash/ directory

5) You can use my own version of wazuh certificates generator for generate
   root, admin, indexer, server and dashboard certificates used by wazuh
   components.

   https://people.freebsd.org/~acm/ports/wazuh/wazuh-gen-certs.tar.gz

6) Edit filebeat.yml and logstash.yml files and changes options accord to your
   setup. For example host, ssl, filter, etc. Sample files can give you a good
   guide about that.

7) Install logstash-output-opensearch plugin

   # cd %%PREFIX%%/logstash/bin
   # sh -c "JAVA_HOME=%%PREFIX%%/openjdk11 ./logstash-plugin install logstash-output-opensearch"

8) Check if logstash-output-opensearch plugin was installed

   # sh -c "JAVA_HOME=%%PREFIX%%/openjdk11 ./logstash-plugin list | grep logstash-output-opensearch"

9) Add Filebeat and Logstash to /etc/rc.conf

   # sysrc filebeat_enable="YES"
   # sysrc logstash_enable="YES"

10) Start Filebeat and Logstash services
   
   # service filebeat start
   # service logstash start

11) You can look more useful information at the following link:

    https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-server/step-by-step.html

    Take on mind wazuh arquitecture on FreeBSD is configurated not similar like
    you can read at wazuh guide. Some times you could decided configure logstash
    on another host. If it is your case you must adapt some points in this guide.

12) Enjoy it
