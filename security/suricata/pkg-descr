The Suricata Engine is an Open Source Next Generation Intrusion Detection and
Prevention Engine developed by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF).

This engine is not intended to just replace or emulate the existing tools in
the industry, but will bring new ideas and technologies to the field.

OISF is part of and funded by the Department of Homeland Security's Directorate
for Science and Technology HOST program (Homeland Open Security Technology),
by the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), as well as
through the very generous support of the members of the OISF Consortium.

More information about the Consortium is available, as well as a list of our
current Consortium Members.
