crowdsec-firewall-bouncer is installed.

If you are running crowdsec on this machine, the bouncer will register itself with
the Local API when it's started the first time.

If the LAPI is on another machine, you need to manually register the bouncer
and fill api_key and api_url in %%ETCDIR%%/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.yaml before
starting the service.

This package depends on the Packet Filter service.
To make sure it's active:

----------
# sysrc pf_enable=YES
pf_enable: NO -> YES
# service pf start
Enabling pf.
----------

Add the following in /etc/pf.conf to create the firewall tables and rules:

----------
table <crowdsec-blacklists> persist
table <crowdsec6-blacklists> persist
block drop in quick from <crowdsec-blacklists> to any
block drop in quick from <crowdsec6-blacklists> to any
----------

To apply the file:

# pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

Then activate the bouncer via sysrc and run it:

----------
# sysrc crowdsec_firewall_enable="YES"
crowdsec_firewall_enable: NO -> YES
# service crowdsec_firewall start
----------

EOM
