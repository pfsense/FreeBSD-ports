SSLyze is a fast and powerful SSL/TLS scanning tool and Python library.

SSLyze can analyze the SSL/TLS configuration of a server by connecting to it, in
order to ensure that it uses strong encryption settings (certificate, cipher
suites, elliptic curves, etc.), and that it is not vulnerable to known TLS
attacks (Heartbleed, ROBOT, OpenSSL CCS injection, etc.).
