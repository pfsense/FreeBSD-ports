Crypt::OpenSSL::Guess provides helpers to guess OpenSSL include path on any
platforms.

Often MacOS's homebrew OpenSSL cause a problem on installation due to include
path is not added. Some CPAN module provides to modify include path with
configure-args, but Carton or Module::CPANfile is not supported to pass
configure-args to each modules. Crypt::OpenSSL::* modules should use it on your
Makefile.PL.

This module resolves the include path by Net::SSLeay's workaround. Original code
is taken from inc/Module/Install/PRIVATE/Net/SSLeay.pm by Net::SSLeay.
