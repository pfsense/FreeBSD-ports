certipy is a simple python tool for creating certificate authorities
and certificates on the fly.

Certipy was made to simplify the certificate creation process. To that end,
Certipy exposes methods for creating and managing certificate authorities,
certificates, signing and building trust bundles.

Behind the scenes Certipy:

* Manages records of all certificates it creates
* External certs can be imported and managed by Certipy
* Maintains signing hierarchy
* Persists certificates to files with appropriate permissions
