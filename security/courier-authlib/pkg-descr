The Courier Authentication Library is a generic authentication API used
for two purposes:

1. Read the name of a mail account. Determine the local account's home
   directory, and system userid and groupid.
2. Read an account name, and a password. If valid, determine the
   account's home directory, system userid, and groupid.
