step is a zero trust swiss army knife that integrates with step-ca for
automated certificate management. It's an easy-to-use and hard-to-misuse utility
for building, operating, and automating systems that use zero trust technologies
like authenticated encryption (X.509, TLS), single sign-on (OAuth OIDC, SAML),
multi-factor authentication (OATH OTP, FIDO U2F), encryption mechanisms (JSON
Web Encryption, NaCl), and verifiable claims (JWT, SAML assertions).
