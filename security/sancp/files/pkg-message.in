A startup script was installed in %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/.  Enable the script
in /etc/rc.conf using the usual rc.subr syntax.  See rc.conf(5) or go to
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/configtuning-rcng.html

Configuration files named sancp.conf.sample and sancp.conf
were installed in %%PREFIX%%/etc.  See the INSTALL doc, located in
%%PREFIX%%/share/doc/sancp/ for details on configuration
options or type "sancp -h" on the commandline.

Note that if you are installing sancp for use with sguil, you should use the
the one that came with sguil in %%PREFIX%%/etc/sguil-sensor directory.

If you're running sguil, you probably want to use at least the following flags:
sancp_flags="-D -P -R -u sancp -g sancp -d /var/log/sancp -c %%PREFIX%%/etc/sguil-sensor/sancp.conf"
