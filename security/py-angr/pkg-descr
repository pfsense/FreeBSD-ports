angr is a platform-agnostic binary analysis framework in a form of a suite
of Python 3 libraries that let you load a binary and do a lot of cool things
to it:

- Disassembly and intermediate-representation lifting
- Program instrumentation
- Symbolic execution
- Control-flow analysis
- Data-dependency analysis
- Value-set analysis (VSA)
- Decompilation

The most common angr operation is loading a binary:

    p = angr.Project('/bin/bash')

If you do this in an enhanced REPL like IPython, you can use tab-autocomplete
to browse the top-level-accessible methods and their docstrings.

angr is brought to you by the Computer Security Lab at UC Santa Barbara, SEFCOM
at Arizona State University, their associated CTF team, Shellphish, the open
source community, and @rhelmot.
