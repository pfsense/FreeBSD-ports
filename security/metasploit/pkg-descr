The Metasploit Framework

The Metasploit Framework is an open source platform that supports
vulnerability research, exploit development, and the creation of
custom security tools.  The goal is to provide useful information
to people who perform penetration testing, IDS signature development,
and exploit research. This site was created to fill the gaps in the
information publicly available on various exploitation techniques
and to create a useful resource for exploit developers. The tools
and information on this site are provided for legal penetration
testing and research purposes only.
