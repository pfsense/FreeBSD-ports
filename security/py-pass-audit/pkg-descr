pass audit is a password-store extension for auditing your password repository.
Passwords will be checked against the Python implementation of Dropbox' zxcvbn
algorithm and Troy Hunt's Have I Been Pwned Service. It supports safe breached
password detection from haveibeenpwned.com using a K-anonymity method. Using
this method, you do not need to (fully) trust the server that stores the
breached password. You should read the security consideration section for more
information.
