pkcs11-tools is a toolkit containing a bunch of small utilities to perform key
management tasks on cryptographic tokens implementing a PKCS#11 interface. It
features a number of commands similar to the unix CLI utilities, such as ls, mv,
rm, od, and more. It also has specific commands to generate keys, generate CSRs,
import certificates and other files, in a fashion compatible with most
implementations, including both IBM and Oracle JVMs.
