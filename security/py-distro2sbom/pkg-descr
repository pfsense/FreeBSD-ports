The DISTRO2SBOM generates a SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for either an
installed application or a complete system installation in a number of
formats including SPDX and CycloneDX.

An SBOM for an installed package will identify all of its dependent components.

It is intended to be used as part of a continuous integration system to enable
accurate records of SBOMs to be maintained and also to support subsequent
audit needs to determine if a particular component (and version)
has been used.
