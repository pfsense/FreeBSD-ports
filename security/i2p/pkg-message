The wrapper and rc script are currently broken and under review,
so you have to install and run i2p in the following way:

- Install security/i2p port (which you might have now)
- As normal user run /usr/local/sbin/i2prouter install (root is not allowed)
  to extract all data into $HOME/i2p.
- Go to users home i2p/ and edit runplain.sh to map I2PTEMP to the same 
  directory as I2P
- Now you can start the process in I2P home directory with ./runplain.sh

You first have to walk through an initial setup via 

http://localhost:7657

Follow the instructions and map your browser to the configured ports.
You can also host hidden services and many more via the UI.
