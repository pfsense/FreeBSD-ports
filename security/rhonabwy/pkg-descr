Rhonabwy library is made to manage JWK, JWKS, JWS, JWE and JWT according to
their respective RFCs:
- JSON Web Keys (JWK) and JSON Web Keys Set (JWKS)
- JSON Web Signatures (JWS)
- JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
- JSON Web Token (JWT)

Rhonabwy is based on the following libraries and actively uses them:
- GnuTLS for the cryptographic functions
- Jansson for the JSON manipulation
- Yder for the logs
- Libcurl when it requires to retrieve keys from an URL

When relevant, a function can accept or return GnuTLS or Jansson data. But if
you're not using those in your application and prefer raw data, you can use the
more agnostic functions.
