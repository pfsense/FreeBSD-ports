ipguard listens network for ARP packets. All permitted MAC-IP pairs
listed in 'ethers' file. If it recieves one with MAC-IP pair, which is
not listed in 'ethers' file, it will send ARP reply with configured
fake address. This will prevent not permitted host to work properly in
local ethernet segment.
