## sudoers file.
##
## This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
## Failure to use 'visudo' may result in syntax or file permission errors
## that prevent sudo from running.
##
## See the sudoers man page for the details on how to write a sudoers file.

## Defaults specification
##
## Preserve editor environment variables for visudo.
## To preserve these for all commands, remove the "!visudo" qualifier.
Defaults!/usr/local/sbin/visudo env_keep += "SUDO_EDITOR EDITOR VISUAL"
##
## Use a hard-coded PATH instead of the user's to find commands.
## This also helps prevent poorly written scripts from running
## arbitrary commands under sudo.
Defaults secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
##
## Uncomment if needed to preserve environmental variables related to the
## FreeBSD pkg utility and fetch.
# Defaults     env_keep += "PKG_CACHEDIR PKG_DBDIR FTP_PASSIVE_MODE"
##
## Additionally uncomment if needed to preserve environmental variables
## related to portupgrade
# Defaults     env_keep += "PORTSDIR PORTS_INDEX PORTS_DBDIR PACKAGES PKGTOOLS_CONF"
##
## You may wish to keep some of the following environment variables
## when running commands via sudo.
##
## Locale settings
# Defaults env_keep += "LANG LANGUAGE LINGUAS LC_* _XKB_CHARSET"
##
## X11 resource path settings
# Defaults env_keep += "XAPPLRESDIR XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH"
##
## Desktop path settings
# Defaults env_keep += "QTDIR KDEDIR"
##
## Allow sudo-run commands to inherit the callers' ConsoleKit session
# Defaults env_keep += "XDG_SESSION_COOKIE"
##
## Uncomment to enable special input methods.  Care should be taken as
## this may allow users to subvert the command being run via sudo.
# Defaults env_keep += "XMODIFIERS GTK_IM_MODULE QT_IM_MODULE QT_IM_SWITCHER"
##
## Uncomment to disable "use_pty" when running commands as root.
## Commands run as non-root users will run in a pseudo-terminal,
## not the user's own terminal, to prevent command injection.
# Defaults>root !use_pty
##
