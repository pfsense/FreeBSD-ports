This module provides a single command for generating random password
that is close enough to a real word that it is easy to remember.  It
does this by using the frequency of letter combinations in a language
(the frequency table is generated during installation although multiple
tables can be generated and used for different languages).

This module should not be used for high security applications (such as
user accounts) since it returns passwords that are not mixed case, have
no punctuation and no letters. This word can be used as a basis for a
more secure password.

The language of the password depends on the language used to construct
the frequency table.
