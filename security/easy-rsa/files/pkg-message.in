NOTE: easyrsa will require you to initialize a PKI upon first use.

ONLY for the very first run for a new PKI, do something such as this,
assuming you will have its data in $HOME/my_new_pki:

  easyrsa --pki-dir=$HOME/my_new_pki init-pki # DANGEROUS - DESTROYS ~/my_new_pki

See %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/easy-rsa/README.quickstart.md for further information.

An on-line help is available, you can run:

  easyrsa help          # for help on commands
  easyrsa help options  # for help on options
