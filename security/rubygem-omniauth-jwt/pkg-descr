JSON Web Token (JWT) is a simple way to send verified information between two
parties online. This can be useful as a mechanism for providing Single Sign-On
(SSO) to an application by allowing an authentication server to send a validated
claim and log the user in. This is how Zendesk does SSO, for example.

OmniAuth::JWT provides a clean, simple wrapper on top of JWT so that you can
easily implement this kind of SSO either between your own applications or allow
third parties to delegate authentication.
