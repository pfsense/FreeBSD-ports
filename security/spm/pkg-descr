spm is a single fully POSIX shell compliant script utilizing gpg2(1) in
combination with basic tools such as find(1) and tree(1). Passwords are
stored as PGP encrypted files with directories funtioning as (sub)groups.
spm reads/writes passwords via standard input/output allowing you to build
flexible and powerful management tools. Refer to the manual page for
various examples or read its source code to see how it works.
