OSS implementation of the TCG TPM2 Software Stack (TSS2)
* libtss2-fapi - Feature API (FAPI) as described in the TSS 2.0 Feature API
  Specification and TSS 2.0 JSON Data Types and Policy Language Specification.

* libtss2-esys - Enhanced System API (ESAPI) as described in the TSS 2.0
  This API is a 1-to-1 mapping of the TPM2 commands documented in Part 3 of the
  TPM2 specification. Additionally there are asynchronous versions of each
  command. In addition to SAPI, the ESAPI performs tracking of meta data for
  TPM object and automatic calculation of session authorization and encryption.

* libtss2-sys - System API (SAPI) as described in the system level API and TPM
  command transmission interface specification. This API is a 1-to-1 mapping of
  the TPM2 commands documented in Part 3 of the TPM2 specification.

* libtss2-mu - Marshaling/Unmarshaling (MU) as described in the TCG TSS 2.0
  Marshaling/Unmarshaling API Specification. This API provides a set of
  marshaling and unmarshaling functions for all data types define by the TPM2
  library specification.

* TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI) that is described in the same
  specification. This API provides a standard interface to transmit/receive
  TPM command/response buffers.
