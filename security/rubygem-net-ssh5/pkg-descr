Net::SSH is a pure-Ruby implementation of the SSH2 client protocol. It
supports the following features:

 - User authentication via explicit username/password, or using a
   public-key/private-key pair.
 - Port forwarding, both from the local host to a remote computer via
   the remote host, and from the remote host to the local host.
 - Execute processes on the remote machine, both interactively and
   non-interactively ("batch").
