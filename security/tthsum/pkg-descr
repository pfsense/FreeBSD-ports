tthsum generates and checks TTH checksums (root of the THEX hash tree).

The Merkle Hash Tree is a hash construct that exhibits desirable properties for
verifying the integrity of files and file subranges in an incremental or
out-of-order fashion.

The tool uses the Tiger hash algorithm for both the internal and the leaf
nodes, and has an interface identical to md5sum.
