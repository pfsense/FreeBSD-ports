The Update Framework (TUF) is a framework for secure content delivery
and updates. It protects against various types of supply chain attacks
and provides resilience to compromise.

The Update Framework (TUF) design helps developers maintain the security
of a software update system, even against attackers that compromise the
repository or signing keys. TUF provides a flexible specification
defining functionality that developers can use in any software update
system or re-implement to fit their needs.
