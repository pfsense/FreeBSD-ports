The seccure toolset implements a selection of asymmetric algorithms
based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). In particular it offers
public key encryption / decryption, signature  generation /
verification and key establishment.

ECC schemes offer a much better key size to security ratio than
classical systems (RSA, DSA). Keys are short enough to make direct
specification of keys on the command line possible (sometimes this
is more convenient than the management of PGP-like key rings).
seccure builds on this feature and therefore is the tool of choice
whenever lightweight asymmetric cryptography -- independent of key
servers, revocation certificates, the Web of Trust or even
configuration files -- is required.
