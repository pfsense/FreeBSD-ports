certmgr is a tool for managing certificates using CFSSL. It does the
following:

 - Ensures certificates are present.
 - Renews certificates before they expire.
 - Triggering a service reload or restart on certificate updates.

It operates on certificate specs, which are JSON files containing the
information needed to generate a certificate.
