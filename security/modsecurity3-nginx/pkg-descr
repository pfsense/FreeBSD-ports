The ModSecurity-nginx connector is the connection point between Nginx and libmodsecurity
(ModSecurity v3). Said another way, this project provides a communication channel between Nginx
and libmodsecurity. This connector is required to use LibModSecurity with Nginx.

The ModSecurity-nginx connector takes the form of an Nginx module.
The module simply serves as a layer of communication between Nginx and ModSecurity.

Notice that this project depends on libmodsecurity rather than ModSecurity (version 2.9 or less).
