Important Note:

Snort changed the way rules are published. Since June 2010 Snort
stop offering rules in the "snortrules-snapshot-CURRENT" format.

Instead, rules will be released for specific Snort versions.
You will be responsible for downloading the correct rules release
for your version of Snort.

The new versioning mechanism will require a four digit version in the
file name. To get the new download naming schema visit snort.org,
and look at 'My Account' -> 'Subscriptions and Oinkcodes'
