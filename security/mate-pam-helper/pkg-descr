mate-pam-helper is replacement for pam_helper for the new mate-screensaver.
It is a small utility which allows non-PAM, or non-setuid applications to
make use of PAM's authentication services.  It was mainly created to allow
gnome-screensaver to make use of PAM, but any application could use it. It
accepts two arguments, the PAM service name, and a username. It reads the
user's password from stdin.
