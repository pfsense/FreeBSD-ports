WARNING:
This port was formerly known as sysutils/swatch and was renamed to swatchdog,
the executable was renamed from swatch to swatchdog and the startup script
too.

This means you need to update all settings in rc.conf, e.g.,

swatch_enable="YES" => swatchdog_enable="YES"
swatch_rules="1 2 3" => swatchdog_rules="123"

etc.
EOM
