Certmonger is primarily concerned with getting you or your system
enrolled with a certificate authority (CA) and keeping you enrolled.

To do this, the certmonger daemon runs in the background, taking guidance from
client tools (via a D-Bus API, a command-line tool is provided which uses it).

The daemon:

    can generate key pairs if you don't already have one
    can use a key pair to generate a certificate signing request
    can submit the signing request to a CA
    can wait for the CA to decide whether or not to issue the certificate
    can store an issued certificate in a specified location
    can monitor the certificate to see if it's about to expire
    can warn you or simply log that a certificate is about to expire
    can attempt to get a new certificate when a certificate is about to expire

The goal is to have certmonger do what you need it to do based on what you've
told it you need.  If you already have a certificate, it will be happy to just
check on it periodically and warn you when it's about to expire. If you tell it
where the private key is, and where the CA is, it can go ahead and try to
re-enroll if you like.

Keys and certificates can be stored and read in any of these formats:

    PEM-formatted files
    NSS database (dbm or sql)
