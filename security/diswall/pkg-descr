Diswall (distributed firewall) - a client of distributed firewall working on
many servers and using NATS for the transport level.
Its purpose - blocking IPs with a blink of the eye on all servers in any
infrastructure when some IP checks any of the closed ports of anyone of these
servers.  Therefore, diswall provides good protection of whole infrastructure
(as anti-shodan) preventing intruder to get any system information.
