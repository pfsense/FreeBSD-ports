Some commonly used Perl modules don't have SSL support at all, even if the
protocol supports it. Others have SSL support, but most of them don't do proper
checking of the server's certificate.

The Net::SSLGlue::* modules try to add SSL support or proper certificate
checking to these modules. Currently support for the following modules is
available:
- Net::SMTP - add SSL from beginning or using STARTTLS
- Net::POP3 - add SSL from beginning or using STLS
- Net::FTP - add SSL and IPv6 support to Net::FTP
- Net::LDAP - add proper certificate checking
- LWP - add proper certificate checking

There is also a Net::SSLGlue::Socket package which combines SSL and non-SSL and
IPv6 capabilities to make it easier to enhance modules based on
IO::Socket::INET.
