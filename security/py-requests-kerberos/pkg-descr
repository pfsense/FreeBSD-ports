An authentication handler for using Kerberos with Python Requests.

Requests is an HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings. This
library adds optional Kerberos/GSSAPI authentication support and supports
mutual authentication. Basic GET usage:

>>> import requests
>>> from requests_kerberos import HTTPKerberosAuth
>>> r = requests.get("http://example.org", auth=HTTPKerberosAuth())
...
The entire requests.api should be supported.
