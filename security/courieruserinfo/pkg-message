NOTES FOR RUNNING COURIERUSERINFO

In order to use courieruserinfo, it must be able to access the
authdaemon domain socket, named 'socket'. When courieruserinfo runs as
root, this presents no problem. However, if you need to run courieruserinfo
as a non-root user, you have three options, all of which require some
manual work.

Option 1: Add the user courieruserinfo will run as to the group that
owns the authdaemon socket directory in /etc/group. More than one user
can be added to the group vector in this way. This arrangement works
well if courieruserinfo will be run by only a small number of users.
If the authdaemon socket directory is owned by courier:courier and you
run courieruserinfo as user vmail, your /etc/group file will have a line
something like this:

    courier:x:465:vmail

Option 2: Some programs, such as tcpserver, allow you to separately set
the uid and gid of programs they call but don't honour the group vector
found in /etc/group. If you invoke courieruserinfo from such a program,
set the gid to the group ownership of the authdaemon socket directory.

Option 3: Change the permissions on courieruserinfo to set gid to the
group ownership of the socket directory. Again, if the socket directory
is owned by courier:courier, change the ownership and permissions
of courieruserinfo like so:

    chgrp courier courieruserinfo
    chmod g+s courieruserinfo

Be aware that this will allow any user on the system to access user
account information through courieruserinfo.

To mitigate possible security risks posed by running courieruserinfo
setgid, courieruserinfo cannot retrieve passwords.

The location of the authdaemon domain socket is listed in the
authdaemonrc configuration file as the parameter authdaemonvar.
