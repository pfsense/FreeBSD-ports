I wanted to incorporate a method to get an SSL certificate from a server, show
the user the same kind of information as you'd see in a browser, prompt them for
validity, then write it to disk for use in all requests to a server.

I was unable to find any great / easy ways that incorporated all of these
concepts into one neat thing. So I made a thing.

Originally this was based off of yet another lovely over-engineered solution in
get-ca-py by Josh Peak.
