SoftHSM is an implementation of a cryptographic store accessible
through a PKCS #11 interface. You can use it to explore PKCS #11
without having a Hardware Security Module. It is being developed
as a part of the OpenDNSSEC project. SoftHSM Version 2 is using
openssl for its cryptographic operations.
