Snort uses rcNG startup script and must be enabled via /etc/rc.conf
Please see %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/snort
for list of available variables and their description.
Configuration files are located in %%PREFIX%%/etc/snort directory.

Please note that, by default, snort will truncate packets larger than the
default snaplen of 15158 bytes.  Additionally, LRO may cause issues with
Stream5 target-based reassembly.  It is recommended to disable LRO, if
your card supports it.

This can be done by appending '-lro' to your ifconfig_ line in rc.conf.
