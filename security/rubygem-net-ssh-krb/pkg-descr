Add Kerberos (password-less) authentication capabilities to Net::SSH, without
the need for modifying Net::SSH source code.

This is a great way to help get Capistrano to be accepted in mid-to-large size
enterprises with strict security rules.

No more getting locked out of the network because you mis-typed your password -
even if your company prohibits public key or host-based authentication. If your
organization uses Kerberos (many mid-to-large size corporations do), you can
use this package to get password-less authentication without breaking your
company's security guidelines.
