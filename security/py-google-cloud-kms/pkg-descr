Google Cloud Key Management Service: a cloud-hosted key management
service that lets you manage cryptographic keys for your cloud
services the same way you do on-premises. You can generate, use,
rotate, and destroy AES256, RSA 2048, RSA 3072, RSA 4096, EC P256, and
EC P384 cryptographic keys. Cloud KMS is integrated with Cloud IAM and
Cloud Audit Logging so that you can manage permissions on individual
keys and monitor how these are used. Use Cloud KMS to protect secrets
and other sensitive data that you need to store in Google Cloud
Platform.
