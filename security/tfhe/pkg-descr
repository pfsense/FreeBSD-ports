TFHE is open-source software. The scheme is described in the paper
"Faster fully homomorphic encryption: Bootstrapping in less than 0.1 seconds"
presented at the IACR conference Asiacrypt 2016 by Ilaria Chillotti,
Nicolas Gama, Mariya Georgieva, Malika Izabachene.

The Fully Homomorphic Encryption is a cryptosystem that supports arbitrary
computation on ciphertexts. It may be used by banks to perform computations on
fully encrypted client information.
