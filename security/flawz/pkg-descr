flawz is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) for browsing the security
vulnerabilities (also known as CVEs).

As default it uses the vulnerability database NVD (https://nvd.nist.gov)
from NIST and provides search and listing functionalities in the terminal with
different theming options.

For example, to view details on the notorious 'xz vulnerability', use:
$ flawz --feeds 2024 --query xz
