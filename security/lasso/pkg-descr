Lasso is a free software C library aiming to implement the Liberty Alliance
standards; it defines processes for federated identities, single sign-on and
related protocols.  Lasso is built on top of libxml2, XMLSec and OpenSSL and
is licensed under the GNU General Public License (with an OpenSSL exception).

Lasso first focused on implementing the Liberty Alliance ID-FF 1.2 protocols.
It now supports a good part of ID-WSF, and SAML 2.0 support has also been
completed.
