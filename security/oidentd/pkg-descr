From the README:

"oidentd is an ident (rfc1413 compliant) daemon that runs on Linux,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris.  oidentd can handle IP masqueraded/NAT connections
on Linux, FreeBSD (ipf only) and OpenBSD.  oidentd has a flexible mechanism for
specifying ident responses.  Users can be granted permission to specify their
own ident responses.  Responses can be specified according to host and port
pairs."

FreeBSD's inetd has a built-in ident service which can also generate
bogus responses.

Please see the TODO file for more information on why only ipf is
supported under FreeBSD.
