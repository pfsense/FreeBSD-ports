Authen::Captcha provides an object oriented interface to captcha file
creations.  Captcha stands for Compl etely Automated Public Turning test
to tell Computers and Humans Apart. A Captcha is a program that can
generate and grade tests that:

	- most humans can pass
	- current computer programs can't pass

The most common form is an image file containing distorted text, which
humans are adept at reading, and co mputers (generally) do a poor job.
This module currently implements that method.
