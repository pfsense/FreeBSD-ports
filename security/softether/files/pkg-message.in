Initial and further configuration of all SoftEther services can be
done either by using VPN Client/Server/Bridge Manager for Windows
or by vpncmd from command line.

Please note client functionality is currently not supported in this

as VPN client.

When removing SoftEther VPN without the desire to reinstall, please
ensure to remove the following directories as well:
- %%SE_DBDIR%%
- %%SE_LOGDIR%%
- %%SE_PIDDIR%%
