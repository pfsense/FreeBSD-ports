GnuPG keys of Debian Developers and Maintainers

The Debian project wants developers to digitally sign the announcements
of their packages with GnuPG, to protect against forgeries. This package
contains keyrings of GnuPG and keys of Debian Developers (uploading and
non-uploading), as well as of Debian Maintainers.
