plog is a parser for the logged output of the ipmon utility that is part
of the excellent IP-Filter packet-filtering and NAT package written and
maintained by Darren Reed. plog translates the somewhat garbled output
from ipmon into a report that aids analysis of your firewall traffic.
The current version number is 0.10.
