Self Encrypting Drive utility.

This allows encrypting and decrypting drives that use encryption based on
the various TCG (Trusted Computing Group) specifications.

From the web site:

   The Drive Trust Alliance software (sedutil) is an Open Source (GPLv3)
   effort to make Self Encrypting Drive technology freely available to
   everyone. It is a combination of the two known available Open Source code
   bases today: msed and OpalTool.

   The DTA Open Source can be employed freely not only for higher security
   applications but also for integration in embedded applications such as
   Automotive, Aerospace, Home Automation, and everywhere where the Data
   Leakage problem has already become obvious and where it will be obvious.
   The storage device suppliers are already gearing to give you
   self-encrypting storage. All you have to do is work with them.
