  message: <<EOM
Now that PEDA is installed it can be used with gdb(1).

Run the following command in the gdb prompt to load the plugin:

```
source %%LIBEXECDIR%%/%%UTILITY_NAME%%
```

In order to load PEDA automatically on gdb(1) launch add the line mentioned
above to ~/.gdbinit:

```
echo "source %%LIBEXECDIR%%/%%UTILITY_NAME%%" >> ~/.gdbinit
```

Keep in mind that PEDA requires at least GDB 7.0 to work.
