MD5 sums (see RFC 1321 - The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm) are used as a
one-way hash of data. Due to the nature of the formula used, it is impossible
to reverse it.
This module provides functions to search several online MD5 hashes database and
return the results (or return undefined if no match found).
