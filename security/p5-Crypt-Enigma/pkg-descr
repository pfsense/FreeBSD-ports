This module is a complete working Perl implementation of the Enigma Machine
used during World War II. The cipher calculations are based on actual Enigma
values and the resulting ciphered values are as would be expected from an
Enigma Machine.
The implementation allows for all of the Rotors and Reflectors available to the
real world Enigma to be used. A Steckerboard has also been implemented,
allowing letter substitutions to be made.
