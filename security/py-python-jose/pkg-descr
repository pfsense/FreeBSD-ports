python-jose provides a JOSE implementation in Python.

The JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) technologies - JSON Web
Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), JSON Web Key (JWK), and JSON Web
Algorithms (JWA) - collectively can be used to encrypt and/or sign content using
a variety of algorithms. While the full set of permutations is extremely large,
and might be daunting to some, it is expected that most applications will only
use a small set of algorithms to meet their needs.
