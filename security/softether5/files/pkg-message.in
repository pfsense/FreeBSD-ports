Initial and further configuration of all SofEther services can be
done either by using VPN Client/Server/Bridge Manager for Windows
or by vpncmd from command line.

Now client functionality practically works on FreeBSD!

ensure to remove the following directories as well:
- %%SE_DBDIR%%
- %%SE_LOGDIR%%
- %%SE_PIDDIR%%
