NCrypt is intended to give you security in an insecure environment.
If you are wanting to encrypt files (particularly on a multi-user
system where you don't have root), wishing to hide your activites
from prying eyes, and want to "cover your tracks", then NCrypt is
for you. It is a symmetrical file encryptor/decryptor that gives
you the choice of the top three candidates for AES as the encryption
algorithm (Rijndael, Serpent, Twofish), tries to minimize exposure
of the plaintext password in memory, and can safely erase the
plaintext version from the hard drive. It compiles without any extra
crypto libraries, making it ideal for systems where you just have
a compiler and basic libraries (such as an ISP's shell server).
