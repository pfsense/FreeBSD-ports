To use doas,

%%PREFIX%%/etc/doas.conf

must be created. Refer to doas.conf(5) for further details and/or follow
%%PREFIX%%/etc/doas.conf.sample as an example.

Note: In order to be able to run most desktop (GUI) applications, the user
needs to have the keepenv keyword specified. If keepenv is not specified then
key elements, like the user's $HOME variable, will be reset and cause the GUI
application to crash.

Users who only need to run command line applications can usually get away
without keepenv.

When in doubt, try to avoid using keepenv as it is less secure to have
environment variables passed to privileged users.
