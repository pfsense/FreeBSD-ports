This is a Java SSH Client, which has a whole bunch of features,
but supports SSH Protocol 1 connections only.

This version does not depend on the Java Development Kit, since
it is the binary version, which runs out-of-the-box in
webbrowsers that support Java.  A minimal sample HTML page
is installed as well.
If you want to use the client from shell, you have to install
the JDK first (${PORTSDIR}/java/jdk/).

A commercial version for SSH-2 is available here:
(This version is no longer supported)
