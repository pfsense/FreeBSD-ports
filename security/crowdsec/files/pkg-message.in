crowdsec is installed.

Note: If you are using OPNsense or pfSense, ignore the following instructions and use the settings page of the
CrowdSec plugin.

-----

You need to check/edit the following files in %%ETCDIR%% as described in https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/configuration/crowdsec_configuration

 - config.yaml: main configuration
 - acquis.yaml, acquis.d: datasource configuration (this port does not include automatic discovery of the running services)
 - profiles.yaml: remediation policies (ban, duration, etc)

Then you can enable the daemon via sysrc and run it.

# sysrc crowdsec_enable="YES"
crowdsec_enable: NO -> YES
# service crowdsec start
