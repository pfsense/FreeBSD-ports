# This dumps STDERR and STDOUT to a file and should never generate an email.
# The resulting log file shows any errors in context, which I found more useful for debugging.
# I set this file to rotate daily, since the cronjob also runs daily.
# I still get email if something goes wrong, via the SAVED_MAIL_FROM and
# SAVED_MAIL_TO options in account.conf - I also use NOTIFY_HOOK='pushover,mail'
# which requires setting SAVED_PUSHOVER_TOKEN and SAVED_PUSHOVER_USER.
