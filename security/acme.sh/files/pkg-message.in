  message: <<EOM
This script will create the following directories if they do not exist:

 ~acme/.acme.sh
 ~acme/certs

The script will also install ~acme/.acme.sh/account.conf.sample which has
sane defaults.  Copy this to ~acme/.acme.sh/account.conf and edit contents
to suit.

If you have EXAMPLES on:

* In the %%EXAMPLESDIR%% directory, you can find the dnsapi 
  scripts which will be useful if you decide to use dns-01 challenges. Also 
  included are the deploy scripts.

* A newsyslog.conf sample file is installed at 
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/acme.sh.conf - you must modify it by
  at least uncommenting the line.

* If you run `newsyslog -NC` it will create the required logfiles.

* Please review %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/acme.sh-cron.d - instructions are
  contained in that file.

Now they are installed to:

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/acme.sh.conf

You may wish to delete the old files/directory and edit the new files to
enable the log rotation. Instructions contained within.
