You can use ropper to look at information about files in different
file formats and you can find ROP and JOP gadgets to build chains for
different architectures. Ropper supports ELF, MachO and the PE file
format. Other files can be opened in RAW format. The following
architectures are supported:

- x86 / x86_64
- Mips / Mips64
- ARM (also Thumb Mode)/ ARM64
- PowerPC / PowerPC64

Ropper is inspired by ROPgadget, but should be more than a gadgets
finder. So it is possible to show information about a binary like
header, segments, sections etc. Furthermore it is possible to edit the
binaries and edit the header fields, but currently this is not fully
implemented and in a experimental state. For disassembly ropper uses
the awesome Capstone Framework.

Now you can generate rop chain automatically (auto-roper) for execve
and mprotect syscall.
