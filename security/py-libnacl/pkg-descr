This library is used to gain direct access to the functions exposed by Daniel J.
Bernstein's nacl library via libsodium. It has been constructed to maintain
extensive documentation on how to use nacl as well as being completely portable.
The file in libnacl/__init__.py can be pulled out and placed directly in any
project to give a single file binding to all of nacl.
