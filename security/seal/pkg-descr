The Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library (SEAL) is an easy-to-use but powerful
open-source homomorphic encryption library, developed by researchers in the
Cryptography Research Group at Microsoft Research. SEAL is written in standard
C++; it has no external dependencies, so it is easy to compile in many
different environments. SEAL is licensed under the MIT license.
