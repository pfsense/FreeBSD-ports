You wrote a cool network client or server. It encrypts connections
using TLS. Your test suite needs to make TLS connections to itself.

Uh oh. Your test suite probably doesn't have a valid TLS certificate.
Now what?

trustme is a tiny Python package that does one thing: it gives you
a fake certificate authority (CA) that you can use to generate fake
TLS certs to use in your tests. Well, technically they're real
certs, they're just signed by your CA, which nobody trusts. But you
can trust it. Trust me.
