The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the world's most popular free
security tools and is actively maintained by a dedicated international team
of volunteers. It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in
your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications.
It's also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security
testing.
