A script to configure transparent encryption of sensitive files stored in a Git
repository. Files that you choose will be automatically encrypted when you
commit them, and automatically decrypted when you check them out. The process
will degrade gracefully, so even people without your encryption password can
safely commit changes to the repository's non-encrypted files.

Transcrypt protects your data when it's pushed to remotes that you may not
directly control (e.g., GitHub, Dropbox clones, etc.), while still allowing you
to work normally on your local working copy. You can conveniently store things
like passwords and private keys within your repository and not have to share
them with your entire team or complicate your workflow.
