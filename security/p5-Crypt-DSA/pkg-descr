Crypt::DSA is an implementation of the DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)
signature verification system. The implementation itself is pure Perl,
although the heavy-duty mathematics underneath are provided by the
Math::Pari library.

This package provides DSA signing, signature verification, and key generation.
