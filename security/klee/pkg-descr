KLEE is a symbolic virtual machine built on top of the LLVM compiler
infrastructure.

Currently, there are two primary components:
* The core symbolic virtual machine engine; this is responsible for executing
  LLVM bitcode modules with support for symbolic values. This is comprised of
  the code in lib/.
* A POSIX/Linux emulation layer oriented towards supporting uClibc, with
  additional support for making parts of the operating system environment
  symbolic.

Additionally, there is a simple library for replaying computed inputs on native
code (for closed programs). There is also a more complicated infrastructure for
replaying the inputs generated for the POSIX/Linux emulation layer, which
handles running native programs in an environment that matches a computed test
input, including setting up files, pipes, environment variables, and passing
command line arguments.
