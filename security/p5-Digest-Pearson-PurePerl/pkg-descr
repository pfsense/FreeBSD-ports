Digest::Pearson::PurePerl is an implementation of Peter K. Pearson's hash
algorithm presented in "Fast Hashing of Variable Length Text Strings"
- ACM 1990. This hashing technique yields good distribution of hashed results
for variable length input strings on the range 0-255, and thus, it is well
suited for data load balancing.
If you prefer a fast implementation, you might want to
consider Digest::Pearson instead.
