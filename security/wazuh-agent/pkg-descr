The Wazuh agent runs on the hosts that you want to monitor.
It is multi-platform and provides the following capabilities:

- Log and data collection
- File integrity monitoring
- Rootkit and malware detection
- Security policy monitoring.
- Configuration assessments
- Software inventory

In addition, it communicates with the Wazuh manager, sending data in near
real-time through an encrypted and authenticated channel.
