Rekor's goals are to provide an immutable tamper resistant ledger of
metadata generated within a software projects supply chain. Rekor will
enable software maintainers and build systems to record signed metadata
to an immutable record.  Other parties can then query said metadata to
enable them to make informed decisions on trust and non-repudiation of
an object's lifecycle.

The Rekor project provides a restful API based server for validation and
a transparency log for storage. A CLI application is available to make
and verify entries, query the transparency log for inclusion proof,
integrity verification of the transparency log or retrieval of entries
by either public key or artifact.

Rekor fulfils the signature transparency role of sigstore's software
signing infrastructure. However, Rekor can be run on its own and is
designed to be extensible to working with different manifest schemas and
PKI tooling.
