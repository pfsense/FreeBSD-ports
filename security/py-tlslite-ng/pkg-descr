tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS
cryptographic protocols. It can be used either as a standalone wrapper around
python socket interface or as a backend for multiple other libraries. tlslite-ng
is pure python, however it can use other libraries for faster crypto operations.
tlslite-ng integrates with several stdlib neworking libraries.
