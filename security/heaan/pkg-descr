HEAAN is software library that implements homomorphic encryption (HE) that
supports fixed point arithmetics. This library supports approximate
operations between rational numbers. The approximate error depends on some
parameters and almost same with floating point operation errors. The scheme in
this library is on the paper "Homomorphic Encryption for Arithmetic of
Approximate Numbers".
