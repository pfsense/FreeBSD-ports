This is a Python implementation of Macaroons. PyMacaroons is stable and does not
change frequently. Please see the GitHub issues for the current roadmap.

Macaroons, like cookies, are a form of bearer credential. Unlike opaque tokens,
macaroons embed caveats that define specific authorization requirements for the
target service, the service that issued the root macaroon and which is capable
of verifying the integrity of macaroons it receives.

Macaroons allow for delegation and attenuation of authorization. They are simple
and fast to verify, and decouple authorization policy from the enforcement of
that policy.
