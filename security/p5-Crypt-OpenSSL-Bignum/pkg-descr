Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum provides access to OpenSSL
multiprecision integer arithmetic libraries. Presently,
many though not all of the arithmetic operations that
OpenSSL provides are exposed to perl. In addition,
this module can be used to provide access to bignum
values produced by other OpenSSL modules, such as key
parameters from Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA.
