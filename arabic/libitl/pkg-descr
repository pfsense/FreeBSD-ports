The Islamic Tools and Libraries (ITL) project provides a fully
featured library for performing common Islamic calculations.

ITL is currently composed of two library-modules:

* prayertime: Geographically-aware prayer time and Qibla calculation
  routines.
* hijri: Hijri date generation/calculation and conversion routines.
