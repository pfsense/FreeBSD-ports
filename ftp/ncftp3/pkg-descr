NcFTP is a free set of programs that use the File Transfer Protocol.
The main program is simply called "ncftp".  There are also separate
utility programs for one-shot FTP operations (i.e. for shell scripts
and command line junkies);  these include "ncftpget", "ncftpput",
and "ncftpls".  Also included is a batch processing daemon,
"ncftpbatch", which is invoked by the "bgget" command from "ncftp"
and also the "-b" flag of "ncftpput" and "ncftpget".  Lastly, the
"ncftpbookmarks" program is a full-screen utility program to
manipulate user's FTP bookmarks.
