ftputil is a high-level FTP client library for the Python programming language.

ftputil implements a virtual file system for accessing FTP servers, that is,
it can generate file-like objects for remote files. The library supports many
functions similar to those in the os, os.path and shutil modules. ftputil has
convenience functions for conditional uploads and downloads, and handles FTP
clients and servers in different timezones.
