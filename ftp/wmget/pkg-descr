wmget is a dock app for the GNU Window Maker window manager which makes it more
convenient to perform long downloads in the background.

This is useful if you tend to have dozens of windows open at a time and tend to
do a lot of routine downloading. Just copy the link from your browser, middle-
click on the wmget dockapp, and the download will start. No download windows or
terminals required, and you can monitor the progress and stop the transfer if
desired without opening or raising any windows or even changing desktops.
