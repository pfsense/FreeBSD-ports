GNU wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP,
HTTPS and FTP, the most widely-used Internet protocols. It is a
non-interactive command-line tool, so it may easily be called from
scripts, cron jobs, terminals without X-Windows support, etc.

GNU wget has many features to make retrieving large files or mirroring
entire web or FTP sites easy, including:

 o Can resume aborted downloads, using REST and RANGE
 o Can use filename wild cards and recursively mirror directories
 o NLS-based message files for many different languages
 o Optionally converts absolute links in downloaded documents to
   relative, so that downloaded documents may link to each other locally
 o Supports HTTP and SOCKS proxies
 o Supports HTTP cookies
 o Supports persistent HTTP connections
 o Unattended / background operation
 o Uses local file timestamps to determine whether documents need to
   be re-downloaded when mirroring
 o GNU wget is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
