BSDftpd-ssl is the secure FTP server that supports industry standard TLS/SSL
encryption and authentication for whole FTP sessions and data transfers. This
implementation is compatible with the original FTP protocol, which is described
in RFC 959, and the TLS/SSL enhancement allows RFC 2228-compliant TLS/SSL
protection for both control and data channels.

This package contains the secure FTP server, the command-line TLS/SSL-aware FTP
client utility, an essential documentation, and also script programs for a
basic X.509 certificate management.
