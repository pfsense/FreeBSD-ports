  message: <<EOM
This port relies on a number of configuration files in %%PREFIX%%/etc.
At the very least, create a ftpusers file with the usernams of users you don't
want to connect (root, toor, etc.). This will allow non-listed users to log in.
Copying /etc/ftpusers to %%PREFIX%%/etc/ftpusers should be sufficient.

See the man pages and examples in %%EXAMPLESDIR%% for more
information. The man pages and configuration files for FreeBSD's built-in ftpd
can also be of use as examples/additional info.
