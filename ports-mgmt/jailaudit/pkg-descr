This port contains a script to generate portaudit reports for jails
running on a FreeBSD system.

Normally portaudit just creates reports for the Host-system or the jail
it is installed in. With a large number of jails running on a system,
installing and updating portaudit in every jail is time-consuming and
error-prone. Jailaudit uses pkg installed in the Host-system
to create a report for every jail.

The reports are appended to the daily security run and can be sent to a
specific mail address, which allows the Host-system administrator to
dispatch portaudit reports to the owners of jails, keeping them informed
about potential security advisories of their installed ports.

Jailaudit can be used on FreeBSD 5.1 or larger.
