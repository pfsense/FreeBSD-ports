Portfmt is a collection of tools for editing, formatting, and linting
FreeBSD Ports Collection Makefiles.

It comes with several tools:

- portfmt formats Makefiles
- portclippy is a linter that checks if variables are in the correct
  order in a more comprehensive way than portlint
- portedit edits Makefiles.  It comes with several commands
  that can be used as a basis for your own port update scripts:
  - bump-epoch: bumps PORTEPOCH or inserts it at the right place
  - bump-revision: bumps PORTREVISION or inserts it at the right place
  - get: lookup unevaluated variable values
  - merge: Generic command to set/update variables while also
    formatting the updated variables properly and inserting them
    in the right places if necessary.  Useful for merging output
    of other tools like make cargo-crates, modules2tuple, or make
    stage-qa.  For example to mark a port deprecated:

	printf "DEPRECATED=%s\nEXPIRATION_DATE=%s" \
		Abandonware 2019-08-15 | portedit merge -i Makefile

  - set-version: resets PORTREVISION, sets DISTVERSION or PORTVERSION
