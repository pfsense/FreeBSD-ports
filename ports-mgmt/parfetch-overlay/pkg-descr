Fetch distfiles in parallel and with pipelining

Ports that fetch multiple distfiles from the same host can
especially benefit from this.

This is a glue application between libcurl and the ports
framework. It comes with a ports overlay that replaces the
default do-fetch and checksum targets.

This is an experiment. Use at your own risk.
