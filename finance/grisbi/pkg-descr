Grisbi is a personnal accounting application, written with Gnome and Gtk,
and is released under the GPL licence.

Its aim is to provide you with the most simple and intuitive software for
basic use, although it can be very powerful if you spend a little time on the
setup.

Grisbi is an application written by french developpers, so it perfectly
respects french accounting rules. Grisbi can manage multiple accounts,
currencies and users. It manages third parties, expenditures and receipts
categories, and also budgetary lines, financial years, and other information
that make Grisbi adapted for associations (except those that require double
entry accounting).
