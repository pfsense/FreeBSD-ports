HomeBank is the free software you have always wanted to manage your
personal accounts at home. The main concept is to be light, simple and
very easy to use. It brings you many features that allow you to analyze
your finances in a detailed way instantly and dynamically with powerful
report tools based on filtering and graphical charts.

Furthermore, HomeBank benefits from more than 10 years of users'
experiences and feedback as its development started in 1995 on Amiga
computers. It is now available on Amiga, GNU/Linux, and will probably be
available soon for Microsoft Windows and MacOS X systems as GTK+ exists
on them.
