This is a Python wrapper for TA-LIB based on Cython instead of SWIG. From the
homepage:

TA-Lib is widely used by trading software developers requiring to perform
technical analysis of financial market data.
- Includes 150+ indicators such as ADX, MACD, RSI, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands,
  etc.
- Candlestick pattern recognition
- Open-source API for C/C++, Java, Perl, Python and 100% Managed .NET

The original Python bindings included with TA-Lib use SWIG which unfortunately
are difficult to install and aren't as efficient as they could be. Therefore
this project uses Cython and Numpy to efficiently and cleanly bind to TA-Lib --
producing results 2-4 times faster than the SWIG interface.

In addition, this project also supports the use of the Polars and Pandas
libraries.
