NAME
   Business::MaxMind::CreditCardFraudDetection - Access MaxMind minFraud
   services

ABSTRACT
   This module queries the MaxMind minFraud service and returns the
   results.  The service uses a free e-mail database, an IP address geog-
   raphy database, a bank identification number, and proxy checks to
   return a risk factor score representing the likelihood that the credit
   card transaction is fraudulent.
