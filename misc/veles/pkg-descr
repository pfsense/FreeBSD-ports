Veles is an open source tool for binary data analysis.

Features:
* Binary data visualization
  It is a very difficult task for a human to notice subtle patterns in large
  amounts of binary data, however, us humans are very good at finding patterns
  in images. Statistical visualizations let you find the important bits in a
  sea of binary data - all at a glance.

* Binary data analysis
  Veles combines advanced hex explorer and data visualization features with an
  extensible framework for binary data analysis. Reverse engineering binaries?
  Veles can support your work in these fields: reverse engineering binaries,
  exploring file system images, steganography.

* Easy extendibility
  With the number of different architectures, file formats and encodings you
  can't always expect to find the tool you need online. Veles uses client-server
  architecture, where each analyser can run in a separate process. All you need
  to do is get the data from the server, implement a Python function to parse it
  and return the results.
