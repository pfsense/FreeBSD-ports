hashdb is used for finding blacklist data in raw media by using cryptographic
hashes calculated from hash blocks.

The hashdb tool provides commands for creating hash databases of MD5 hashes on
files aligned along hash block boundaries as well as querying hash databases,
merging hash databases, and performing hash lookups.

hashdb provides C++ and Python interfaces for working with and scanning hashdb
databases.
