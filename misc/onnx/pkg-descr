Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is an open ecosystem that empowers AI
developers to choose the right tools as their project evolves. ONNX provides an
open source format for AI models, both deep learning and traditional ML. It
defines an extensible computation graph model, as well as definitions of
built-in operators and standard data types. Currently we focus on the
capabilities needed for inferencing (scoring).

ONNX is widely supported and can be found in many frameworks, tools, and
hardware. Enabling interoperability between different frameworks and
streamlining the path from research to production helps increase the speed of
innovation in the AI community. We invite the community to join us and further
evolve ONNX.
