pyct is a utility package that includes:
* pyct.cmd: Makes various commands available to other packages. The same
  commands are available from within python. Can either add new subcommands
  to an existing argparse based command if the module has an existing command,
  or create the entire command if the module has no existing command. Currently,
  there are commands for copying examples and fetching data.
* pyct.build: Provides various commands to help package building, primarily as a
  convenience for project maintainers.
