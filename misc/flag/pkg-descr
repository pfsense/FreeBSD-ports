Produces a cute little ansi colour 'flag' based off a hash of the machine's
hostname (or settable via ~/.flag or /etc/flag) which can uniquely visually
identify a machine, at a glance. Useful for placing into /etc/issue or your
bash prompt, so that you don't send stupid commands to the wrong machine.
