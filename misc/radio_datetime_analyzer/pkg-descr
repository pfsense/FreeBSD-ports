Analyzer for log files of time stations

The program takes a minimum of two parameters:

- the station name of the file to analyze (as argument to the -s option)
- the name of the file to analyze (as argument to the -f option)
The -h option provides a short help message.

Currently supported stations are dcf77 and msf. DCF77 is the German time
station at 77.5 kHz, and MSF is the British time station at 60 kHz. Some
information these stations can be found at:
