The synced_collections package provides Pythonic abstractions over various
underlying data stores, presenting APIs that behave like standard built-in
Python collections like dicts. synced_collections form the backbone of
signac's data and metadata storage, but may be used just as easily outside
of signac. For instance, users wishing to access a JSON file on disk like a
dictionary and automatically persist all changes could use the
synced_collections.JSONDict.
