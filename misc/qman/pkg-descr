Unix manual pages are lovely. They are concise, well-written,
complete, and downright useful. However, the standard way of accessing
them from the command-line hasn't changed since the early days.

Qman aims to change that. It's a modern, full-featured manual page
viewer featuring hyperlinks, web browser like navigation, a table of
contents for each page, incremental search, on-line help, and more. It
also strives to be fast and tiny, so that it can be used
everywhere. For this reason, it's been written in plain C and has only
minimal dependencies.
