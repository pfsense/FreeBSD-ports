Markov bots like Hailo and AI::MegaHAL are fun. But to get them working you
either need to train them on existing training material or make your own.

Bot::Training provides a pluggable way to install already existing training
files via the CPAN. Bot::Training also comes with a command-line interface
called bot-training.
