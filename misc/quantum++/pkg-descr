Quantum++ is a modern C++11 general purpose quantum computing library, composed
solely of template header files. Quantum++ is written in standard C++11 and has
very low external dependencies, using only the Eigen 3 linear algebra
header-only template library and, if available, the OpenMP multi-processing
library.
