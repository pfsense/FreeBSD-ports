Cstream filters data streams, much like the UNIX tool dd(1). It has a more
traditional commandline syntax, support for precise bandwidth limiting and
reporting and support for FIFOs. Data limits and throughput rate
calculation will work for files > 4 GB.

Cstream reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output, if
no filenames are given. It will also 'generate' or 'sink' data if desired.
