DART (Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit) is a collaborative,
cross-platform, open source library created by the Graphics Lab and Humanoid
Robotics Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology with ongoing contributions from
the Personal Robotics Lab at University of Washington and Open Source Robotics
Foundation. The library provides data structures and algorithms for kinematic
and dynamic applications in robotics and computer animation. DART is
distinguished by its accuracy and stability due to its use of generalized
coordinates to represent articulated rigid body systems and Featherstone's
Articulated Body Algorithm to compute the dynamics of motion.
