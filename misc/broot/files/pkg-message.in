the 'br' shell function:
========================

broot is convenient to find a directory then 'cd' to it, which is done using '<alt><enter>' 
or ':cd'.

But broot needs a companion function in the shell in order to be able to change directory.

When you start broot, it checks whether the 'br# shell function seems to have been installed
(or to have been refused). If needed, and if the used shell seems compatible (supported
shells today are bash, zsh and fish), then broot asks the permission to register this shell
function.

If you have messed with the configuration files, you might want to have the shell function
reinstalled.

In order to do this, either remove all broot config files, or launch 'broot --install'.

When it's done, you can do just 'br' to launch broot, and typing '<alt><enter>' will cd for
you.
