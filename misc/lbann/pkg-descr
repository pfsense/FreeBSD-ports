The Livermore Big Artificial Neural Network toolkit (LBANN) is an open-source,
HPC-centric, deep learning training framework that is optimized to compose
multiple levels of parallelism.

LBANN provides model-parallel acceleration through domain decomposition to
optimize for strong scaling of network training. It also allows for composition
of model-parallelism with both data parallelism and ensemble training methods
for training large neural networks with massive amounts of data. LBANN is able
to advantage of tightly-coupled accelerators, low-latency high-bandwidth
networking, and high-bandwidth parallel file systems.

LBANN supports state-of-the-art training algorithms such as unsupervised,
self-supervised, and adversarial (GAN) training methods in addition to
traditional supervised learning. It also supports recurrent neural networks via
back propagation through time (BPTT) training, transfer learning, and
multi-model and ensemble training methods.
