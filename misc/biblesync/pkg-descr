This is a C++ single class library encapsulating a protocol conduit.  The
premise is that there is a local network over which to multicast Bible
navigation, and someone, possibly several someones, will transmit, and others
will receive.  The choices for when you decide to xmit and what to do when you
recv are up to you as the application designer.

Access to the conduit is by creating the object, setting the mode, calling
Transmit() to xmit nav events, and arranging the frequent polling of Receive()
to recv nav events.  There is more than just navigation to be handled; there
are live/dead events for potential Speakers as well as mismatches, presence
announcements, and errors.  There is a programming reference biblesync.7 which
explains the details, both from a high level view of the essentials of the
protocol's behavior and at a low level of how you create, access, and use the
conduit class.  The (single) BibleSync object should persist throughout the
life of your application, but at any time you can set the mode to "disable,"
and preferably stop the receive polling, and then re-enable it later as the
user needs.

Much work has been done in integrating this library into its first application,
Xiphos.  It is useful to examine Xiphos' code to see where and how integration
has been done.  Get a Xiphos source tree using:
