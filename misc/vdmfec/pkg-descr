VDMFEC implements Block ECC using a Forward Error Correction (FEC)
code based on Vandermonde (VDM) matrices in GF(2^8) due to Luigi
Rizzo.

Its primary application is intended to be in recovering data from
unreliable media such as diskettes. Another example is wrapping
'zfs send' streams before dumping onto tape.
