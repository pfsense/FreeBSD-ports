The purpose of the binbloom project is to analyse a raw binary firmware and
determine automatically some of its features. This tool is compatible with all
architectures as basically, it just does simple statistics on it.

Main features:
* Loading address: binbloom can parse a raw binary firmware and determine its
  loading address.
* Endianness: binbloom can use heuristics to determine the endianness of a
  firmware.
* UDS Database: binbloom can parse a raw binary firmware and check if it
  contains an array containing UDS command IDs.
