Spacenavd is a free software user-space driver (daemon), for 6-dof
input devices, like 3Dconnexion's space-mice. It's compatible with
the original 3dxsrv proprietary daemon provided by 3Dconnexion,
and works as a drop-in replacement with any program that was written
for the 3Dconnexion driver, but also provides an improved
communication mechanism for programs designed specifically to work
with spacenavd.
