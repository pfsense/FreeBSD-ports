SageMaker Python SDK is an open source library for training and deploying
machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker.

With the SDK, you can train and deploy models using popular deep learning
frameworks Apache MXNet and TensorFlow. You can also train and deploy models
with Amazon algorithms, which are scalable implementations of core machine
learning algorithms that are optimized for SageMaker and GPU training.

If you have your own algorithms built into SageMaker compatible Docker
containers, you can train and host models using these as well.
