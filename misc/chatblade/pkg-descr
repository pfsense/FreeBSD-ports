Chatblade is a versatile command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to interact
with OpenAI's ChatGPT. It accepts piped input, arguments, or both, and allows
you to save common prompt preambles for quick usage. Additionally, Chatblade
provides utility methods to extract JSON or Markdown from ChatGPT responses.

Note: You'll need to set up your OpenAI API key to use Chatblade.
