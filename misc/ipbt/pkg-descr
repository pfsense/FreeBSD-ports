IPBT (It's Play-Back Time) is a ttyrec player with many features
that ttyplay lacks. Notable features are:

	* Pausing
	* Move forward/backward frame by frame
	* Adjustable play speed (faster/slower)
	* Jump to beginning/end in a single keystroke
	* Searching forward/backward for a given string
	* ttygrep and ttydump utilities

IPBT works by reading the entire input file and running it through
an internal terminal emulator (the one from PuTTY).
