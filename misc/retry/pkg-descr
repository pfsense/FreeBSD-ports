Retry captures stdin into memory as the data is passed to the repeated command,
and this captured stdin is then replayed should the command be repeated. This
makes it possible to embed the retry tool into shell pipelines.

Retry captures stdout into memory, and if the command was successful stdout is
passed on to stdout as normal, while if the command was repeated stdout is
passed to stderr instead. This ensures that output is passed to stdout once and
once only.
