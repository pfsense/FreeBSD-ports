This module implements the classic Eliza algorithm. The original Eliza
program was written by Joseph Weizenbaum and described in the Communications
of the ACM in 1967. Eliza is a mock Rogerian psychotherapist. It prompts
for user input, and uses a simple transformation algorithm to change user
input into a follow-up question. The program is designed to give the
appearance of understanding.
