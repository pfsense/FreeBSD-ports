OpenNN is a software library written in C++ for advanced analytics. It
implements neural networks, the most successful machine learning method.

The main advantage of OpenNN is its high performance. This library outstands in
terms of execution speed and memory allocation. It is constantly optimized and
parallelized in order to maximize its efficiency.

Some typical applications of OpenNN are business intelligence (customer
segmentation, churn prevention...), health care (early diagnosis, microarray
analysis...) and engineering (performance optimization, predictive
maitenance...).

OpenNN does not deal with computer vision or natural language processing.
