The Model Context Protocol allows applications to provide context for LLMs in a
standardized way, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual
LLM interaction. This Python SDK implements the full MCP specification, making
it easy to:

  - Build MCP clients that can connect to any MCP server
  - Create MCP servers that expose resources, prompts and tools
  - Use standard transports like stdio and SSE
  - Handle all MCP protocol messages and lifecycle events
