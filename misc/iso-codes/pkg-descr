This project provides lists of various ISO standards (e.g. country,
language, language scripts, and currency names) in one place, rather
than repeated in many programs throughout the system.

Currently there are lists of languages and countries embedded in
several different programs, which leads to dozens of lists of
200 languages, translated into more than 90 languages ... not
very efficient.

With this project, we create a single "gettext domain" for every
supported ISO standard which contains the translations of
that domain. It is easy for a programmer to re-use those
translations instead of maintaining their own translation
infrastructure. Moreover, the programmer does not need to follow
changes in the ISO standard and will not work with outdated
information.
