You installed Netron: a neural network visualizer.

Netron displays graphical user interface through a web browser. It is
recommended that it is run through the electron (devel/electron6) browser
to be a standalone app.

In order to do this you can run it with this command line:
$ BROWSER=electron netron -b {model-file}
