The SWORD Project is the CrossWire Bible Society's free Bible
software project. Its purpose is to create cross-platform open-source
tools, covered by the GNU General Public License, that allow
programmers and Bible societies to write new Bible software more
quickly and easily. We also create Bible study software for all
readers, students, scholars, and translators of the Bible, and have
a growing collection of over 200 texts in over 50 languages.
