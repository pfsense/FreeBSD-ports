To use sword, you need to have bible, commentary and/or lexicon
modules. You can install those from the crosswire website in two
ways. If you live in a persecuted country however and do not wish
to risk detection, you should *not* try this.

  1. Use installmgr (doesn't work when port is built WITHOUT_CURL). E.g.:
     # installmgr -init
     # installmgr -r crosswire
     # installmgr -ri crosswire ASV
     See `installmgr --help` for details.
  2. Download raw zip-archives from
       http://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/
     and unpack them in %%PREFIX%%/share/sword.

You probably want to install a bible-application that uses sword,
like bibletime or xiphos.
