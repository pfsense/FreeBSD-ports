C++ Matrix: The Matrix Reloaded in Terminals (Number falls, Banners,
Matrix rains, Conway's Game of Life and Mandelbrot set)

I wrote a simple terminal program of Matrix digital rain.
A part of the purpose of this program is to test the performance
of terminal emulators. Another purpose is just for fun.
Enjoy it with fast terminals (e.g., urxvt, alacritty, terminology, etc.)!

Features

- Hankaku kana characters as in the original film
- Ten levels of "green"s using terminal 256 color support
- Twinkling effects by adding random brightness fluctuations
- Diffused reflection effects by cell background colors
