You installed OpenHantek: the client for Hantek PC-oscilloscope.

In order for OpenHantek to work you need:
1. Have a compatible device: DSO-6022, DSO-2020, etc.
2. Make sure that your USB device has permissions for your user.
   You can achieve this by adding records like this to your
   /etc/devd.conf:

notify 100 {
	match "system"		"USB";
	match "subsystem"	"DEVICE";
	match "type"		"ATTACH";
	match "vendor"	"0x04b4";
	match "product"	"0x6022";
	action "/usr/sbin/chown {your-user} /dev/usb/`echo $cdev | sed s/ugen//`.*";
};
notify 100 {
	match "system"		"USB";
	match "subsystem"	"DEVICE";
	match "type"		"ATTACH";
	match "vendor"	"0x04b5";
	match "product"	"0x6022";
	action "/usr/sbin/chown {your-user} /dev/usb/`echo $cdev | sed s/ugen//`.*";
};

The "action" above doesn't use $device-name due to:
https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=242111

Also please note that devices like this have two vendor/product id
combinations, before and after loading the firmware, hence two
commands above.
