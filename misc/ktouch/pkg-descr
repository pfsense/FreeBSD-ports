KTouch is a program for learning to touch type. It provides you with
text to train on and adjusts to different levels depending on how good
you are. It also displays which key to press next and the correct
finger to use. You learn typing with all fingers, step by step,
without having to look down at the keyboard all the time to find your
keys (which slows you down a lot). It is convenient for all ages and
the perfect typing tutor for schools, universities and individuals.
