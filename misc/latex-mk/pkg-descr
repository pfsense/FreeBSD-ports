LaTeX-Mk is a tool for managing small to large sized LaTeX projects. The
typical LaTeX-Mk input file is simply a series of variable definitions in a
Makefile for the project. After creating a simple Makefile the user can easily
perform all required steps to do such tasks as: preview the document, print
the document, or produce a PDF file. LaTeX-Mk will keep track of files that
have changed and how to run the various programs that are needed to produce
the output.
