Before running the client for the first time, be sure to:

 1. visit the Uptimes project's web site and register yourself
	(WWW: http://uptimes.hostingwired.com/newuser.php).
 2. log in (WWW: http://uptimes.hostingwired.com/login.php).
 3. Add your host (WWW: http://uptimes.hostingwired.com/account.php).
	It is very important that you do not lose the generated key
	since, for instance, they are no way to get it back by any way.

Note that in order to send your uptime information to the uptime server,
you hosts need more-or-less full-time Internet access.

You will also have to edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/upclient.conf:

  - AuthKey is the ID you've received when you added your host.
  - Interval is the amount of time between each update.
	(WWW: http://uptimes.hostingwired.com/protocol.html).
    Don't set this higher than 10 minutes, or else your host
    won't appear in the list.
  - UptimeServer is the Uptimes Project's data server, currently
    uptimes.hostingwired.com (Since the official Uptimes Project's
    server has been terminated, uptimes.wonko.com and data.uptimes.net
    must not be used anymore.  So, please, take care about that).
