RAJA is a C++ software library developed at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL) to enable performance portability for High-Performance
Computing (HPC) applications. Its primary goal is to allow developers to
write a single version of their code that can be compiled and run
efficiently on diverse hardware architectures and programming models,
such as GPUs using CUDA or OpenMP.
