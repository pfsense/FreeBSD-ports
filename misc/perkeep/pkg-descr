Perkeep (nee Camlistore) is a set of open source formats, protocols, and
software for modeling, storing, searching, sharing and synchronizing data in
the post-PC era. Data may be files or objects, tweets or 5TB videos, and you
can access it via a phone, browser or FUSE filesystem.

It's a way to store, sync, share, import, model, and back up content.
