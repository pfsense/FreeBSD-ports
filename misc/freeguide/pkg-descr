FreeGuide is a TV guide program. It uses parser programs to extract TV
information from web pages and stores them for viewing without the need to
connect to the Internet. The viewer allows the user to view television listings
and create customised TV guides by selecting programmes and by building up a
favourites list.

It works with listings for many countries.
