utouch - Kernel driver for absolute USB HID mouses emulated by some
virtualization systems like Virtual Box, BHyve, etc. It uses evdev
protocol to communicate with userland applications like libinput and
xf86-input-evdev.

The driver should be installed in to the guest FreeBSD system. Host system
should be configured to emulate mouse as a single-touch USB tablet.
