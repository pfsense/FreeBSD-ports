The inplace(1) command is a utility to edit files in-place through
given filter commands preserving the original file attributes.  Mode
and ownership (user and group) are preserved by default, and time
(access and modification) by choice.

Examples:
    # Sort files in-place using sort(1):
    inplace sort file1 file2 file3

    # Process image files preserving time and taking backup files:
    inplace -t -b.orig 'convert -rotate 270 -resize 50%% %1 %2' *.jpg
