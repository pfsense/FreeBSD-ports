This is libsolv, a free package dependency solver using a satisfiability
algorithm.

The code is based on two major, but independent, blocks:
1. Using a dictionary approach to store and retrieve package and dependency
   information in a fast and space efficient manner.
2. Using satisfiability, a well known and researched topic, for resolving
   package dependencies.

The sat-solver code has been written to aim for the newest packages, record the
decision tree to provide introspection, and also allows to provide the user with
suggestions on how to deal with unsolvable problems. It also takes advantage of
the repository storage to minimize memory usage.
