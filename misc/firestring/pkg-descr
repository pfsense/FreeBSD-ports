libfirestring is a string handling library that provides
maximum length aware string handling functions to programs.
Several functions provide saner interfaces than the standard
libc functions.  libfirestring also provides functions that
are in most libc's but not provided for by ANSI C, enabling
programmers to write ANSI C-compliant code while using such
safe functions (strcasecmp, strncasecmp, snprintf).

libfirestring also includes functions for dealing with
reading configuration files in an easy to program fashion.

This library uses long long, which is part of the C99 standard
(previously a GNU extension).	Your compiler needs to support
this in order for FireString to work.
