Dynomite, inspired by Dynamo whitepaper, is a thin, distributed dynamo layer
for different storage engines and protocols. Currently these include Redis and
Memcached. Dynomite supports multi-datacenter replication and is designed for
high availability.

The ultimate goal with Dynomite is to be able to implement high availability and
cross-datacenter replication on storage engines that do not inherently provide
that functionality. The implementation is efficient, not complex (few moving
parts), and highly performant.
