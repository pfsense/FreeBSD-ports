MMdnn is a set of tools to help users inter-operate among different deep
learning frameworks. E.g. model conversion and visualization. Convert models
between Caffe, Keras, MXNet, Tensorflow, CNTK, PyTorch Onnx and CoreML.

A comprehensive, cross-framework solution to convert, visualize and diagnose
deep neural network models. The "MM" in MMdnn stands for model management and
"dnn" is an acronym for the deep neural network.

Major features:
* Find model
  - We provide a model collection to help you find some popular models
  - We provide a model visualizer to display the network architecture more
    intuitively
* Conversion
  - We implement a universal converter to convert DNN models between
    frameworks, which means you can train on one framework and deploy on another
* Retrain
  - In the converter, we can generate some training/inference code snippet to
    simplify the retrain/evaluate work
* Deployment
