Aider is a command line tool that lets you pair program with LLMs, to edit
code stored in your local git repository. Aider will directly edit the
code in your local source files, and git commit the changes with sensible
commit messages. You can start a new project or work with an existing git
repo. Aider is unique in that it lets you ask for changes to pre-existing,
larger codebases. Aider works well with GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, GPT-3.5 and
supports connecting to almost any LLM.
