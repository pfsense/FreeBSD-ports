This is a utility into which you can pipe the output from various checksum
generators, to get coloured output.

It understands both the BSD "tag" form, as well as the GNU Coreutils/Perl
shasum(1) form of checksums, and has been tested with the output from
macOS' md5 and shasum, as well as GNU md5sum and sha256sum.
