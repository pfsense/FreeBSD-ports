ViSP standing for Visual Servoing Platform is a modular cross platform library
that allows prototyping and developing applications using visual tracking and
visual servoing technics at the heart of the researches done by Inria Lagadic
team. ViSP is able to compute control laws that can be applied to robotic
systems. It provides a set of visual features that can be tracked using real
time image processing or computer vision algorithms. ViSP provides also
simulation capabilities. ViSP can be useful in robotics, computer vision,
augmented reality and computer animation. Our YouTube channel gives an overview
of the applications that could be tackled.
