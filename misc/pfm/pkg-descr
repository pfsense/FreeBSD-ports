pfm is a terminal (curses)-based file manager written in Perl, based on the
PFM.COM for MS-DOS (originally by Paul Culley and Henk de Heer). Permission
to use the original name was kindly granted by the original authors.

Some of its features:

    * Commands are invoked with only one or two keypresses
    * Colored filenames according to extension or type
    * Support for executing user-defined commands (including wildcards)
      with only two keystrokes
    * A single-file and multiple-file mode
    * Multilevel sorting
    * Use of oldmarks and newmarks for executing multiple commands on
      the same group of files
    * Supports bookmarks for directories
    * Highly configurable through its config file
    * Supports commandline history and completion through use of the
      GNU readline library
    * Integration with versioning tools like Subversion, CVS, Bazaar,
      Mercurial, and Git
