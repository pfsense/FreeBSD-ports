tkRunIt is a run dialog box for X which allows you to execute
commandline without using an xterm.  tkRunIt was inspired by Xrun
but is designed to be completely navigable from the keyboard and
to allow extreme customizablility as I often find that personal
workspace tools/shortcuts are seldom workflow compatible across
users.
