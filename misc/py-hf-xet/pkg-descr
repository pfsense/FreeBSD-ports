Xet-core enables huggingface_hub to utilize xet storage for uploading
and downloading to HF Hub. Xet storage provides chunk-based
deduplication, efficient storage/retrieval with local disk caching,
and backwards compatibility with Git LFS. This library is not meant to
be used directly, and is instead intended to be used from
huggingface_hub.
