This is the distributed.net's distributed computing
client.  This client contains the modules for OGR
and RC5-72.  DES, CSC, and RC5-64 are no longer
included in this client.

As a "loosely knit" group of computer users from all
over the world, we take up challenges which require
a lot of computing power.  We solve these by distributing
the cpu power needed over the computers of our members.  That's
why we're called "distributed.net."  Read more about
it at www.distributed.net.
