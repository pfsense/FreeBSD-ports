Midnight Commander was built with subshell support, which works with most
popular shells, e.g. bash(1), dash(1), tcsh(1), zsh(1), but not sh(1) due
to its lack of "precmd" or equivalent hooks which mc(1) needs to read the
subshell's current directory.

  $ env SHELL=/bin/sh mc
  common.c: unimplemented subshell type 1
  read (subshell_pty...): No such file or directory (2)

Please either use more advanced interactive shell, or start mc(1) with -u
(--nosubshell) switch if you're confined to /bin/sh for some reason.
