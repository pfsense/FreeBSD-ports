lxi-tools is a collection of open source software tools that enables control
of LXI compatible instruments such as modern oscilloscopes, power supplies,
spectrum analyzers etc.

All features are consolidated in the 'lxi' application which provides a
simple commandline interface to discover LXI instruments, send SCPI
commands, and capture screenshots from supported LXI instruments.

lxi-tools rely on liblxi for all communication.
