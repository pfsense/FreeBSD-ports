npTDMS is a cross-platform Python package for reading and writing TDMS files
as produced by LabVIEW, and is built on top of the numpy package. Data is read
from TDMS files as numpy arrays, and npTDMS also allows writing numpy arrays
to TDMS files.

TDMS files are structured in a hierarchy of groups and channels. A TDMS file can
contain multiple groups, which may each contain multiple channels. A file, group
and channel may all have properties associated with them, but only channels have
array data.
