The Adaptable Input/Output (I/O) System, ADIOS 2 is developed as part of the
United States Department of Energy's Exascale Computing Program.

ADIOS 2 is a framework designed for scientific data I/O to publish and subscribe
(put/get) data when and where required.

ADIOS 2 transports data as groups of self-describing variables and attributes
across different media types (such as files, wide-area-networks, and remote
direct memory access) using a common application programming interface for all
transport modes. ADIOS 2 can be used on supercomputers, commercial clouds, and
personal computers.

ADIOS 2 focuses on:
* Performance I/O scalability in high performance computing (HPC) applications.
* Adaptability unified interfaces to allow for several modes of transport
  (files, memory-to-memory)
* Ease of Use two-level application programming interface (APIs)
* Full APIs for HPC applications: C++11, Fortran 90, C 99, Python 2 and 3
* Simplified High-Level APIs for data analysis: Python 2 and 3, C++11, Matlab
