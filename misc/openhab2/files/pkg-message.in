  message: <<EOM
The openHAB2 user interface "Paper UI" writes to /var/db/openhab2
(config) and to %%ETCDIR%% (when installing add-onds).
The config in %%ETCDIR%% is evaluated additionally to
/var/db/openhab2.

See %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/openhab2 for environment variables you need
to set by hand (all "export"-ones) if you want to execute some of
the openHAB2 commands from the shell directly.

When the openHAB2 docs talk about "userdata", look into /var/db/openhab2.

Serial ports do not work with FreeBSD, see:
	https://github.com/openhab/openhab1-addons/wiki/FreeBSD

By default openHAB2 tries to use IPv6. As FreeBSD does not support
mapping IPV4 multicast addresses inside IPv6 addresses you will get
the following error message:
	[ERROR] [org.jupnp.transport.Router] - Unable to initialize network router: org.jupnp.transport.spi.InitializationException: Could not initialize MulticastReceiverImpl: java.net.SocketException: Invalid argument

A workaround is to use the following rc.conf setting which will
prefer IPv4 over IPv6:
	openhab2_java_opts="-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"


If you upgrade from a pevious version, make a backup of
	/var/db/openhab2
read about the breaking changes in the release notes at
	https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/tag/2.5.0
and run
	%%PREFIX%%/libexec/openhab2/runtime/bin/update.freebsd
which takes care about changes for:
	- Textual Configuration
	- Next Generation Rule Engine
