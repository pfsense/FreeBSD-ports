This distribution contains a module I18N::Charset which maps Character
Set names to the names officially registered with IANA.  For example,
'Shift_JIS' is the official name of 'x-sjis'.

It also maps character set names to Unicode::Map8 conversion scheme
names (if Unicode::Map8 is installed).  For example, the Unicode::Map8
scheme name for 'windows-1251' is 'cp1251'.
