LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language
models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:
* Development: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source components
  and third-party integrations. Use LangGraph to build stateful agents with
  first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
* Productionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your
  applications, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with
  confidence.
* Deployment: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and
  Assistants with LangGraph Platform.
