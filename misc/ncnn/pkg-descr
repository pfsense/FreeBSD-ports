ncnn is a high-performance neural network inference computing framework
optimized for mobile platforms. ncnn is deeply concerned about its deployment
and use on mobile phones from the beginning of its design. ncnn does not have
third party dependencies. It is cross-platform, and runs faster than all known
open-source frameworks on mobile phone CPUs. Developers can easily deploy deep
learning algorithm models to mobile platforms by using the efficient ncnn
implementation. They can create intelligent apps, and bring the artificial
intelligence to your fingertips. ncnn is currently being used in many Tencent
applications, such as QQ, Qzone, WeChat, Pitu and so on.
