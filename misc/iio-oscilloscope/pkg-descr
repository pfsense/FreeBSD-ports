The ADI IIO Oscilloscope is a example application, which demonstrates how to
interface different evaluation boards from within a Linux system. The
application supports plotting of the captured data in four different modes
(time domain, frequency domain, constellation and cross-correlation). The
application also allows to view and modify several settings of the evaluation
board's devices.
