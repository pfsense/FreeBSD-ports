Unlike most of the terminal file managers, CliFM replaces the traditional
curses interface by a simple command-line interface.  It is a file manager,
but also a shell extension.

Search for files, copy, rename, and trash some of them, but, at the same
time, update/upgrade your system, add some cronjob, stop a service, and
run nano (or vi, or emacs, if you like).

Those familiar with the command line will find in a file manager based on
it a desirable addition to its functionality.  The command line is still
there, never hidden.
