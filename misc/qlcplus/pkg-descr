Q Light Controller Plus (QLC+) is a free and cross-platform software to control
DMX or analog lighting systems like moving heads, dimmers, scanners etc. This
project is a fork of the great QLC project written by Heikki Junnila that aims
to continue the QLC development and to introduce new features.
