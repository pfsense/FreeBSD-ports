Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models
for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules.

Diffusers offers three core components:
* State-of-the-art diffusion pipelines that can be run in inference with just a
  few lines of code.
* Interchangeable noise schedulers for different diffusion speeds and output
  quality.
* Pretrained models that can be used as building blocks, and combined with
  schedulers, for creating your own end-to-end diffusion systems.
