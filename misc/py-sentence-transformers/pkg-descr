This framework provides an easy method to compute embeddings for accessing,
using, and training state-of-the-art embedding and reranker models. It can be
used to compute embeddings using Sentence Transformer models (quickstart), to
calculate similarity scores using Cross-Encoder (a.k.a. reranker) models
(quickstart) or to generate sparse embeddings using Sparse Encoder models
(quickstart).
This unlocks a wide range of applications, including semantic search, semantic
textual similarity, and paraphrase mining.
