The UUID library is used to generate unique identifiers for objects
that may be accessible beyond the local system. This library
generates UUIDs compatible with those created by the Open Software
Foundation (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) utility
uuidgen.

The UUIDs generated by this library can be reasonably expected to be
unique within a system, and unique across all systems. They could
be used, for instance, to generate unique HTTP cookies across multiple
web servers without communication between the servers, and without fear
of a name clash.
