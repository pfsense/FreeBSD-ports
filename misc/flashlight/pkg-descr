Flashlight is a fast, flexible machine learning library written entirely in C++
from the Facebook AI Research and the creators of Torch, TensorFlow, Eigen and
Deep Speech.

Its core features include:
* Total internal modifiability including internal APIs for tensor computation.
* A small footprint, with the core clocking in at under 10 MB and 20k lines
  of C++.
* High-performance defaults featuring just-in-time kernel compilation with
  modern C++ via the ArrayFire tensor library.
* An emphasis on efficiency and scale.
