This little program enables iPod shuffle users to get rid of iTunes or other
complicated playlist management tools. Due to the simple structure of the
shuffle, it is possible to use the player almost like any other USB flash MP3
player: You simply copy MP3 files onto it. You only need to run the Datab ase
Builder program after you added or removed files from the iPod.
