The fast-histogram mini-package aims to provide simple and fast histogram
functions for regular bins that don't compromise on performance. It doesn't do
anything complicated - it just implements a simple histogram algorithm in C and
keeps it simple. The aim is to have functions that are fast but also robust and
reliable. The result is a 1D histogram function here that is 7-15x faster than
numpy.histogram, and a 2D histogram function that is 20-25x faster than
numpy.histogram2d.
