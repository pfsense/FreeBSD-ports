wireless protocols.

Features include:
* hardware interfaces for common Software Defined Radios
* easy demodulation of signals
* assigning participants to keep overview of your data
* customizable decodings to crack even sophisticated encodings like CC1101
  data whitening
* assign labels to reveal the logic of the protocol
* fuzzing component to find security leaks
* modulation support to inject the data back into the system
* simulation environment to perform stateful attacks

In order to use this software, you need SDR hardware, for example
* HackRF One (can send and receive on frequencies 1 MHz to 6 GHz)
* SDRplay RSP2pro (can receive on frequencies 1 kHz to 2 GHz)
