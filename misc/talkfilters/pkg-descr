The GNU Talk Filters are filter programs that convert ordinary English text into
text that mimics a stereotyped or otherwise humorous dialect. Each program reads
from standard input and writes to standard output.

The filters include:

	austro, b1ff, brooklyn, chef, cockney, drawl, dubya, fudd, funetak,
	jethro, jive, kraut, pansy, pirate, postmodern, redneck, valspeak, and
	warez.
