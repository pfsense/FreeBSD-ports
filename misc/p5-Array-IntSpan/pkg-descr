`Array::IntSpan' brings the speed advantages of `Set::IntSpan'
(written by Steven McDougall) to arrays. Uses include
manipulating grades, routing tables, or any other situation
where you have mutually exclusive ranges of integers that map to
given values.

`Array::IntSpan::IP' is also provided with the distribution. It
lets you use IP addresses in any of three forms (dotted decimal,
network string, and integer) for the indices into the array. See
the POD for that module for more information.
