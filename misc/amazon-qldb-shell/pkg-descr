amazon-qldb-shell provides an interface to send PartiQL statements to
Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB).

This tool is not intended to be incorporated into an application or adopted
for production purposes.

The objective of the tool is to give developers, devops, database
administrators, and anyone else interested the opportunity for rapid
experimentation with QLDB and PartiQL.
