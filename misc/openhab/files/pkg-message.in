  message: <<EOM
The openhab user interface writes to /var/db/openhab
(config) and to %%ETCDIR%% (when installing add-onds).
The config in %%ETCDIR%% is evaluated additionally to
/var/db/openhab.

See %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/openhab for environment variables you need
to set by hand (all "export"-ones) if you want to execute some of
the openhab commands from the shell directly.

When the openhab docs talk about "userdata", look into /var/db/openhab.

Serial ports do not work with FreeBSD, see:
	https://github.com/openhab/openhab1-addons/wiki/FreeBSD

By default openhab tries to use IPv6. As FreeBSD does not support
mapping IPV4 multicast addresses inside IPv6 addresses you will get
the following error message:
	[ERROR] [org.jupnp.transport.Router] - Unable to initialize network router: org.jupnp.transport.spi.InitializationException: Could not initialize MulticastReceiverImpl: java.net.SocketException: Invalid argument

A workaround is to use the following rc.conf setting which will
prefer IPv4 over IPv6:
	openhab_java_opts="-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"


If you upgrade from a pevious version, make a backup of
	/var/db/openhab
and read about the breaking changes in the release notes at
	https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/
