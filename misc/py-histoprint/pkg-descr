histoprint is a package for pretty print of NumPy (and other) histograms to the
console.

Histoprint uses a mix of terminal color codes and Unicode trickery (i.e.
combining characters) to plot overlaying histograms. Some terminals are not able
to display Unicode combining characters correctly. Histoprint can still be used
in those terminals, but the character set needs to be constrained to the
non-combining ones.
