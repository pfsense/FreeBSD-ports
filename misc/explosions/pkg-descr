This is a simplified 3D world with alpha-blended objects that look
kind of like fireworks or sparks. It also has a number of effects
built in, such as fading, blurring, fire ("heat"), and zooming.

It serves no purpose except to look pretty. The source-code is also
well-documented, so someone might find it useful in learning SDL
routines.
