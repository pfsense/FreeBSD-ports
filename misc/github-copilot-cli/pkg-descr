github-copilot-cli brings the power of GitHub Copilot coding agent directly to
your terminal. With GitHub Copilot CLI, you can work locally and synchronously
with an AI agent that understands your code and GitHub context.

Features:

* Terminal-native development: Work with Copilot coding agent directly in your
  command line - no context switching required.
* GitHub integration out of the box: Access your repositories, issues, and pull
  requests using natural language, all authenticated with your existing GitHub
  account.
* Agentic capabilities: Build, edit, debug, and refactor code with an AI
  collaborator that can plan and execute complex tasks.
* MCP-powered extensibility: Take advantage of the fact that the coding agent
  ships with GitHub's MCP server by default and supports custom MCP servers to
  extend capabilities.
* Full control: Preview every action before execution - nothing happens without
  your explicit approval.
