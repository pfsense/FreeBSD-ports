ColorBrewer is a set of color schemes for cartography and data
visualization, created by Cynthia Brewer. This Python package provides
these color schemes as a library for easy use in applications.

The color schemes are divided into three types:
* Sequential: for ordered data that progresses from low to high.
* Diverging: for data with a critical midpoint, like a zero value.
* Qualitative: for representing categorical data.

All color schemes are designed to be colorblind-safe and effective
for various display environments.
