Pubs brings your bibliography to the command line.

Pubs organizes your bibliographic documents together with the bibliographic
data associated to them and provides command line access to basic and advanced
manipulation of your library.

Pubs is built with the following principles in mind:
* all papers are referenced using unique citation keys,
* bibliographic data (i.e. pure bibtex information) is kept separated from
  metadata (including links to pdf or tags),
* everything is stored in plain text so it can be manually edited or version
  controlled.
