A simple, lightweight shell script to use OpenAI's chatGPT and DALL-E from the
terminal without installing python or node.js. The script uses the official
ChatGPT model gpt-3.5-turbo with the OpenAI API endpoint /chat/completions.
You can also use the new gpt-4 model, if you have access.

The script supports the use of all other OpenAI models with the completions
endpoint and the images/generations endpoint for generating images.
