MCP Probe is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client library and debugging toolkit
written in Rust. It provides both an SDK for building MCP integrations and an
interactive debugger for testing MCP servers.

Features:

- Terminal User Interface (TUI) for interactive debugging
- CLI mode for scripting and automation
- Support for multiple transport protocols (HTTP/SSE, WebSocket, stdio)
- Real-time monitoring of MCP server interactions
- Built-in testing capabilities for MCP servers

MCP Probe helps developers build, test, and debug MCP-compatible servers and
clients, making it easier to integrate with the Model Context Protocol
ecosystem.
