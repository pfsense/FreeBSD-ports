Cinder is a Block Storage service for OpenStack. It's designed to present
storage resources to end users that can be consumed by the OpenStack Compute
Project (Nova). This is done through the use of either a reference
implementation (LVM) or plugin drivers for other storage. The short
description of Cinder is that it virtualizes the management of block storage
devices and provides end users with a self service API to request and consume
those resources without requiring any knowledge of where their storage is
actually deployed or on what type of device.
