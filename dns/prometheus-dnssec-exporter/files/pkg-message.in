A default configuration file has been installed in
%%PREFIX%%/etc/prometheus-dnssec-checks.sample

You can use the included rc script to start the exporter
as a daemon:

# sysrc dnssec_exporter_enable=YES # or edit /etc/rc.conf manually
# service dnssec_exporter start

The default configuration will bind the exporter to localhost
on port 9204.
