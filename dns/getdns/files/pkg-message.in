  !!! IMPORTANT !!!!  libgetdns needs a DNSSEC trust anchor!

  For the library to be able to perform DNSSEC, the root
  trust anchor needs to be present in presentation format
  in the file:
     %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/unbound/root.key

  We recomend using unbound-anchor to retrieve and install
  the root trust anchor like this:
     su -m unbound -c /usr/local/sbin/unbound-anchor

EOM
