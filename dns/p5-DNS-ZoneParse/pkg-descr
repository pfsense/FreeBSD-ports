This module will parse a Zone File and put all the Resource Records (RRs) into
an anonymous hash structure. At the moment, the following types of RRs are
supported: SOA, NS, MX, A, CNAME, TXT, PTR. It could be useful for maintaining
DNS zones, or for transferring DNS zones to other servers. If you want to
generate an XML-friendly version of your zone files, it is easy to use
XML::Simple with this module once you have parsed the zonefile.

DNS::ZoneParse scans the DNS zonefile - removes comments and separates the file
into it's constituent records. It then parses each record and stores the
records internally. See below for information on the accessor methods.
