dnst :: Domain Name System Tools - a toolset to assist DNS operators
 with zone and nameserver maintenance.

dnst is intended to offer both:

- a supported drop-in replacement and upgrade path for a subset of the
  popular NLnet Labs LDNS example tools, re-implemented in the Rust
  programming language powered by the NLnet Labs domain Rust library
- an evolving toolbox of commands to aid DNS operators in the
  maintenance and operation of their zones and nameservers.
