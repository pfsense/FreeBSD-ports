Ruby Zonefile - Parse and manipulate DNS Zone Files

This class can read, manipulate and create DNS zone files. It supports A, AAAA,
MX, NS, SOA, TXT, CNAME, PTR and SRV records. The data can be accessed by the
instance method of the same name. All except SOA return an array of hashes
containing the named data. SOA directly returns the hash since there can only be
one SOA information.
