DRI stands for Domain Registration Interface and aims to be,
for domain name registries/registrars/resellers
what Perl DBI is for databases.

Net::DRI offers a uniform API to access services.
It can be used by registrars to access registries.
It can be used by clients to access registrars and/or resellers.
It can be used by anonyone to do whois, DAS or IRIS DCHK queries.
