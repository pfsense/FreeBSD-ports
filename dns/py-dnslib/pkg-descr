dnslib is a library to encode/decode DNS wire-format packets.

The library provides:
 - Support for encoding/decoding DNS packets between wire format, python
   objects, and Zone/DiG textual representation (dnslib.dns)
 - A server framework allowing the simple creation of custom DNS resolvers
   (dnslib.server) and a number of example servers created using this framework
 - A number of utilities for testing (dnslib.client, dnslib.proxy,
   dnslib.intercept)
