DSC (originally developed by The Measurement Factory and now developed
by DNS-OARC) is a system for collecting and exploring statistics from
busy DNS servers. It uses a distributed architecture with collectors
running on or near nameservers sending their data to one or more
central presenters for display and archiving. Collectors use pcap to
sniff network traffic. They transmit aggregated data to the presenter
as XML data. dsc is configurable to allow the administrator to capture
any kind of data that he or she chooses.
