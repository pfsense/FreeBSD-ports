To enable radns, edit /etc/rc.conf and add:

  radns_enable="YES"

radns won't touch your system's /etc/resolv.conf. It will write to its
own file %%PREFIX%%/etc/radns/radns-resolv.conf.

To make sure the system's /etc/resolv.conf file is created from all
sources, read %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/radns/README.FreeBSD.
