dnstable implements an encoding format for passive DNS data. It consists of a
C library, libdnstable, and several command line utilities for creating,
querying, and merging dnstable data files.

It stores key-value records in Sorted String Table (SSTable) files and provides
high-level interfaces for querying or iterating over the stored records.
dnstable encodes individual records using a format tailored for efficiently
storing passive DNS data and can quickly perform both "forward" and "inverse"
searches.
