  message: <<EOT
BIND requires configuration of rndc, including a "secret"
key.  The easiest, and most secure way to configure rndc is
to run 'rndc-confgen -a' to generate the proper conf file,
with a new random key, and appropriate file permissions.

The %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/named script will do that for you.

If using syslog to log the BIND9 activity, and using a
chroot'ed installation, you will need to tell syslog to install
a log socket in the BIND9 chroot by running:

  # sysrc altlog_proglist+=named

And then restarting syslogd with: service syslogd restart

  message: <<EOT
The BIND9 port was changed to respect upstream's change
concerning master and slave that were replaced by primary and
secondary, all the references in the sample files were updated
to reflect that.
