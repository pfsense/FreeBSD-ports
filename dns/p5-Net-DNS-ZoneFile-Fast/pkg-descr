The Net::DNS::ZoneFile::Fast module provides an ability to parse zone
files that BIND8 and BIND9 use, fast.  Currently it provides a single
function, parse(), which returns a reference to an array of traditional
Net::DNS::RR objects, so that no new API has to be learned in order to
manipulate zone records.
