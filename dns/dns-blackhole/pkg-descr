If you're running your own home network with a Unix-based server, you can
easily integrate a DNS blackhole into a local BIND DNS service -- and best
of all, it's completely free. If you're already using BIND and know your
way around it, you can use this script to manage BIND's Response Policy
Zone (RPZ) feature. RPZ is designed for DNS firewall/blocking purposes.
The script should run on *BSD and Linux distros with proper pathnames
configured. Out of the box, it has a FreeBSD default configuration.
