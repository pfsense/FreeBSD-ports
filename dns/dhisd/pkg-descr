DHIS is a client-server based system architecture primarily meant for
 updating DNS for hosts that have dynamic IP addresses. With DHIS you
 can have your computer always recognised and available on the Internet
 with the same unique name, even if its IP address changes frequently.

It supports both IPv4 and IPv6. For more information on the services,
 you should look at the official DHIS website.
