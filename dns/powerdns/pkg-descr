The PowerDNS Authoritative Server is the only solution that enables
authoritative DNS service from all major databases, including but not limited
to MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite3, LDAP and plain text files.

DNS answers can also be fully scripted using a variety of (scripting) languages
such as Lua, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, C and C++. Such scripting can be used
for dynamic redirection, (spam) filtering or real time intervention.

In addition, the PowerDNS Authoritative Server is the leading DNSSEC
implementation, hosting the majority of all DNSSEC domains worldwide. The
Authoritative Server hosts at least 30% of all domain names in Europe, and
around 90% of all DNSSEC domains in Europe.
