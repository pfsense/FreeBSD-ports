The PowerDNS Authoritative Server is a versatile nameserver which supports a
large number of backends. These backends can either be plain zone files or be
more dynamic in nature.

PowerDNS has the concepts of 'backends'. A backend is a datastore that the
server will consult that contains DNS records (and some metadata). The backends
range from database backends (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and BIND zone files to
co-processes and JSON API's.

Multiple backends can be enabled in the configuration by using the launch
option. Each backend can be configured separately.
