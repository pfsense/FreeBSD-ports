This is a port of No-IP.com's dynamic DNS update client.  When
configured correctly, the client will check the local IP address at a
given time interval for any changes.  If the local IP address has
changed it will notify the DNS servers at No-IP.com and update the IP
corresponding to your No-IP/No-IP+ hostname.
