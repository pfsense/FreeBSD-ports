Knot Resolver is a caching DNS resolver scalable from huge resolver
farms down to home network routers.
Knot Resolver is a modern resolver implementation designed for
scalability, resiliency, and flexibility. Its design is
different from other resolvers: The core architecture is tiny and
efficient, and most of the rich features are implemented as
optional modules, which limits attack surface and improves
performance.
