Library to generate static code representation of the Public suffix list.
The public suffix list is a database of top level domain names. The database
allows an application to determine if if a domain name requires an additional
label to be valid.

The principle use in a web browser is to restrict supercookies being set
although it can also serve secondary purposes in the UI such as domain
highlighting.
