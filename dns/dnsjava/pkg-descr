dnsjava is an implementation of DNS in Java. It supports all defined record
types (including the DNSSEC types), and unknown types. It can be used for
queries, zone transfers, and dynamic updates. It includes a cache which can be
used by clients, and a minimal implementation of a server. It supports TSIG
authenticated messages, partial DNSSEC verification, and EDNS0.

dnsjava provides functionality above and beyond that of the InetAddress class.
Since it is written in pure Java, dnsjava is fully threadable, and in many
cases is faster than using InetAddress.

dnsjava provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high level
functions perform queries for records of a given name, type, and class, and
return an array of records. There is also a clone of InetAddress, which is even
simpler. A cache is used to reduce the number of DNS queries sent. The low
level functions allow direct manipulation of DNS messages and records, as well
as allowing additional resolver properties to be set.
