Spatial Optimization

Spopt is an open-source Python library for solving optimization problems with
spatial data. Originating from the region module in PySAL (Python Spatial
Analysis Library), it is under active development for the inclusion of newly
proposed models and methods for regionalization, facility location, and
transportation-oriented solutions.
