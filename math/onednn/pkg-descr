Intel(R) Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel(R) MKL-DNN) is an
open source performance library for deep learning applications. The library
accelerates deep learning applications and framework on Intel(R) architecture.
Intel(R) MKL-DNN contains vectorized and threaded building blocks which you can
use to implement deep neural networks (DNN) with C and C++ interfaces.

DNN functionality optimized for Intel architecture is also included in Intel(R)
Math Kernel Library (Intel(R) MKL). API in this implementation is not compatible
with Intel MKL-DNN and does not include certain new and experimental features.
