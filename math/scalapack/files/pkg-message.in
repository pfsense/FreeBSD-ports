 Please test your scalapack installation
 Example programs are located at %%EXAMPLESDIR%%

 Test programs are located at %%DATADIR%%/TESTING

 Example:
  % cd %%DATADIR%%/TESTING
  % %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/mpirun -np 4 ./xcbrd
  % %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/mpirun -np 4 ./xcdblu
   etc., etc. ...

  to perform all the tests,
  % cd %%DATADIR%%/TESTING
  % csh
  % foreach i (x*)
  ? %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/mpirun -np 4 ./$i >& ~/$i.log
  ? end
  % %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/mpdallexit

 If you're using OpenMPI, use this instead:
  % cd %%DATADIR%%/TESTING
  % LD_LIBRARY_PATH=%%LOCALBASE%%/mpi/openmpi/lib/ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  % PATH=$PATH:%%LOCALBASE%%/mpi/openmpi/bin/ export PATH
  % mpirun -np 4 ./xcbrd
  % mpirun -np 4 ./xcdblu
   etc., etc. ...

You can change -np 4 to any number to meet your environment.
See files at %%DOCSDIR%% for detail.
