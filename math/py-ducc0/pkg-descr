ducc0 is a collection of basic programming tools for numerical computation,
including Fast Fourier Transforms, Spherical Harmonic Transforms, non-equispaced
Fourier transforms, as well as some concrete applications like 4pi convolution
on the sphere and gridding/degridding of radio interferometry data.
