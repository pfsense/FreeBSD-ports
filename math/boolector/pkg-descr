Boolector is a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver for the theories of
fixed-size bit-vectors, arrays and uninterpreted functions. It supports the
SMT-LIB logics BV, QF_ABV, QF_AUFBV, QF_BV and QF_UFBV. Boolector provides a
rich C and Python API and supports incremental solving, both with the SMT-LIB
commands push and pop, and solving under assumptions.
