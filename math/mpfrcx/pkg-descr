MPFRCX is a library for the arithmetic of univariate polynomials over arbitrary
precision real (GNU MPFR) or complex (GNU MPC) numbers, without control on the
rounding. The functions implemented are not very numerous and somewhat
idiosyncratic: the main motivation behind the library is to have functionality
available for the floating-point approach to complex multiplication. However,
asymptotically fast routines such as Toom-Cook and the FFT for multiplication of
polynomials are available, as well as fast routines for interpolation and
evaluation based on trees of polynomials.
