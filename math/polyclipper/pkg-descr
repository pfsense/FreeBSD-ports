Polytope is a C++ library for generating polygonal and polyhedral meshes.
It makes use of various 2D and 3D tessellation techniques, but provides
a single representation for these tessellations, and a simple interface
for generating them.

Polytope has a simple C interface for use with other languages. It also
includes bindings for Python. These bindings allow you to easily incorporate
Polytope into your own mesh generation tools.
