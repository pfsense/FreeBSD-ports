Spectral Python (SPy) is a pure Python module for processing hyperspectral
image data. It has functions for reading, displaying, manipulating, and
classifying hyperspectral imagery. It can be used interactively from the Python
command prompt or via Python scripts. SPy is free, open source software
distributed under the GNU General Public License. To see some examples of how
SPy can be used, you may want to jump straight to the documentation sections
on Displaying Data or Spectral Algorithms. A categorized listing of the main
classes and functions are in the Class/Function Glossary. You can download SPy
from GitHub or the Python Package Index (PyPI). See the Installing SPy section
section of the documentation for details.
