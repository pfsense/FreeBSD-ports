Nevergrad is a gradient-free optimization platform.

The goals of this package are to provide:
- gradient/derivative-free optimization algorithms, including algorithms able to
  handle noise.
- tools to instrument any code, making it painless to optimize your
  parameters/hyperparameters, whether they are continuous, discrete or a mixture
  of continuous and discrete variables.
- functions on which to test the optimization algorithms.
- benchmark routines in order to compare algorithms easily.
