The Littlewood-Richardson Calculator is a program designed to compute
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. This program is written in the C language to
make the computation as efficient as possible. The program can compute single
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, products of Schur functions, or skew Schur
functions. In addition it can compute products in the small quantum cohomology
ring of a Grassmann variety. The software package also includes a program that
performs fast computation of the more general multiplicative structure constants
of Schubert polynomials.
