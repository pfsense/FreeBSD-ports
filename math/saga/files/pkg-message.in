Your SAGA GIS installation now resides under
  %%PREFIX%%/lib/saga

Besides the graphical user interface saga_gui, saga_cmd is of
particular importance for processing geodata. The latter can
be used in scripts or directly in the shell.

All extra material like helpers and templates are at
  %%DATADIR%%/

Predefined ToolChains in xml format are located under
  %%DATADIR%%/toolchains/
  
A ToolChains manual and cheatsheet can be found at
  %%DATADIR%%/docs

Using the SAGA Python package PySAGA, the majority of all
SAGA tools and functions, including the Grid Calculator,
can be used directly in Python. The PySAGA package is
located in the following directory
  %%PREFIX%%/lib/python%%PYTHON_VER%%/site-packages/PySAGA

Python scripts with examples, utilities, and test data
are located at:
  %%DATADIR%%/python/

A good starting point is the script saga_python_example.py.
Another good example can be found at
  https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/news/2023/10/saga-920-released/
