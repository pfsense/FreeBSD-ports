This library implements C++ classes with which half, single, double, quadruple
and octuple precision IEEE 754 floating point numbers can be operated.

Internally, these classes are implemented as class templates on top of
arbitrary-precision integer class templates so that the templates are expanded
as arbitrary precision floating-point operations by just changing the template
parameters, rather than implementing each floating-point operation for each
precision. The arbitrary-precision integer class templates are also included in
this library.
