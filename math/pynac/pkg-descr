Pynac -- "Python is Not a CAS" is a modified version of Ginac that
replaces the depency of GiNaC on CLN by a dependency instead of Python.
It is a lite version of GiNaC as well, not implementing all the features
of the full GiNaC, and it is *only* meant to be used as a Python library.

Note: since Sage-9.5, Pynac has been merged into the Sage library source code.
