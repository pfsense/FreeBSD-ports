Google Optimization Tools (a.k.a., OR-Tools) is an open-source, fast and
portable software suite for solving combinatorial optimization problems.

The suite contains:
* A constraint programming solver
* A linear programming solver
* Wrappers around commercial and other open source solvers, including mixed
  integer solvers
* Bin packing and knapsack algorithms
* Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem and Vehicle Routing Problem
* Graph algorithms (shortest paths, min cost flow, max flow, linear sum
  assignment)
