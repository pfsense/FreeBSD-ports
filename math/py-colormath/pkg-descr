colormath is a simple Python module that spares the user from directly dealing
with color math.

Some features include:

 * Support for a wide range of color spaces. A good chunk of the CIE spaces,
   RGB, HSL/HSV, CMY/CMYK, and many more.
 * Conversions between the various color spaces. For example, XYZ to sRGB,
   Spectral to XYZ, CIE Lab to Adobe RGB.
 * Calculation of color difference. All CIE Delta E functions, plus CMC.
 * Chromatic adaptations (changing illuminants).
 * RGB to hex and vice-versa.
 * 16-bit RGB support.
