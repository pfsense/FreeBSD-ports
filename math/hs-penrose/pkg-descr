Penrose is a platform that enables people to create beautiful diagrams just by
typing mathematical notation in plain text. The goal is to make it easy for
non-experts to create and explore high-quality diagrams, providing deeper
insight into challenging technical concepts. We aim to democratize the process
of creating visual intuition.
