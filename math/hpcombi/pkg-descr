High Performance Combinatorics in C++ using vector instructions.

SSE and AVX instruction sets allows for very fast manipulation of combinatorial
objects such as transformations, permutations, boolean matrices of small size.
The goal of this project is to implement various new algorithms and benchmark
them on various compiler and architecture.
