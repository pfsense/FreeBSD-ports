dune-curvedgeometry is a module of the DUNE Numerics framework for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods.

The CurvedGeometry is a Geometry parametrized by a local-to-global mapping that
is interpolated into a local basis. In the Traits type the local basis in
encoded by a LocalFiniteElement Cache type, that allows to construct a local
FiniteElement and with this also the local basis.
