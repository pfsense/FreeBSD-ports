CSDP is a library of routines that implements a predictor corrector variant of
the semidefinite programming algorithm of Helmberg, Rendl, Vanderbei, and
Wolkowicz. The main advantages of this code are that it is written to be used as
a callable subroutine, it is written in C for efficiency, the code runs in
parallel on shared memory multi-processor systems, and it makes effective use of
sparsity in the constraint matrices. CSDP has been compiled on many different
systems. The code should work on any system with an ANSI C Compiler and
BLAS/LAPACK libraries.
