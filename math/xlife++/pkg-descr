XLiFE++ is an FEM-BEM C++ code developed by P.O.e.m.s. laboratory and I.R.M.A.R.
laboratory, that can solve 1D/2D/3D, scalar/vector,
transient/stationary/harmonic problems.

It provides:
* Advanced mesh tools, with refinement methods, including an advanced interface
  to the mesh generator Gmsh
* High order Lagrange Finite Elements (every order)
* High order edge Finite Elements (every order)
* Boundary Elements methods: Laplace, Helmholtz, Maxwell, Stokes (in progress)
* Essential conditions (periodic, quasi-periodic)
* Absorbing conditions: DtN, PML, ...
* Export to visualization tools such as Gmsh, Paraview, Matlab
* Many solvers (direct solvers, iterative solvers, eigenvalue solvers, wrappers
  to Arpack, UmfPack and Eigen libraries)
