dune-geometry is a module of the DUNE Numerics framework for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods.

dune-geometry includes everything related to the DUNE reference elements. This
includes the reference elements themselves, mappings on the reference elements
(geometries), and quadratures.
