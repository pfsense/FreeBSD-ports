Blaze is an open-source, high-performance C++ math library for dense and sparse
arithmetic. With its state-of-the-art Smart Expression Template implementation
Blaze combines the elegance and ease of use of a domain-specific language with
HPC-grade performance, making it one of the most intuitive and fastest C++ math
libraries available.

The Blaze library offers:
* high performance through the integration of BLAS libraries and manually tuned
  HPC math kernels
* vectorization by SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4, AVX, AVX2, AVX-512, FMA,
  and SVML
* parallel execution by OpenMP, HPX, C++11 threads and Boost threads
* the intuitive and easy to use API of a domain specific language
* unified arithmetic with dense and sparse vectors and matrices
* thoroughly tested matrix and vector arithmetic
* completely portable, high quality C++ source code
