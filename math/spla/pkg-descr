SPLA provides specialized functions for linear algebra computations with a C++
and C interface, which are inspired by requirements in computational material
science codes.

Currently, SPLA provides functions for distributed matrix multiplications with
specific matrix distributions, which cannot be used directly with a ScaLAPACK
interface. All computations can optionally utilize GPUs through CUDA or ROCm,
where matrices can be located either in host or device memory.
