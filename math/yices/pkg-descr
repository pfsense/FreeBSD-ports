Yices 2 is an SMT solver that decides the satisfiability of formulas containing
uninterpreted function symbols with equality, real and integer arithmetic,
bitvectors, scalar types, and tuples. Yices 2 supports both linear and nonlinear
arithmetic.

Yices 2 can process input written in the SMT-LIB notation (both versions 2.0 and
1.2 are supported). Alternatively, you can write specifications using Yices 2's
own specification language, which includes tuples and scalar types. You can also
use Yices 2 as a library in your software.
