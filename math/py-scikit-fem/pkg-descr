scikit-fem is a pure Python library for performing finite element assembly. Its
main purpose is the transformation of bilinear forms into sparse matrices and
linear forms into vectors.

The library
- has minimal dependencies
- contains no compiled code
- supports one-dimensional, triangular, quadrilateral, tetrahedral and
  hexahedral finite elements
- includes special elements such as Raviart-Thomas, Nedelec, MINI,
  Crouzeix-Raviart, Argyris, ...
