dune-functions is a module of the DUNE Numerics framework for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods.

dune-functions provides an abstraction layer for global finite element
functions. Its two main concepts are functions implemented as callable
objects, and bases of finite element spaces.
