This perl library aims to provide as many tools to make it as simple as possible
to calculate distances between geographic points, and anything that can be
derived from that. Currently there is support for finding the closest locations
within a specified distance, to find the closest number of points to a specified
point, and to do basic point-to-point distance calculations.
