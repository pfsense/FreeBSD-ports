iminuit is a Jupyter-friendly Python interface for the Minuit2 C++ library
maintained by CERN's ROOT team.

It can be used as a general robust function minimisation method, but is most
commonly used for likelihood fits of models to data, and to get model parameter
error estimates from likelihood profile analysis.
