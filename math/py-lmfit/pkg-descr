Lmfit provides a high-level interface to non-linear optimization and curve
fitting problems for Python. It builds on and extends many of the optimization
methods of scipy.optimize. Initially inspired by (and named for) extending the
Levenberg-Marquardt method from scipy.optimize.leastsq, lmfit now provides a
number of useful enhancements to optimization and data fitting problems.
