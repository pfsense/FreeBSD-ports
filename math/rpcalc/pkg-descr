rpCalc started out as a little program written to try out various
Python GUI toolkits. But I ended up using it all the time (it's
much quicker to pull it up than to pull an actual HP calculator out
of the desk), and I made several improvements. So I decided to make
it available to others who also like RPN calculators.
