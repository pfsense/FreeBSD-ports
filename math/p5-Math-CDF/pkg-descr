This module provides a perl interface to the DCDFLIB. See the section on DCDFLIB
for more information.

Functions are available for 7 continuous distributions (Beta, Chi-square, F,
Gamma, Normal, Poisson and T-distribution) and for two discrete distributions
(Binomial and Negative Binomial). Optional non-centrality parameters are
available for the Chi-square, F and T-distributions. Cumulative probabilities
are available for all 9 distributions and quantile functions are available for
the 7 continuous distributions.
