The OSQP (Operator Splitting Quadratic Program) solver is a numerical
optimization package for solving convex quadratic programs.

OSQP uses a specialized ADMM-based first-order method with custom sparse linear
algebra routines that exploit structure in problem data.

The algorithm is absolutely division free after the setup and it requires no
assumptions on problem data (the problem only needs to be convex).

OSQP is self-contained and requires no external library to run.
