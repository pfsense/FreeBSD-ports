Verdict is a collection of subroutines for evaluating the geometric qualities
of triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, and hexahedra using a variety of
metrics. A metric is a real number assigned to one of these shapes depending
on its particular vertex coordinates. These metrics are used to evaluate the
input to finite element, finite volume, boundary element, and other types
of solvers that approximate the solution to partial differential equations
defined over regions of space. The geometric qualities of these regions is
usually strongly tied to the accuracy these solvers are able to obtain in their
approximations.
