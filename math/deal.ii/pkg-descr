deal.II - a name that originally meant to indicate that it is the successor to
the Differential Equations Analysis Library - is a C++ program library targeted
at the computational solution of partial differential equations using adaptive
finite elements. It uses state-of-the-art programming techniques to offer you a
modern interface to the complex data structures and algorithms required.

The main aim of deal.II is to enable rapid development of modern finite element
codes, using among other aspects adaptive meshes and a wide array of tools
classes often used in finite element program. Writing such programs is a
non-trivial task, and successful programs tend to become very large and complex.
We believe that this is best done using a program library that takes care of the
details of grid handling and refinement, handling of degrees of freedom, input
of meshes and output of results in graphics formats, and the like. Likewise,
support for several space dimensions at once is included in a way such that
programs can be written independent of the space dimension without unreasonable
penalties on run-time and memory consumption.

deal.II is widely used in many academic and commercial projects. For its
creation, its principal authors have received the 2007 J. H. Wilkinson Prize for
Numerical Software. It is also part of the industry standard SPEC CPU 2006 and
SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark suites used to determine the speed of computers and
compilers.
