This is an ANSI C++ implementation of the complete ANSI C specification of
Chapter 3 of the BLAS Technical Forum Standard. The distribution is quite
small and it is meant as a starting point for developing an optimized and
architecture-dependent version. (C++ was used, rather than C, as it has support
for complex arithmetic and templates to facilitate to creation of various
precision codes.) The library includes support for all four precision types
(single, double precision, real, and complex) and Level 1, 2, and 3 operations.
