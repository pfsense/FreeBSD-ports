resample is a resampling-based inference in Python based on data resampling and
permutation.

Features:
* Bootstrap resampling: ordinary or balanced with optional stratification
* Extended bootstrap resampling: also varies sample size
* Parametric resampling: Gaussian, Poisson, gamma, etc.)
* Jackknife estimates of bias and variance of any estimator
* Compute bootstrap confidence intervals (percentile or BCa) for any estimator
* Permutation-based variants of traditional statistical tests (USP test of
  independence and others)
* Tools for working with empirical distributions (CDF, quantile, etc.)
* Depends only on numpy and scipy
