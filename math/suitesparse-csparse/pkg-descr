This port builds the module CSparse of SuiteSparse.

CSparse is a Concise Sparse Matrix package. This code goes with the book "Direct
Methods for Sparse Linear Systems," Timothy A. Davis, SIAM, Philadelphia, 2006.

Note: the CSparse library is meant for personal experimentation. For system-wide
installation, please install math/suitesparse-cxsparse instead.
