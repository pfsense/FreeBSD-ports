libsemigroups is a C++11 library containing implementations of several
algorithms for computing finite and finitely presented semigroups.
Namely:

 - the Froidure-Pin algorithm for computing finite semigroups;
 - the Todd-Coxeter algorithm for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
 - the Knuth-Bendix algorithm for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
 - the Schreier-Sims algorithm for permutation groups.
