     data page.
   - Output models as LaTeX files, in tabular or equation format (not very
     flexible yet).
   - Integrated scripting language: enter commands either via the gui or via
     scripts.
   - Command loop structure for Monte Carlo simulations.
   - GUI controller for fine-tuning Gnuplot graphs.
