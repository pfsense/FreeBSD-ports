OpenScop is an open specification that defines a file format and a set of
data structures to represent a static control part (SCoP for short),
i.e., a program part that can be represented in the polyhedral model.
The goal of OpenScop is to provide a common interface to various
polyhedral compilation tools in order to simplify their interaction.
