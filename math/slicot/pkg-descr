SLICOT - Subroutine Library In COntrol Theory - is a general purpose basic
mathematical library for control theoretical computations. The library provides
tools to perform essential system analysis and synthesis tasks. The main
emphasis in SLICOT is on numerical reliability of implemented algorithms and the
numerical robustness and efficiency of routines. Providing algorithmic
flexibility and the use of rigorous implementation and documentation standards
are other SLICOT features.

The SLICOT Library is available as standard Fortran 77 code in double precision.
Each user-callable subroutine for control computations is accompanied by an
example program which illustrates the use of the subroutine and can act as a
template for the user's own routines.
