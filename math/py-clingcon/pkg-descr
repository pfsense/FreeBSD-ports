Clingcon is an answer set solver for constraint logic programs, building upon
the answer set solver clingo. It extends the high-level modeling language of ASP
with constraint solving capacities. Constraints over finite domain integer
variables can be used in logic programs. Clingcon adopts state-of-the-art
techniques from the area of SMT, like conflict-driven learning and theory
propagation. It uses lazy nogood and variable generation on the order encoding
and features several preprocessing techniques.
