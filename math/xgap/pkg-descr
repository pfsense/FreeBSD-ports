XGAP is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the GAP system for
computational discrete algebra. It allows for the visualization
of mathematical objects and is particularly useful for investigating
subgroup lattices of groups.

XGAP provides interactive displays and gives access to various
GAP functions for group theory. It runs as a separate C program
alongside the main GAP session to handle graphics and user interactions.
