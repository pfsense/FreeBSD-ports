MPSolve stands for Multiprecision Polynomial SOLVEr.
It is a software that aims to provide an easy to use (hopefully) universal
blackbox for solving polynomials and secular equations.

Among its features you can find:
* Arbitrary precision approximation.
* Guaranteed inclusion radii for the results.
* Exploiting of polynomial structures: it can take advantage of sparsity as
  well as coefficients in a particular domain (i.e. integers or rationals).
* It can be specialized for specific classes of polynomials. As an example,
  see the roots of the Mandelbrot polynomial of degree 2.097.151 computed in
  about 10 days on a dual Xeon server.
