pyodeint provides a Python binding to odeint. Currently, the following steppers
are exposed:
* rosenbrock4: 4th order Rosenbrock (implicit multistep) stepper
* dopri5: 5th order DOPRI5 (explicit runge-kutta)
* bs: Bulirsch-Stoer stepper (modified midpoint rule).

The Rosenbrock4 stepper requires that the user provides a routine for
calculating the Jacobian.

You may also want to know that you can use pyodeint from pyodesys which can e.g.
derive the Jacobian analytically for you (pyodesys also provides plotting
functions, C++ code-generation and more).
