ARIBAS is an interactive interpreter for big integer arithmetic and
multi-precision floating point arithmetic with a Pascal/Modula like
syntax. It has several builtin functions for algorithmic number
theory like gcd, Jacobi symbol, Rabin probabilistic prime test,
continued fraction and quadratic sieve factorization, Pollard rho
factorization, etc.
