dune-pdelab is a module of the DUNE Numerics framework for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods.

PDELab is a PDE solver toolbox. The main intention is to provide a good set of
high-level abstractions to allow for a reasonably quick development of
simulation codes, while at the same time offering the flexibility to implement
new numerical methods and optimize for specific simulation scenarios.
