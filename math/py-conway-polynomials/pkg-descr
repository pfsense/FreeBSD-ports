Python interface to Frank Luebeck's Conway polynomial database.

Frank Luebeck maintains a list of pre-computed Conway polynomial coefficients.
These are used in several computer algebra systems such as GAP and SageMath
to provide quick access to those Conway polynomials.

The package consists of a single module containing a single function that
returns a dict of dicts, conway_polynomials.database(). The dictionary's
format is {p: {n: coefficients}}, where p represents your prime and n your
degree. The tuple of coefficients is returned in ascending order; that is,
the first coefficient (at index zero) is for the constant (degree zero) term.

This package is an evolution of the SageMath conway_polynomials package
and is maintained by the same team of developers.
