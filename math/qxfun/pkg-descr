QXFUN: A quad precision package with special functions (approximately 33 digit
precision).

This package enhances an IEEE quad precision floating-point facility (approx. 33
digit accuracy) to include a library of numerous special functions, all by
making only very minor changes to existing Fortran programs. The package should
run correctly on any Unix-based system supporting a Fortran-2008 compiler and
IEEE 128-bit floating-point arithmetic, in hardware or software.
