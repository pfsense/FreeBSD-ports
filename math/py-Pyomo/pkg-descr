Pyomo is a Python-based open-source software package that supports a diverse
set of optimization capabilities for formulating and analyzing optimization
models.

Modeling optimization applications is a core capability of Pyomo. Pyomo can be
used to define symbolic problems, create concrete problem instances, and solve
these instances with standard solvers. Thus, Pyomo provides a capability that is
commonly associated with algebraic modeling languages such as AMPL, AIMMS, and
GAMS, but Pyomo's modeling objects are embedded within a full-featured
high-level programming language with a rich set of supporting libraries. Pyomo
supports a wide range of problem types, including:
* Linear programming
* Quadratic programming
* Nonlinear programming
* Mixed-integer linear programming
* Mixed-integer quadratic programming
* Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
* Mixed-integer stochastic programming
* Generalized disjunctive programming
* Differential algebraic equations
* Bilevel programming
* Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints
