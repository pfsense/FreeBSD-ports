Before a calculation can be performed on a parallel computer, it must
first be decomposed into tasks which are assigned to different processors.

Efficient use of the machine requires that each processor have about the
same amount of work to do and that the quantity of interprocessor
communication is kept small.  Finding an optimal decomposition is provably
hard, but due to its practical importance, a great deal of effort has been
devoted to developing heuristics for this problem.  The decomposition
problem can be addressed in terms of graph partitioning.

Chaco implements a variety of algorithms for graph partitioning and is
used at most of the major parallel computing centers around the world to
simplify the development of parallel applications, and to ensure that high
performance is obtained.  Chaco has contributed to a wide variety of
computational studies including investigation of the molecular structure
of liquid crystals, evaluating the design of a chemical vapor deposition
reactor and modeling automobile collisions.

MBDyn.
