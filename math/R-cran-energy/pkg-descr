E-statistics (energy) tests and statistics for multivariate and univariate
inference, including distance correlation, one-sample, two-sample, and
multi-sample tests for comparing multivariate distributions, are implemented.
Measuring and testing multivariate independence based on distance correlation,
partial distance correlation, multivariate goodness-of-fit tests, k-groups and
hierarchical clustering based on energy distance, testing for multivariate
normality, distance components (disco) for non-parametric analysis of
structured data, and other energy statistics/methods are implemented.
