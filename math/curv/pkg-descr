Curv is a programming language for creating art using mathematics. It's a 2D and
3D geometric modelling tool that supports full colour, animation and 3D
printing.

Features:
* Curv is a simple, powerful, dynamically typed, pure functional programming
  language.
* Curv is easy to use for beginners. It has a standard library of predefined
  geometric shapes, plus operators for transforming and combining shapes. These
  can be plugged together like Lego to make 2D and 3D models.
* Coloured shapes are represented using Function Representation (F-Rep). They
  can be infinitely detailed, infinitely large, and any shape or colour pattern
  that can be described using mathematics can be represented exactly.
* Curv exposes the full power of F-Rep programming to experts. The standard
  geometry library is written entirely in Curv. Many of the demos seen on
  shadertoy.com can be reproduced in Curv, using shorter, simpler programs.
  Experts can package techniques used on shadertoy as high level operations for
  use by beginners.
* Curv can export meshes to STL, OBJ and X3D files for 3D printing. The X3D
  format supports full colour 3D printing (on Shapeways.com, at least). These
  meshes are defect free: watertight, manifold, with no self intersections,
  degenerate triangles, or flipped triangles.
