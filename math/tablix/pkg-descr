Tablix is a powerful free software kernel for solving general timetabling
problems. It uses a coarse-grained parallel genetic algorithm in
combination with other techniques to construct sensible timetables from XML
formatted problem descriptions. Tablix can run on a single host as well as
on a heterogeneous parallel virtual machine using PVM3.

Tablix kernel supports a very wide range of timetabling problems,
from high school timetabling to barge scheduling. A number of timetable
constraints are already implemented in the default installation.
Because of kernel's modular design it is easy to add custom timetable
constraints and/or modify existing ones. Kernel modules are written in C.
Extensive API documentation is available on the internet
and in the source distribution.
