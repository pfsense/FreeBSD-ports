The tool interprets the high level constructs of TLSF 1.1 (functions, sets, ...)
and supports the transformation of the specification to Linear Temporal Logic
(LTL) in different output formats. The tool has been designed to be modular with
respect to the supported output formats and semantics. Furthermore, the tool
allows to identify and manipulate parameters, targets and semantics of a
specification on the fly. This is especially thought to be useful for
comparative studies, as they are for example needed in the Synthesis
Competition.
