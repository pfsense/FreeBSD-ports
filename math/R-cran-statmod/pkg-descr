A collection of algorithms and functions to aid statistical modeling.
Includes limiting dilution analysis (aka ELDA), growth curve comparisons,
mixed linear models, heteroscedastic regression, inverse-Gaussian
probability calculations, Gauss quadrature and a secure convergence
algorithm for nonlinear models. Also includes advanced generalized linear
model functions including Tweedie and Digamma distributional families
and a secure convergence algorithm.
