dune-alugrid is a module of the DUNE Numerics framework for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods.

dune-alugrid provides an adaptive, load-balancing, and unstructured
implementation of the DUNE grid interface in two or three space dimensions
supporting either simiex or cube elements.
