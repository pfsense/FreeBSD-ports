Rumur is a model checker, a formal verification tool for proving safety and
security properties of systems represented as state machines. It is based on a
previous tool, CMurphi, and intended to be close to a drop-in replacement. Rumur
takes the same input format as CMurphi, the Murphi modelling language, with some
extensions and generates a C program that implements a verifier.
