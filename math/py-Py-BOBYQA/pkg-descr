Py-BOBYQA is a flexible package for finding local solutions to nonlinear,
nonconvex minimization problems (with optional bound constraints), without
requiring any derivatives of the objective. Py-BOBYQA is a Python implementation
of the BOBYQA solver by Powell (documentation here). It is particularly useful
when evaluations of the objective function are expensive and/or noisy.
