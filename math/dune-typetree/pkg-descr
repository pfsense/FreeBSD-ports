dune-typetree is a module of the DUNE Numerics framework for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods.

dune-typetree is a template library for constructing and operating on statically
typed trees of objects. It is based around the idea of defining loosely coupled,
componentized algorithms. Component lookup happens through tag dispatch, making
it very easy to extend and / or modify existing algorithms as well as
constructing new algorithms for existing types of tree nodes.
