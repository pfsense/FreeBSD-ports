This port installs the module LDL of SuiteSparse.

LDL is a sparse LDL' factorization and solve package.

These routines are not terrifically fast (they do not use dense matrix kernels),
but the code is very short and concise. The purpose is to illustrate the
algorithms in a very concise and readable manner, primarily for educational
purposes. Although the code is very concise, this package is slightly faster
than the built-in sparse Cholesky factorization in MATLAB 6.5 (chol), when
using the same input permutation.
