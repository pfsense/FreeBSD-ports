Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations, constrained Delaunay
triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and quality conforming Delaunay
triangulations. The latter can be generated with no small angles, and
are thus suitable for finite element analysis.

Show Me graphically displays (using X) the contents of geometric files,
especially those generated by Triangle, my two-dimensional quality mesh
generator and Delaunay triangulator.
Show Me can also write PostScript images to files.
