Contains functions used across packages 'DDIwR', 'QCA' and 'venn'. Interprets
and translates, factorizes and negates SOP - Sum of Products expressions, for
both binary and multi-value crisp sets, and extracts information (set names, set
values) from those expressions. Other functions perform various other checks if
possibly numeric (even if all numbers reside in a character vector) and coerce
to numeric, or check if the numbers are whole. It also offers, among many
others, a highly versatile recoding routine and a more flexible alternative to
the base function 'with()'. Some of the functions in this package use related
functions from package 'QCA'. Users are encouraged to install that package
despite not being listed in the Imports field, due to circular dependency
issues.
