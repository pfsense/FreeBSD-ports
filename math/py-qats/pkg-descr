QATS is a Python library and GUI for efficient processing and visualization
of time series.

QATS provides tools for:
* Import and export from/to various pre-defined time series file formats
* Signal processing
* Inferring statistical distributions
* Cycle counting using the Rainflow algorithm

It was originally created to handle time series files exported from SIMO and
RIFLEX. Now it also handles SIMA hdf5 (.h5) files, Matlab (version < 7.3)
.mat files, CSV files and more.

QATS also features a GUI which offers efficient and low threshold processing
and visualization of time series. It is perfect for inspecting, comparing and
reporting:
* time series
* power spectral density distributions
* peak and extreme distributions
* cycle distributions
