KaHIP - Karlsruhe High Quality Partitioning - is a family of graph
partitioning programs. It includes KaFFPa (Karlsruhe Fast Flow
Partitioner), which is a multilevel graph partitioning algorithm, in
its variants Strong, Eco and Fast, KaFFPaE (KaFFPaEvolutionary) which
is a parallel evolutionary algorithm that uses KaFFPa to provide
combine and mutation operations, as well as KaBaPE which extends the
evolutionary algorithm. Moreover, specialized techniques are included
to partition road networks (Buffoon), to output a vertex separator
from a given partition or techniques geared towards efficient
partitioning of social networks.
