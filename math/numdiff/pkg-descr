Numdiff is a little program that can be used to compare putatively
similar files line by line and field by field, ignoring small numeric
differences or/and different numeric formats.

Equivalently, Numdiff is a program with the capability to appropriately
compare files containing numerical fields (and not only).

% numdiff file1 file2
