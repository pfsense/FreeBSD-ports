ParMETIS is an MPI-based parallel library that implements a variety
of algorithms for partitioning unstructured graphs and for computing
fill-reducing orderings of sparse matrices. ParMETIS extends the
functionality provided by METIS and includes routines that are
especially suited for parallel AMR computations and large scale
numerical simulations. The algorithms implemented in ParMETIS are
based on the parallel multilevel k-way graph-partitioning algorithms
described in [KK95d], [KK96], [KK97], and the adaptive repartitioning
algorithms described in [SKK97a], [SKK97b], [SK+98], and [SKK98].
