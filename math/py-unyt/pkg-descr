A package for handling numpy arrays with units.

Often writing code that deals with data that has units can be confusing.
A function might return an array but at least with plain NumPy arrays, there is
no way to easily tell what the units of the data are without somehow knowing a
priori.

The unyt package (pronounced like "unit") provides a subclass of NumPy's ndarray
class that knows about units.
