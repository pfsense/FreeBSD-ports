PyTensor is a fork of Aesara - a Python library that allows one to define,
optimize, and efficiently evaluate mathematical expressions involving
multi-dimensional arrays.

Features:
* A hackable, pure-Python codebase
* Extensible graph framework suitable for rapid development of custom operators
  and symbolic optimizations
* Implements an extensible graph transpilation framework that currently provides
  compilation via C, JAX, and Numba
* Based on one of the most widely-used Python tensor libraries: Theano
