This is a Python implementation of Seriation algorithm. Seriation is
an approach for ordering elements in a set so that the sum of the sequential
pairwise distances is minimal. We state this task as a Travelling Salesman
Problem (TSP) and leverage the powerful Google's or-tools to do heavy-lifting.
Since TSP is NP-hard, it is not possible to calculate the precise solution for
a big number of elements. However, the or-tools' heuristics work very well in
practice, and they are used in e.g. Google Maps.
