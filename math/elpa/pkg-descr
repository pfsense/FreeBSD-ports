The ELPA library provides highly efficient and highly scalable direct
eigensolvers for symmetric matrices. Though especially designed for use for
PetaFlop/s applications solving large problem sizes on massively parallel
supercomputers, ELPA eigensolvers have proven to be also very efficient for
smaller matrices.
