Creme is an implementation of the randomized thermal relaxation method to find
a feasible solution of the Maximum Feasible Subsystem (MaxFS) problem. The MaxFS
problem consists, given a Linear Programming problem

A x <= b,

generally infeasible, in finding a feasible subsystem containing a maximum
number of inequalities.
