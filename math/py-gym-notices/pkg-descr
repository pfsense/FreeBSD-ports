Gym notices may be displayed on import on internet connected systems, in order
to give notices if versions have major reproducibility issues, are very old and
need to be upgraded, or other similar issues. If you're using a current version
of Gym and nothing extraordinary happens, you'll never see a message from this,
but I want start including the option to prevent future issues. By pulling the
error messages from a public git repository, there's absolute transparency and
versioning in the process.
