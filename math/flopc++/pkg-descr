FlopC++ is an open-source algebraic modeling language implemented as a C++
class library. It is a part of the COIN-OR project and allows users to
formulate linear optimization problems (LP/MIP) in a declarative style
directly within a C++ program, similar to established algebraic modeling
languages like GAMS and AMPL.

To achieve independence from specific solvers, FlopC++ utilizes the COIN
Open Solver Interface (OSI). This allows it to be linked with any solver
that has an OSI interface, such as CLP, CPLEX, GLPK, and XPRESS-MP.
