CLooG is a free software and library generating loops for scanning
Z-polyhedra. That is, it finds a code (e.g. in C, FORTRAN...) that
reaches each integral point of one or more parameterized polyhedra.
CLooG has been originally written to solve the code generation problem
for optimizing compilers based on the polytope model.
