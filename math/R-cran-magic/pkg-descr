A collection of efficient, vectorized algorithms for the creation
and investigation of magic squares and hypercubes, including a
variety of functions for the manipulation and analysis of arbitrarily
dimensioned arrays. The package includes methods for creating normal
magic squares of any order greater than 2. The ultimate intention
is for the package to be a computerized embodiment all magic square
knowledge, including direct numerical verification of properties
of magic squares (such as recent results on the determinant of
odd-ordered semimagic squares). Some antimagic functionality is
included. The package also serves as a rebuttal to the often-heard
comment "I thought R was just for statistics".
