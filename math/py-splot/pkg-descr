splot provides PySAL users with a lightweight visualization interface to explore
their data and quickly iterate through static and dynamic visualisations.

splot connects spatial analysis done in PySAL to different popular visualization
toolkits like matplotlib. The splot package allows you to create both static
plots ready for publication and interactive visualizations for quick iteration
and spatial data exploration. The primary goal of splot is to enable you to
visualize popular PySAL objects and gives you different views on your spatial
analysis workflow.
