plantri and fullgen are programs for generation of certain types of planar
graph.

Exactly one member of each isomorphism class is output, using an amount of
memory almost independent of the number of graphs produced. This, together with
the exceptionally fast operation and careful validation, makes the program
suitable for processing very large numbers of graphs.

Isomorphisms are defined with respect to the embeddings, so in some cases
outputs may be isomorphic as abstract graphs.
