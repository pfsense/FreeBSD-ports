LattE (Lattice point Enumeration) is a computer software dedicated to the
problems of counting lattice points and integration inside convex polytopes.
LattE contains the first ever implementation of Barvinok's algorithm. The LattE
macchiato version (by M. Koppe) incorporated fundamental improvements and
speedups.

LattE integrale, the latest version, has the ability to directly compute
integrals of polynomial functions over polytopes and in particular to do exact
volume computations. Version 1.6 adds the capability of computing the highest
coefficients of weighted Ehrhart quasipolynomials.
