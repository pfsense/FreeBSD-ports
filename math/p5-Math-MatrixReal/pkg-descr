p5-MatrixReal is port of the perl module Math::MatrixReal, implementing a
matrix of Reals.

Math::MatrixReal needs support for operator overloading to support
operations on matrixes as though they were just another basic perl type.

In addition to the basics (+, -, *) also supported are:

matrix norm, matrix transposition, matrix inverse, determinant of a
matrix, order and numerical condition of a matrix, scalar product of
vectors, vector product of vectors, vector length, projection of row and
column vectors, a comfortable way for reading in a matrix from a file, the
keyboard or your code, solving linear equations, etc.

It also has an implementation of Kleene's algorithm for finding minimal
costs for paths in a graph.
