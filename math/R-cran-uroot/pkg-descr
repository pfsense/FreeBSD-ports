Seasonal unit roots and seasonal stability tests. P-values based
on response surface regressions are available for both tests.
P-values based on bootstrap are available for seasonal unit root
tests. A parallel implementation of the bootstrap method requires
a CUDA capable GPU with compute capability >= 3.0, otherwise a
debugging version fully coded in R is used.
