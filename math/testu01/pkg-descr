TestU01 is a software library, implemented in the ANSI C language, and
offering a collection of utilities for the empirical statistical testing
of uniform random number generators.

The library implements several types of random number generators in generic
form, as well as many specific generators proposed in the literature or
found in widely-used software. It provides general implementations of the
classical statistical tests for random number generators, as well as several
others proposed in the literature, and some original ones. These tests can
be applied to the generators predefined in the library and to user-defined
generators. Specific tests suites for either sequences of uniform random
numbers in [0,1] or bit sequences are also available. Basic tools for
plotting vectors of points produced by generators are provided as well.

Additional software permits one to perform systematic studies of the
interaction between a specific test and the structure of the point sets
produced by a given family of random number generators. That is, for a given
kind of test and a given class of random number generators, to determine how
large should be the sample size of the test, as a function of the generator's
period length, before the generator starts to fail the test systematically.
