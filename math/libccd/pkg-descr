libccd is library for a collision detection between two convex shapes. libccd
implements variation on Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm plus Expand Polytope
Algorithm (EPA) and also implements algorithm Minkowski Portal Refinement (MPR,
a.k.a. XenoCollide) as described in Game Programming Gems 7.

libccd is the only available open source library of my knowledge that include
MPR algorithm working in 3-D space. However, there is a library called mpr2d,
implemented in D programming language, that works in 2-D space.
