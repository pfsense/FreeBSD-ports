Matrix is an implementation of Matrix and Vector classes.

The Matrix class represents a mathematical matrix. It provides methods for
creating matrices, operating on them arithmetically and algebraically, and
determining their mathematical properties (trace, rank, inverse, determinant,
eigensystem, etc.).

The Vector class represents a mathematical vector, which is useful in its own
right, and also constitutes a row or column of a Matrix.
