Glucose is based on the MiniSat solver, and extends it by preserving
the so-called "glue clauses" and using new scoring scheme.

Glucose is a SAT solver based on a particular scoring scheme for the clause
learning mechanism, based on the paper Laurent Simon and Gilles Audemard
presented at IJCAI'09. Solver's name is a contraction of the concept of
"glue clauses", a particular kind of clauses that glucose detects and preserves
during search.

Glucose accepts SAT problems in the DIMACS format.
