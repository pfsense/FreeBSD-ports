The ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) project is an ongoing
research effort focusing on applying empirical techniques in order to provide
portable performance.  At present, it provides C and Fortran77 interfaces to
a portable, efficient BLAS implementation, as well as enhanced versions of a
few routines from LAPACK.  To link with ATLAS shared libraries:

Serial (thread-safe) Fortran77 BLAS:
	-lf77blas
Multi-threaded Fortran77 BLAS:
	-lptf77blas
Serial (thread-safe) C BLAS:
	-lcblas
Multi-threaded C BLAS:
	-lptcblas
ATLAS-enhanced LAPACK, serial (thread-safe) interface:
	-lalapack -lf77blas -lcblas
ATLAS-enhanced LAPACK, multi-threaded interface:
	-lalapack -lptf77blas -lptcblas
