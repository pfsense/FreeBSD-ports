Zelig is an easy-to-use program that can estimate, and help interpret the
results of, an enormous range of statistical models. It literally is "everyone's
statistical software" because Zelig's simple unified framework incorporates
everyone else's (R) code. We also hope it will become "everyone's statistical
software" for applications and teaching, and so have designed Zelig so that
anyone can easily use it or add their programs to it. Zelig also comes with
infrastructure that facilitates the use of any existing method, such as by
allowing multiply imputed data for any model, and mimicking the program Clarify
(for Stata) that takes the raw output of existing statistical procedures and
translates them into quantities of direct interest.
