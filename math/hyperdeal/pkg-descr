hyper.deal is an efficient, matrix-free finite-element library for solving
partial differential equations in two to six dimensions with high-order
discontinuous Galerkin methods. It builds upon the low-dimensional
finite-element library deal.II to create low-dimensional meshes and to
operate on them individually. We combine these meshes via a tensor product
on the fly and provide new special-purpose highly optimized matrix-free
functions.
