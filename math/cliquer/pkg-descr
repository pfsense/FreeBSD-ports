Cliquer is a set of C routines for finding cliques in an arbitrary weighted
graph. It uses an exact branch-and-bound algorithm developed by Patric
Ostergard. It is designed with the aim of being efficient while still being
flexible and easy to use.

Note: this port do not use the upstream version, but the version autotoolized
by Dima Pasechnik.
