Automatic theorem proving has a number of important applications, such as
software verification, hardware verification, hardware design, knowledge
representation and reasoning, the Semantic Web, algebra, and proving theorems
in mathematics. Over 50 years of research in theorem proving have resulted in
one of the most advanced and elegant theories in computer science. This area is
an ideal target for scientific engineering: implementation techniques have to be
developed to realise an advanced theory in practically valuable tools.
