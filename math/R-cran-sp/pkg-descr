R-sp is a package that provides classes and methods for spatial
data. The classes document where the spatial location information
resides, for 2D or 3D data. Utility functions are provided, e.g.
for plotting data as maps, spatial selection, as well as methods
for retrieving coordinates, for subsetting, print, summary, etc.
