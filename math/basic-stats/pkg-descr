Basic-stats is a command-line tool to perform basic statistics on a
tabular data stream.  It supports performing multiple functions such as
mean, median, etc. on independent rows and/or columns during a single
pass on independent rows and/or columns.  Memory use is trivial except
for functions that require loading the sample/population for sorting,
such as median.
