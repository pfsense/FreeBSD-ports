The purpose of dSFMT is to speed up the generation by avoiding the expensive
conversion of integer to double (floating point). dSFMT directly generates
double precision floating point pseudorandom numbers which have the IEEE
Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic (ANSI/IEEE Std 754-1985) format.

dSFMT is only available on the CPUs which use IEEE 754 format double precision
floating point numbers.
