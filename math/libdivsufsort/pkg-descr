libdivsufsort is a software library that implements a lightweight suffix array
construction algorithm.

This library provides a simple and an efficient C API to construct a suffix
array and a Burrows-Wheeler transformed string from a given string over a
constant-size alphabet. The algorithm runs in O(n log n) worst-case time using
only 5n+O(1) bytes of memory space, where n is the length of the string.
