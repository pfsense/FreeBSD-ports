LinBox is a C++ template library for exact, high-performance linear algebra
computation with dense, sparse, and structured matrices over the integers and
over finite fields.

LinBox relies on closely aligned libraries fflas-ffpack (exact dense matrix
linear algebra kernels), and Givaro (finite fields, integers, and polynomials).
