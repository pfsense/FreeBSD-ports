half is a C++ header-only library to provide an IEEE 754 conformant 16-bit
half-precision floating-point type along with corresponding arithmetic
operators, type conversions and common mathematical functions. It aims for
both efficiency and ease of use, trying to accurately mimic the behaviour of
the built-in floating-point types at the best performance possible.
