Spatial Interaction Modeling Package

The Spatial Interaction Modeling (SpInt) module seeks to provide a collection of
tools to study spatial interaction processes and analyze spatial interaction
data.

The module currently supports the calibration of the 'family' of spatial
interaction models (Wilson, 1971) which are derived using an entropy maximizing
(EM) framework or the equivalent information minimizing (IM) framework. As such,
it is able to derive parameters for the following Poisson count models:
- unconstrained gravity model
- production-constrained model (origin-constrained)
- attraction-constrained model (destination-constrained)
- doubly-constrained model
