Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL.
It combines the power of many existing open-source packages into a common
Python-based interface.

Mission: Creating a viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple,
Mathematica and Matlab.

For instructions on adding optional packages, see files/optional-packages.txt.

You may want to avoid the command "make install" and instead simply use the
bin/mv command to move the ${WRKSRC} directory to where-ever you want it.
