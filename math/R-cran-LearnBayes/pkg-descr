LearnBayes contains a collection of functions helpful in learning
the basic tenets of Bayesian statistical inference. It contains
functions for summarizing basic one and two parameter posterior
distributions and predictive distributions. It contains MCMC
algorithms for summarizing posterior distributions defined by the
user. It also contains functions for regression models, hierarchical
models, Bayesian tests, and illustrations of Gibbs sampling.
