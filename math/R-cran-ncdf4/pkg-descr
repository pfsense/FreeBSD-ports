Provides a high-level R interface to data files written using Unidata's
netCDF library (version 4 or earlier), which are binary data files that
are portable across platforms and include metadata information in addition
to the data sets. Using this package, netCDF files (either version 4 or
"classic" version 3) can be opened and data sets read in easily. It is
also easy to create new netCDF dimensions, variables, and files, in either
version 3 or 4 format, and manipulate existing netCDF files.
