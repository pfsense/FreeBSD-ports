OpenTURNS is a scientific C++ and Python library including an internal data
model and algorithms dedicated to the treatment of uncertainties. The main goal
of this library is giving to specific applications all the functionalities
needed to treat uncertainties in studies. Targeted users are all engineers who
want to introduce the probabilistic dimension in their so far deterministic
studies.
