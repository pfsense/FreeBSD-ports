dune-fem is a module of the DUNE Numerics framework for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods.

dune-fem is a Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment module which defines
interfaces for implementing discretization methods like Finite Element Methods
(FEM) and Finite Volume Methods (FV) and Discontinuous Galerkin Methods (DG).
