dune-foamgrid is a module of the DUNE Numerics framework for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods.

dune-foamgrid implements one- and two-dimensional simplex grids, which can be
embedded in Euclidean spaces of arbitrary dimension. As a special feature,
FoamGrid does not require the grids to be manifolds and grid can add/remove
elements art run-time.
