This code project provides a library for implementing graph algorithms as well
as implementations of several planarity-related graph algorithms. The origin of
this project is the reference implementation for the Edge Addition Planarity
Algorithm, which is now the fastest and simplest linear-time method for
planar graph embedding and planarity obstruction isolation (i.e. Kuratowski
subgraph isolation).
