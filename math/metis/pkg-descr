METIS is a set of serial programs for partitioning graphs,
partitioning finite element meshes, and producing fill-reducing
orderings for sparse matrices. The algorithms implemented in METIS are
based on the multilevel recursive-bisection, multilevel k-way, and
multi-constraint partitioning schemes developed in our lab.

METIS provides high-quality partitions, is extremely fast, and
produces low-fill orderings.
