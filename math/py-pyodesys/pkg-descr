pyodesys provides a straightforward way of numerically integrating systems of
ordinary differential equations (initial value problems). It unifies the
interface of several libraries for performing the numerical integration as well
as several libraries for symbolic representation. It also provides a convenience
class for representing and integrating ODE systems defined by symbolic
expressions, e.g. SymPy expressions. This allows the user to write concise code
and rely on pyodesys to handle the subtle differences between libraries.

The numerical integration is performed using either:
* scipy.integrate.ode
* pygslodeiv2
* pyodeint
* pycvodes
