Arybo is a software for manipulating canonicalization and identification of
mixed boolean-arithmetic symbolic expressions using bit vectors and gives a
bit-per-bit symbolic representation.

The ANF (Algebric Normal Form) form is used, which basically represents boolean
expressions using the XOR and AND operators.
