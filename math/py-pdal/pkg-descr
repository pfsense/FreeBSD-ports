PDAL Python support allows you to process data with PDAL into Numpy arrays.
It supports embedding Python in PDAL pipelines with the readers.numpy and
filters.python stages, and it provides a PDAL extension module to control
Python interaction with PDAL.

Additionally, you can use it to fetch schema and metadata from PDAL operations.
