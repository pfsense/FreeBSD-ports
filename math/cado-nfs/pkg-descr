CADO-NFS is a complete implementation in C/C++ of the Number Field Sieve (NFS)
algorithm for factoring integers and computing discrete logarithms in finite
fields. It consists in various programs corresponding to all the phases of the
algorithm, and a general script that runs them, possibly in parallel over a
network of computers.
