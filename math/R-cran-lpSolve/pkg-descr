Lp_solve is freely available (under LGPL 2) software for solving
linear, integer and mixed integer programs. In this implementation
we supply a "wrapper" function in C and some R functions that solve
general linear/integer problems, assignment problems, and transportation
problems. This version calls lp_solve version 5.5.
