R port of Angus Johnson's open source library 'Clipper'. Performs polygon
clipping operations (intersection, union, set minus, set difference) for
polygonal regions of arbitrary complexity, including holes. Computes offset
polygons (spatial buffer zones, morphological dilations, Minkowski dilations)
for polygonal regions and polygonal lines. Computes Minkowski Sum of general
polygons. There is a function for removing self-intersections from polygon data.
