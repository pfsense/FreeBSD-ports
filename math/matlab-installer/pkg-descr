This port installs the prerequisites for Mathworks (r) Matlab for Linux
and an installer script (matlab-installer), which automates the somewhat
tricky process of installing Linux Matlab.

Installing Matlab requires Matlab installation media and a license file and
installation key from Mathworks, Inc.
