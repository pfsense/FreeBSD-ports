Clad enables automatic differentiation (AD) for C++. It is based on LLVM
compiler infrastructure and is a plugin for Clang compiler. Clad is based on
source code transformation. Given C++ source code of a mathematical function, it
can automatically generate C++ code for computing derivatives of the function.
It supports both forward-mode and reverse-mode AD.Clad has extensive coverage of
modern C++ features and a robust fallback and recovery system in place.
