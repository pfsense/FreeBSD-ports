openTSNE is a modular Python implementation of t-Distributed Stochasitc Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE), a popular dimensionality-reduction algorithm for visualizing
high-dimensional data sets. openTSNE incorporates the latest improvements to the
t-SNE algorithm, including the ability to add new data points to existing
embeddings, massive speed improvements, enabling t-SNE to scale to millions of
data points and various tricks to improve global alignment of the resulting
visualizations.
