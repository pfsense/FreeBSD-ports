Spot is a library for LTL, omega-automata manipulation and model checking.

It has the following notable features:
* Support for LTL (several syntaxes supported) and a subset of the linear
  fragment of PSL.
* Support for omega-automata with arbitrary acceptance condition.
* Support for transition-based acceptance (state-based acceptance is supported
  by a reduction to transition-based acceptance).
* The automaton parser can read a stream of automata written in any of four
  syntaxes (HOA, never claims, LBTT, DSTAR).
* Several algorithms for formula manipulation including: simplifying formulas,
  testing implication or equivalence, testing stutter-invariance, removing some
  operators by rewriting, translation to automata, testing membership to the
  temporal hierarchy of Manna & Pnueli...
* Several algorithms for automata manipulation including: product, emptiness
  checks, simulation-based reductions, minimization of weak-DBA, removal of
  useless SCCs, acceptance-condition transformations, determinization, SAT-based
  minimization of deterministic automata, etc.
* In addition to the C++ interface, most of its algorithms are usable via
  command-line tools, and via Python bindings.
* One command-line tool, called ltlcross, is a rewrite of LBTT, but with support
  for PSL and automata with arbitrary acceptance conditions.
