This port installs the module CCOLAMD of SuiteSparse.

The CCOLAMD column approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm computes a
permutation vector P such that the LU factorization of A (:,P) tends to be
sparser than that of A. The Cholesky factorization of (A (:,P))'*(A (:,P)) will
also tend to be sparser than that of A'*A.  CSYMAMD is a symmetric minimum
degree ordering method based on CCOLAMD, also available as a MATLAB-callable
function. It constructs a matrix M such that M'*M has the same pattern as A, and
then uses CCOLAMD to compute a column ordering of M.
