ArviZ is a Python package for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models. Includes
functions for posterior analysis, sample diagnostics, model checking, and
comparison.

The goal is to provide backend-agnostic tools for diagnostics and visualizations
of Bayesian inference in Python, by first converting inference data into xarray
objects. See here for more on xarray and ArviZ usage and here for more on
InferenceData structure and specification.
