dune-localfunctions is a module of the DUNE Numerics framework for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods.

dune-localfunctions provides interface and implementation for shape functions
defined on the DUNE reference elements. In addition to the shape function,
interpolation operators and special keys are provided which can be used to
assemble global function spaces on finite-element grids.
