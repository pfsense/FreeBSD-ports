Math::Prime::Util::GMP is a module for number theory in Perl using GMP. This
includes primality tests, getting primes in a range, factoring, and more.

These use GMP directly, so should be quite fast for bignums. This module is
mainly intended to be used within Math::Prime::Util, but most functions can be
easily used in independent C programs. Some, like factoring and primality
proving, have explicit ways of compiling as standalone programs.
