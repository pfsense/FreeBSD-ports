jij-cimod provides Python bindings for cimod, a C++ library
that provides functionalities for handling binary quadratic
models (BQM) and polynomial quadratic models (PQM).

It allows Python developers to leverage its high-performance
C++ core for mathematical optimization problems, particularly
in fields like quantum annealing and combinatorial optimization.
