SymFPU is an implementation of the SMT-LIB / IEEE-754 operations in terms of
bit-vector operations. It is templated in terms of the bit-vectors,
propositions, floating-point formats and rounding mode types used. This allow
the same code to be executed as an arbitrary precision "SoftFloat" library
(although it's performance would not be good) or to be used to build symbolic
representation of floating-point operations suitable for use in "bit-blasting"
SMT solvers (you could also generate circuits from them but again, performance
will likely not be good).
