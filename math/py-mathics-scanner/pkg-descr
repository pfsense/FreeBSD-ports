This is a tokeniser or scanner portion for the Wolfram Language.

As such, it also contains a full set of translation between Wolfram Language
named characters, their Unicode/ASCII equivalents and code-points.

This is used as the scanner inside Mathics but it can also be used for
tokenizing and formatting Wolfram Language code. This library is also quite
usefull if you need to work with Wolfram Language named character and convert
them to various formats.
