mlpack is a fast, flexible machine learning library, written in
C++, that aims to provide fast, extensible implementations of
cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. mlpack provides these
algorithms as simple command-line programs, Python bindings, and
C++ classes which can then be integrated into larger-scale machine
learning solutions.
