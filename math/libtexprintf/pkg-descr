The utftex program and underlying libtexprintf library provide tools to pretty
print math in mono-space fonts, using a tex-like syntax. It produces UTF-8
encoded text. The program was inspired by asciiTeX, and the improved asciiTeX
fork. However, utftex supports much more TeX syntax and contains extensive
Unicode tables to map latex commands to Unicode symbols. Use libtexprintf/utftex
to unlock the math capabilities of Unicode in mono-space text applications.
