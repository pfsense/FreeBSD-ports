G+Smo (Geometry + Simulation Modules, pronounced "gismo") is an open-source C++
library that brings together mathematical tools for geometric design and
numerical simulation. It implements the relatively new paradigm of isogeometric
analysis, which suggests the use of a unified framework in the design and
analysis pipeline. G+Smo is an object-oriented, cross-platform, template C++
library and follows the generic programming principle, with a focus on both
efficiency and ease of use. The library aims at providing access to high
quality, open-source software to the forming isogeometric numerical simulation
community and beyond.
