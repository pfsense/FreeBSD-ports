The Polyhedral Library (PolyLib for short) operates on objects made up of
unions of polyhedra of any dimension. It was first developed by Doran Wilde at
IRISA, in Rennes, France, in connection with the ALPHA project. This first
version (1.1) manipulates non parameterized unions of polyhedra through the
following operations: intersection, difference, union, convex hull, simplify,
image and preimage, plus some input and output functions. The polyhedra are
computed in their dual implicit and Minkowski representations, in homogeneous
spaces.

Version 2 of the PolyLib included parameterized vertices computation.
PolyLib3.14 includes Ehrhart polynomials computation, which permits to count
the number of integer points contained in a parameterized polyhedron. PolyLib4
included the GNU MP library (as a compilation option), and 64 bits computations,
in order to avoid integer overflows. Polylib5 is a merge of Strasbourg, Rennes
and BYU Polylib.

There is also the 'visualpolylib' project that permits to use the PolyLib
interactively.
