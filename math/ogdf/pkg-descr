OGDF (Open Graph Drawing Framework) is a self-contained C++ class library for
the automatic layout of diagrams. OGDF offers sophisticated algorithms and data
structures to use within your own applications or scientific projects.
The library provides:

* A wide range of graph drawing algorithms that allow to reuse and replace
  particular algorithm phases by using a dedicated module mechanism.
* Sophisticated data structures that are commonly used in graph drawing,
  equipped with rich public interfaces.
* Self-contained code that does not require any additional libraries
  (except for some optional branch-and-cut algorithms).
