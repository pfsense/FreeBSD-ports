This is HPIPM, a high-performance interior-point method solver for dense,
optimal control- and tree-structured convex quadratic programs. It provides
efficient implementations of dense and structure-exploiting algorithms to solve
small to medium scale problems arising in model predictive control and embedded
optimization in general and it relies on the high-performance linear algebra
package BLASFEO.
