The SCOREC Core is a set of C/C++ libraries for unstructured mesh simulations
on supercomputers.

This project contains:
* PUMI: parallel unstructured mesh infrastructure API User's Guide
* PCU: Communication and file IO built on MPI
* APF: Abstract definition of meshes, fields, and related operations
* GMI: Common interface for geometric modeling kernels
* MDS: Compact but flexible array-based mesh data structure
* PARMA: Scalable partitioning and load balancing procedures
* SPR: Superconvergent Patch Recovery error estimator
* MA: Anisotropic mixed mesh adaptation and solution transfer
* SAM: Sizing anisotropic meshes
* STK: Conversion from APF meshes to Sandia's STK meshes
* ZOLTAN: Interface to run Sandia's Zoltan code on APF meshes
* PHASTA: Tools and file formats related to the PHASTA fluid solver
* MTH: Math containers and routines
* CRV: Support for curved meshes with Bezier Shapes
* PYCORE: Python Wrappers
* REE: Residual based implicit error estimator
