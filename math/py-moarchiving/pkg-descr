The Python class moarchiving.BiobjectiveNondominatedSortedList implements a
bi-objective non-dominated archive with list as parent class. It is heavily
based on the bisect module. It provides easy and fast access to the overall
hypervolume, the contributing hypervolume of each element, and to the uncrowded
hypervolume improvement of any given point in objective space.
