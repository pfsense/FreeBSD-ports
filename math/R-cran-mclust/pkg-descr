An R package implementing Gaussian Mixture Modelling for Model-Based Clustering,
Classification, and Density Estimation.

Gaussian finite mixture models fitted via EM algorithm for model-based
clustering, classification, and density estimation, including Bayesian
regularization, dimension reduction for visualization, and resampling-based
inference.
