Mathics is a general-purpose computer algebra system (CAS).
It is an open-source alternative to Mathematica.

This port/package provides Mathics Core, with a very rudimentary command-line
shell called mathics.

Note: since release 2.0.0, mathicsscript (a text interface) and mathics-django
are no more included, and must be installed separately.
