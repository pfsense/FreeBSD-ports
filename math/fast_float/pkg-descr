The fast_float library provides fast header-only implementations for the C++
from_chars functions for float and double types. These functions convert ASCII
strings representing decimal values (e.g., 1.3e10) into binary types. We provide
exact rounding (including round to even). In our experience, these fast_float
functions many times faster than comparable number-parsing functions from
existing C++ standard libraries.
