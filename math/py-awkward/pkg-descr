Awkward Array is a library for nested, variable-sized data, including
arbitrary-length lists, records, mixed types, and missing data, using NumPy-like
idioms.

Arrays are dynamically typed, but operations on them are compiled and fast.
Their behavior coincides with NumPy when array dimensions are regular and
generalizes when they're not.
