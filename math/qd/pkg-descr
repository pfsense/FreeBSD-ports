A Double-Double and Quad-Double Arithmetic library.
Double-double and quad-double numbers are unevaluated sum of
two and four IEEE doubles capable of representing 106 and 212 bits
of significand, respectively. The library is written in C++, taking full
advantage of operator overloading. C, Fortran 77, and Fortran 90 interfaces
are also provided.
