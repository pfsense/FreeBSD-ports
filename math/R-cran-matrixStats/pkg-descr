High-performing functions operating on rows and columns of matrices,
e.g. col / rowMedians(), col / rowRanks(), and col / rowSds().
Functions optimized per data type and for subsetted calculations
such that both memory usage and processing time is minimized. There
are also optimized vector-based methods, e.g. binMeans(), madDiff()
and weightedMedian().
