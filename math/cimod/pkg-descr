Cimod is a C++ header-only library for a binary quadratic model (BQM),
which is a model of variables that can be in one of two states (0 or 1,
or -1 or 1). BQMs are used to represent a wide range of optimization
problems, and are particularly important in the context of quantum
annealing and other heuristic optimization algorithms.

This library provides tools to create and manipulate BQM instances,
making it easier to work with these models in C++ applications.
