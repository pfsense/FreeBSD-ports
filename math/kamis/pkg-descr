KaMIS (Karlsruhe Maximum Independent Sets) is an open source project
finding maximum independent sets and vertex covers of large sparse
graphs.

Given a graph G=(V,E), the goal of the maximum independent set problem
is to compute a maximum cardinality set of vertices I, such that no
vertices in the set are adjacent to one another. Such a set is called
a maximum independent set. The problem is NP-hard and particularly
difficult to solve in large sparse graphs.
