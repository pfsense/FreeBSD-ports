Libisoburn is a front-end for libraries libburn and libisofs of
the libburnia project.

Xorriso copies file objects from POSIX compliant filesystems into
Rock Ridge enhanced ISO 9660 filesystems and allows session-wise
manipulation of such filesystems. It can load the management
information of existing ISO images and it writes the session results
to optical media or to filesystem objects.  Vice versa xorriso is
able to restore file objects from ISO 9660 filesystems.
