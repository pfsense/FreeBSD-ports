Calamares is a distro- and desktop-agnostic installer. Developed as an
installer for Linux distributions -- dozens of them -- it is modular
and highly configurable. It can be used as an installer for FreeBSD-
based distributions as well, though it needs extensive configuration
(which is not included in the port yet).

Upstream tracking of what still needs tweaking can be found at
