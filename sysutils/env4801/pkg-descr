Soekris Net4801 Environmental Monitor

This is a small program to output the voltages and temperatures
from the PC87366 chip in the Net4801 computer from Soekris.com.

First run the program with a "-i" to initialize the hardware:

	# env4801 -i

Then, as often as you feel like, read out the measured values:

	# env4801
