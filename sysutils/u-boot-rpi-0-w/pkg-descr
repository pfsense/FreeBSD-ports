U-Boot loader for Raspberry Pi

To install this bootloader, copy u-boot.bin in the share/u-boot/u-boot-rpi-0-w
directory to the first partition, formatted as FAT16 or FAT32, on an SD card.
You will also need the firmware files and configs from the rpi-firmware package.

This version is patched so that:
 * API features are enabled.
 * U-Boot and FreeBSD kernel are using rpi-firmware DTBs
 * A boot.scr (U-Boot script) that loads ubldr.bin and execute it is included
