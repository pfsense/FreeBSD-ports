  message: <<EOM
Many of the DTraceToolkit scripts do not work on FreeBSD at the moment,
usually because:
- They are using Solaris-specific features
- They use probes which are not supported yet on FreeBSD

Some popular scripts are installed at:

    %%PREFIX%%/bin

The rest of the scripts and other toolkit files can be found in:

    %%DATADIR%%

To view the manual pages in the "1m" manual section,
the section has to be specified explicitly, e.g.:

    man -s 1m fddist
EOM
