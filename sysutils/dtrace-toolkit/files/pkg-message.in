  message: <<EOM
Some of the DTrace Toolkit scripts are installed at:

    %%PREFIX%%/bin

Their manual pages are installed into the standard manual page directories
as defined in hier(7).

The rest of the scripts and other toolkit files can be found in:

    %%DATADIR%%

The DTrace Toolkit documents those programs in a manual section "1m".
Use the -S flag to access this non-standard section:

    man -S 1m fddist

Note that some of the DTrace Toolkit scripts have not been ported
to the currently supported FreeBSD versions yet.
