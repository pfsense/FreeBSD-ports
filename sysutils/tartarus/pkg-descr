Tartarus provides a nice wrapper around basic Unix tools such as tar, find and
curl (well, that's not that basic) to provide a seamless backup solution,
aimed at automatic gathering and backup.

It has the ability to do full as well as incremental backups and is published
by Stefan Tomanek under the rules of the GPL.

Instead of relying on single usage backup scripts or complicated command lines,
tartarus reads its configuration from easily manageable configuration files.
It can store gathered data in regular files, or upload the backup directly (on
the fly) to an FTP server. For more specific usage scenarios, custom methods
can also be defined within the config file.
