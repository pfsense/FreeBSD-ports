u(ser)cored applies policy to user cores being produced on the system

This utility allows configurable actions to be enacted on user coredumps
produced on the system.  ucored(8) brings functionality to FreeBSD that is
similar to the coredump piping that Linux offers, but with the flexibility to
be scripted with Lua or made conditional on various properties of the coredump
itself.
