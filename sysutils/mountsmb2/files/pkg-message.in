*B*E*F*O*R*E* the FIRST RUN of Mountsmb2!

In order to run Mountsmb2 properly, be sure that:

1. Your kernel is configured properly
2. Your /etc/nsmb.conf file is configured properly
3. Your .nsmbrc file is configured properly (this means, that
   the password to *ANY* server in your network is recorded in
   this file. For semi-automatic creation of .nsmbrc you can use
   the smb2nsmbrc script)
4. Your .mssmbrc file is created and filled properly

Keep in mind, that:

1. Mountsmb2 only calls mount_smbfs to mount shares with params, described in
   a .mssmbrc file
2. DO NOT DISTURB ME ABOUT FreeBSD's SMB IMPLEMENTATION!
