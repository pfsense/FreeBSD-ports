This is the distribution of "cpdup", a powerful filesystem mirroring and
backup utility which also has file integrity testing features, supports
incremental backups, and remote mirroring via ssh.

Note: This port does not copy (or mirror) any FreeBSD supported ACL
types and Extended Attributes nor MAC labels.
