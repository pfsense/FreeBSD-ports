Plasma Pass is a Plasma applet to access password from pass, the standard UNIX
password manager.

More details and a video in my blog post about Plasma Pass.

You don't need the pass utility installed on your system in order for Plasma
Pass to work, only GnuPG is needed in order to be able to decrypt the password.

Plasma Pass looks for the password directory by default in
$HOME/.password-store, but it can be customized through PASSWORD_STORE_DIR
environment variable.
