Backdown helps you safely and ergonomically remove duplicate files.

Its design is based upon the authors observation of frequent patterns
regarding build-up of duplicates with time, especially images and other
media files.

Finding duplicates is easy. Cleaning the disk when there are thousands
of them is the hard part. What Backdown brings is the easy way to select
and remove the duplicates you don't want to keep.
