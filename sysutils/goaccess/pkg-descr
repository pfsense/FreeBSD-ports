 GoAccess is an open source real-time web log analyzer and interactive
 viewer that runs in a terminal or through your browser.

 It can parse a variety of web log formats, including common and
 combined log formats, caddy JSON, and many more. Because it is a log
 parser, it does not inject anything into your website and does not
 require any scripts or weird 1-pixel images.

 GoAccess outputs HTML full of analytics, or runs interactively in
 console, continually updated via websockets.
