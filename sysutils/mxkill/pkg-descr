mxkill is a X/Motif interface to ps. Inspired by xzap by
gerry.tomlinson@ncl.ac.uk. xzap is an X Athena widget version
of the zap command described in Kernighan &l Pike's "The Unix
Programming Environment". I am not a big fan of Athena widget
set, so I had to write it in Motif.

This port requires Motif or equivalent to build.
