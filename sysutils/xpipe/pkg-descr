The xpipe command reads input from stdin and splits it by the given number of
bytes, lines, or if matching the given pattern. It then invokes the given
utility repeatedly, feeding it the generated data chunks as input. You can
think of it as a Unix love-child of the split(1), tee(1), and xargs(1)
commands.
