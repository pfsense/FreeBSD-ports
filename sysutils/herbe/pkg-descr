herbe provides daemon-less notifications without D-Bus. It's meant to be
minimal and lightweight.

Some of its features are:

- Under 200 lines of code
- Doesn't run in the background, just displays the notification and exits
- No external dependencies except Xlib and Xft
- Configurable through config.h or Xresources
- Actions support
- Extensible through patches
