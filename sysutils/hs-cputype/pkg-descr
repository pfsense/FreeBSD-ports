This small utility can help figuring out proper value for CPUTYPE variable used
by FreeBSD build machinery in src and ports Makefiles. It uses clang for this
and checks its output against bsd.cpu.mk file. It also allows you to list CPU
features, and compare between several CPUs to find out which one is most featured.
