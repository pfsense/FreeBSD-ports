cdrkit is a suite of programs for recording CDs and DVDs, blanking CD-RW media,
creating ISO-9660 filesystem images, extracting audio CD data, and more. The
programs included in the cdrkit package were originally derived from several
sources, most notably mkisofs by Eric Youngdale and others, cdda2wav by Heiko
Eissfeldt, and cdrecord by Joerg Schilling. However, cdrkit is not affiliated
with any of these authors; it is now an independent project.
