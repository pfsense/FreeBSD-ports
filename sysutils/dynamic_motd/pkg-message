The ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.motd script is responsible for generating content for
/var/run/motd on each login. A sample script is provided in
${PREFIX}/etc/rc.motd.sample that emulates the default motd(5) behavior.
More extensive examples can be found in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/dynamic_motd.

To enable the dynamic_motd service, update_motd should be disabled in
/etc/rc.conf as it is no longer needed at system startup:

    # sysrc update_motd="NO"

The dynamic_motd service can then be enabled by issuing:

    # sysrc dynamic_motd="YES"
    # service dynamic_motd start

Note: ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.motd can be updated without restarting the
dynamic_motd service; changes are automatically picked up on next login.
