plocate is a locate(1) based on posting lists, completely replacing mlocate
with a much faster (and smaller) index. It is suitable as a default locate on
your system.  Like mlocate and slocate, the returned file set is
user-dependent, ie. a user will only see a file if find(1) would list it (all
directories from the root have +rx permissions).
