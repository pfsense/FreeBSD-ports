rename renames the filenames supplied according to the rule specified as the
first argument. The perlexpr argument is a Perl expression which is expected
to modify the $_ string in Perl for at least some of the filenames specified.
If a given filename is not modified by the expression, it will not be renamed.
If no filenames are given on the command line, filenames will be read via
standard input.
