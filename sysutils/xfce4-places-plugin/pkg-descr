The xfce4-places-plugin brings much of the functionality of the GNOME Places
menu to Xfce. The plugin looks a lot like a launcher with multiple items in a
menu. The main "launcher" button opens up Thunar at the user's home directory.
The arrow button opens up a menu with two sections: system- and user-defined
locations. The system-defined locations are consistent with Thunar (including
their icons). For user-defined bookmarks, the ~/.gtk-bookmarks file is being
read in order to share bookmarks with Thunar, Nautilus, the GNOME Panel, etc.
