A community developed provider to support gridscale's cloud with Terraform.

Terraform is used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as
physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more.
Almost any infrastructure type can be represented as a resource in Terraform.

A provider is responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing
resources. Providers generally are an IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS services.
