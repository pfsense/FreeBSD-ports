UEFI EDK2 firmware for bhyve.

From https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore/wiki/UEFI :
"The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, or UEFI, specifies the
firmware layer between an operating system and platform hardware. UEFI
replaces the legacy Basic Input Output System (BIOS)."

EDK2 is the project from TianoCore (https://tianocore.org) that provides
"a modern, feature-rich, cross-platform development environment for the
UEFI and UEFI Platform Initialization (PI) specifications."

It's open source under the BSD-2-Clause-Patent license.

This port provides a version of EDK2 for use with VMs running
operating systems which have UEFI support.
