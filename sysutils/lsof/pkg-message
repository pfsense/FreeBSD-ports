  message: <<EOD
NOTE: Due to the way the FreeBSD build clusters make packages,
you may see a warning similar to the following:

lsof: WARNING: compiled for FreeBSD release 11.1-RELEASE-p6; this is 11.1-RELEASE-p4.

This is because the poudriere jails that build the packages don't have the  
corresponding kernel installed, so they don't know that the kernel version is different.

This warning can be ignored if you are using a system that is updated via freebsd-update
and are using pre-built packages.
