When upgrading to Azure CLI v2.31.0, you will need to re-authenticate on Azure
services.

  $ az login --use-device-code

Starting in version 2.30.0, Azure CLI uses MSAL as the underlying
authentication library. MSAL uses AAD v2.0 authentication flow to provide more
functionality and increases security for token cache.
