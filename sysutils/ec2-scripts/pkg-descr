This package provides boot scripts used to enable FreeBSD to run on the
Amazon EC2 cloud computing platform.  These include:
 * Downloading the SSH public key which will be used to log in to a
   newly-launched virtual machine,
 * Printing SSH host key fingerprints to the console in a standard
   format used by other EC2 images,
 * Automatically configuring swap space on EC2 "ephemeral" disks, and
 * Sending email when an virtual machine first boots and when rebooting
   after a kernel panic.
