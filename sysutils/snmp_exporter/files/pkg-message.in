Upstream's default configuration file has been installed as
%%ETCDIR%%/snmp.yml.
This configuration is suitable for most situations.

To generate a custom configuration, use the configuration generator:
edit %%ETCDIR%%/generator.yml as required, then run

    snmp_exporter_generator generate

To run snmp_exporter, set the snmp_exporter_enable="YES" rcvar
and point your prometheus instance at port 9116.

BREAKING CHANGES:

In snmp_exporter 0.28.0 (actually, since 0.23.0 upstream), the configuration
format for authentication has changed.  The previous configuration will not
work and must be updated.  Please refer to the upstream documentation on how to
migrate:

    https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter/blob/main/auth-split-migration.md

Alternatively, if you want to continue using your existing configuration,
install the 'sysutils/snmp_exporter20' port instead, which contains the older
0.20.0 version.

---

In snmp_exporter 0.27.0, breaking changes were made affecting the 'synology',
'ddwrt' and 'kemp_loadmaster' modules.  For migration instructions, see:

    https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter/releases/tag/v0.27.0

---

In snmp_exporter 0.28.0, the sysUpTime metric has been removed from the if_mib
module.  For migration instructions, see:

    https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter/releases/tag/v0.28.0

---

(FreeBSD-specific) Since 0.28.0, the port no longer patches the generator to
hardcode ${PREFIX}/etc in the paths used by snmp_exporter_generator.  If you
were relying on this behaviour, you should update your scripts to specify the
full pathname.
