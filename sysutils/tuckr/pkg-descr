Tuckr is a dotfile manager inspired by Stow and Git. Tuckr aims to make dotfile
management less painful. It follows the same model as Stow, symlinking files
onto $HOME. It works on all the major OSes (Linux, Windows, BSDs and MacOS).

Tuckr aims to bring the simplicity of Stow to a dotfile manager with a very
small learning curve. To achieve that goal Tuckr tries to only cover what is
directly needed to manage dotfiles and nothing else. We won't wrap git, rm, cp
or reimplement the functionality that are perfeclty covered by other utilities
in the system unless it greatly impacts usability.
