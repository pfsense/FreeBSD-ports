The LPRng software is an enhanced, extended, and portable implementation
of the Berkeley LPR print spooler functionality.  While providing the
same interface and meeting RFC1179 requirements, the implementation is
completely different and provides support for the following features:
lightweight (no databases needed) lpr, lpc, and lprm programs; dynamic
redirection of print queues; automatic job holding; highly verbose
diagnostics; multiple printers serving a single queue; client programs
do not need to run SUID root; greatly enhanced security checks; and a
greatly improved permission and authorization mechanism.
