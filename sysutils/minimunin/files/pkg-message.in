To activate minimunin, add the line

    munin stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/libexec/tcpd %%PREFIX%%/bin/minimunin

to your /etc/inetd.conf. Alternatively, if you plan to run plugins that require
root permissions (e.g. for changing to a different user via the plugin config),
add

    munin stream tcp nowait root   /usr/libexec/tcpd %%PREFIX%%/bin/minimunin

to your /etc/inetd.conf. In both cases you need to enable inetd by setting

    inetd_enable="YES"

in your /etc/rc.conf and restart inetd with the

    service inetd start

command. You may also want to restrict access to your munin node via the
/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny configuration files.
