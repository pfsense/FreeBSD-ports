    UNetbootin requires *mounted* MSDOSFS (FAT) filesystem to work against,
    it will not mount your USB memstick or SD card for you!

    If SysLinux refuses to boot with a "Boot error" message when written to
    a PC partition (slice), try to reformat the drive in raw (or dedicated)
    mode (that is, without a partition table), then reinstall things again.
