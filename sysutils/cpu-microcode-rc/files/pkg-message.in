This port includes an RC script, which is one of two methods to update
the CPU microcode on a FreeBSD system.

1. The first method does not require the RC script included here and is
   only supported with Intel processors.  It is the preferred method,
   because it ensures that any CPU features introduced by a microcode
   update are visible to the kernel by applying the update before the
   kernel performs CPU feature detection.

   To enable updates using the first method, add the following lines to
   /boot/loader.conf:

   cpu_microcode_load="YES"
   cpu_microcode_name="/boot/firmware/intel-ucode.bin"

   The microcode update will be loaded when the system is rebooted.


2. The second method, which uses the RC script included here, can be
   enabled by adding the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

   microcode_update_enable="YES"

   The microcode update is then applied upon reboot or when the microcode
   update service is run via:

   # service microcode_update start

   If the CPU requires a microcode update, a console message such as the
   following will appear:

   Updating CPU Microcode...
   %%DATADIR%%/m32306c3_00000022.fw: updating cpu /dev/cpuctl0 from rev 0x17 to rev 0x22... done.
   %%DATADIR%%/m32306c3_00000022.fw: updating cpu /dev/cpuctl2 from rev 0x17 to rev 0x22... done.
   %%DATADIR%%/m32306c3_00000022.fw: updating cpu /dev/cpuctl4 from rev 0x17 to rev 0x22... done.
   %%DATADIR%%/m32306c3_00000022.fw: updating cpu /dev/cpuctl6 from rev 0x17 to rev 0x22... done.
   Done.

It is safe to enable both methods.
