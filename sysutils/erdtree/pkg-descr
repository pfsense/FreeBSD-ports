erdtree is a modern, cross-platform, and multi-threaded filesystem and
disk-usage analysis tool. The following are some feature highlights:

 -  Respects hidden file and gitignore rules by default.
 -  Supports regular expressions and glob based searching by file-type.
 -  Supports Unix-based file permissions (Unix systems only).
 -  Comes with a variety of layouts.
 -  Support icons.
 -  Colorized with LS_COLORS.

You can think of erdtree as a combination of du, tree, find, and ls.
