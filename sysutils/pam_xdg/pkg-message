XDG_RUNTIME_DIR on Wayland maybe used as a fallback for anonymous
shared memory. For better performance and to avoid posix_fallocate(2)
issues on ZFS moving the directory under tmpfs(5) is recommended:

  # echo "none	/var/run/user	tmpfs	rw" >>/etc/fstab
  # mkdir -p /var/run/user
  # mount -a
EOM
}
