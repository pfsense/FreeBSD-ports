SPCM (Simple, Portable Cluster Manager) is a free, open source
integrated tool set for managing a simple HPC (High Performance
Computing) cluster.

It is the only portable cluster management suite we are aware of
and is designed to be easily adapted to most POSIX platforms.

SPCM automates the process of configuring a head node, compute
nodes, file servers, and visualization nodes. Most common management
tasks can be performed using a simple menu interface, while additional
tasks are supported by command-line tools.
