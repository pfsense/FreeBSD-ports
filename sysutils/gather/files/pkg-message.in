To setup statistics gathering you could e.g. add something like this
to /etc/crontab:

  */5 * * * * root %%PREFIX%%/bin/gather collect
  18  0 * * * root %%PREFIX%%/bin/gather expire 7

Before adding this, please, review the configuration in
%%PREFIX%%/etc/gather.

To check that the configuration is correct, run:

  gather show utils
  gather -v collect

After setting cron up, you can check if gathering works running:

  gather show -t 1h grep . uptime

See gather(1) and %%DOCSDIR%%/README for more details.
