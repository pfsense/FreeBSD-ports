The PCI Utilities are a collection of programs for inspecting and manipulating
configuration of PCI devices, all based on a common portable library libpci.

The utilities include:
- lspci: displays detailed information about all PCI buses and devices in the
  system
- setpci: allows reading from and writing to PCI device configuration registers.
  For example, you can adjust the latency timers with it.
