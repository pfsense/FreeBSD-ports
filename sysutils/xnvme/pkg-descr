xNVMe provides the means to program and interact with NMe devices from user
space. The foundation of xNVMe is libxnvme, a user space library for working
with NVMe devices. It provides a C API for memory management, that is, for
allocating physical / DMA transferable memory when needed. xNVMe is an NVMe
command interface allowing you to submit and complete NVMe commands in a
synchronous as well as an asynchronous manner.
