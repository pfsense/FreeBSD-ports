  message: <<EOM
When trying to connect to the default public tmate server it may happpen that
the following errors messages will be printed:

  Connecting to ssh.tmate.io...
  Cannot authenticate server
  Reconnecting... (Cannot authenticate server)

This is because the fingerprints of the default tmate server keys are stripped
out from the tmate binary.

Instead, users are encouraged to specify the fingerprints via ~/.tmate.conf, e.g.:

  set -g tmate-server-rsa-fingerprint   "SHA256:Hthk2T/M/Ivqfk1YYUn5ijC2Att3+UPzD7Rn72P5VWs"
  set -g tmate-server-ecdsa-fingerprint "SHA256:8GmKHYHEJ6n0TEdciHeEGkKOigQfCFuBULdt6vZIhDc"
EOM
