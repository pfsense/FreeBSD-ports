sysctl is a utility on Unix-like operating systems that is used to read and
modify the attributes of the kernel such as its version number, maximum limits,
and security settings.
systeroid is "_sysctl on steroids_". It can do everything that sysctl does and
even more. It provides a safer, more performant, and user-friendly CLI/TUI for
managing the kernel parameters at runtime.
