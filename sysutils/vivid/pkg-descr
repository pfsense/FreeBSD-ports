vivid is a generator for the LS_COLORS environment variable that controls the
colorized output of ls, tree, fd, bfs, dust and many other tools.

It uses a YAML configuration format for the filetype-database and the color
themes. In contrast to dircolors, the database and the themes are organized in
different files. This allows users to choose and customize color themes
independent from the collection of file extensions. Instead of using cryptic
ANSI escape codes, colors can be specified in the RRGGBB format and will be
translated to either truecolor (24-bit) ANSI codes or 8-bit codes for older
terminal emulators.
