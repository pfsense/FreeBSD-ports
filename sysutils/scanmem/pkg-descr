Scanmem is a simple interactive debugging utility for Linux, used to locate
various data in an executing process.  This can be used for the analysis or
modification of a hostile process on a compromised machine, help in reverse
engineering, or to cheat at video games.  Brief list of its features:

  - Interactive command mode, with internal help
  - Efficient and easy-to-use syntax
  - Support for different data types: integers, floats, bytearrays, strings
  - Support for different scan (comparison) types: equal, greater/less than,
    changed, unchanged, increased/decreased
  - Set any variable to any value
  - Detailed information about mappings, allow users to eliminate regions

More in GameConqueror, optional PyGTK-based GUI:

  - User-friendly CheatEngline-alike interface
  - Modify and lock (freeze) variables
  - Memory viewer/editor

It requires linprocfs(5) to be mounted under /compat/linux/proc to operate.
