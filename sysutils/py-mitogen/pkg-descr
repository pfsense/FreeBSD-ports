Python library for writing distributed, self-replicating programs. Its
main feature is a pythonic "remote fork", enabling your program to
bootstrap and communicate with remote copies of itself, requiring only
an existing installed python, and a suitable ssh client.

Mitogen also includes a highly efficient re-implementation of Ansible's
RPC layer, providing a staggering and massive speed-up compared to stock
ansible. Installation is trivial, and the results are impressive.
