mping is a utility for pinging multiple hosts. It is written in shell with
minimal dependencies (awk, date, getconf, head, host, ping, sleep, sort, stty,
tr, uname, and xargs). It also has a feature to keep watching the given hosts
and alert to any changes in availability.

Quickly get status on one or more hosts using ping. Automatically takes
advantage of multiple CPUs and will ping multiple hosts in parallel.

Watch changes in ping status with "-d" for differential mode to alert you when
changes take place.

Use shell expansion features such as 192.168.0.{1..254} to quickly scan for
unused IP addresses (if applicable).
