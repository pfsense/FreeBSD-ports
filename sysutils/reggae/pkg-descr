Reggae - REGister Globaly Access Everywhere is a package which helps in common
DevOps tasks. It is an open source package which relays on CBSD to provide lower
level management for jails and virtual machines.

If you have ever used Vagrant or Docker Compose, Reggae is best described
as an alternative to those. It enables you easy development inside jail
while code editing is done on the host. It makes transition from
development to production easier by using provisioners. It makes host
clean of all requirements of development and puts them inside jail which
is easily stopped, started, provisioned, and destroyed.
