DevedeNG is a program to create video DVDs and CDs (VCD, sVCD or CVD),
suitables for home players, from any number of video files, in any of
the formats supported by Mplayer. The big advantage over other utilites
is that it only needs Mpv, FFMpeg, DVDAuthor, VCDImager and MKisofs
(well, and Python3, PyGTK and PyGlade), so its dependencies are quite
small.
