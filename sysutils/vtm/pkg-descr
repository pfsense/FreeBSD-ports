vtm is a text-based application that represents its user interface
as a mosaic of text cells, forming a TUI matrix. This matrix can be
rendered in its own GUI window or in a compatible text console.
It wraps any console application and supports indefinite nesting,
creating a text-based desktop environment within your terminal.
