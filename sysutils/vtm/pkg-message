Upgrades to vtm 2025.05.28 
==========================

vtm 2025.05.28 contains changes that are made to
configuration settings which are backward-incompatible
for previous versions of vtm. The configuration settings
file has changed significantly due to the introduction
of Pure XML with dynamic element referencing and templating.
