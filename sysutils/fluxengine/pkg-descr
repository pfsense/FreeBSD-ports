The FluxEngine is a very cheap USB floppy disk interface capable of reading
and writing exotic non-PC floppy disk formats.  It allows you to use a
conventional PC drive to accept Amiga disks, CLV Macintosh disks, bizarre
128-sector CP/M disks, and other weird and bizarre formats.

The hardware consists of a single, commodity part with a floppy drive
connector soldered onto it.  No ordering custom boards, no fiddly surface
mount assembly, and no fuss: nineteen simple solder joints and you're done.
