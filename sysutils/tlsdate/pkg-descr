tlsdate sets the local clock by securely connecting with TLS to remote
servers and extracting the remote time out of the secure handshake. Unlike
ntpdate, tlsdate uses TCP, for instance connecting to a remote HTTPS or TLS
enabled service, and provides some protection against adversaries that try to
feed you malicious time information.
