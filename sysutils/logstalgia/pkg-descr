Logstalgia is a website traffic visualization that replays or streams web-server
access logs as a pong-like battle between the web server and an never ending
torrent of requests.

Requests appear as colored balls which travel across the screen to arrive at the
requested location. Successful requests are hit by the paddle while unsuccessful
ones (eg. 404 - File Not Found) are missed and pass through.
