U-Boot loader and related files for the Sopine SPI Flash.

To install this bootloader on the spi flash just do from a running sopine system:
dd if=/usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-sopine-spi/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/flash/spi0 bs=64k conv=sync

U-boot environment variables are save in the flash and not in the fat partition.

You can also use the flasher image
dd if=/usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-sopine-spi/sopine-spi-flasher.img of=/path/to/sdcard
Boot the sdcard on the sopine/pine64-lts and it will erase and populate the spi flash
with this u-boot.
Since there is no led that we can flash do indicate that flashing is done the best way to
know it to connect an uart adapter or hdmi monitor.
