RealtimeKit is a D-Bus system service that changes the scheduling policy of user
processes/threads to the realtime scheduling mode on request. It is intended to
be used as a secure mechanism to allow real-time scheduling to be used by
unprivileged user processes.

rtkit-unix is a BSD licensed C++ implementation of the RealtimeKit's interface
aimed at running on non-Linux OSes.
