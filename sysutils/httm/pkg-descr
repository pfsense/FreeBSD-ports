The dream of a CLI Time Machine is still alive with httm.

httm prints the size, date and corresponding locations of available unique
versions (deduplicated by modify time and size) of files residing on snapshots,
but can also be used interactively to select and restore such files. httm might
change the way you use snapshots (because ZFS/btrfs aren't designed for finding
for unique file versions) or the Time Machine concept (because httm is very
fast!).
