Sample files and scripts are installed in %%ETCDIR%%.
You need to modify %%ETCDIR%%/apcupsd.conf as follows:

  For serial cable: DEVICE /dev/cuadX (or /dev/cuaaX for [45.]x)
  For USB cable: DEVICE (yes, leave it blank after DEVICE)
  NOTE that for USB cable you need uhid support.

Add apcupsd_enable=YES to your /etc/rc.conf[.local] to have apcupsd
starting up at boot time.

For default, apcupsd starts with `--kill-on-powerfail` parameter.
Please, read its man page, and if this is not the intended behavior you want,
change it accordingly.

If connected via USB and apcaccess reports incomplete data consider enabling
the USB_REPORTING options via 'make config'.  This contains an experimental
patch that may fix some USB attach APC UPS. PR #249041

In some systems where the shutdown can take a while (like in bhyve environment),
you may want to change this behavior as follows:

Set apcupsd_flags="--term-on-powerfail" on your /etc/rc.conf[.local].

Add this to /etc/rc.shutdown, after the "Insert other shutdown procedures here"
line:
  test -f /var/run/powerfail && /usr/local/sbin/apcupsd --hibernate
  or
  test -f /var/run/powerfail && /usr/local/sbin/apcupsd --power-off
