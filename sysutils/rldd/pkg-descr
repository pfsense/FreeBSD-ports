The rldd tool resolves and prints the binary or shared library
dependencies with different visualization options. In opposite to the
Linux ldd tool, it does not invoke the system loader but instead
parses the loading information directly from either ELF or Mach-O
files, along with any required system files (such as loader cache or
extra configuration files).
