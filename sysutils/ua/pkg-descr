ua is a simple command-line tool that finds sets of identical files.
The name ua is derived from the Hungarian word ugyanaz meaning the same.

The development of ua was motivated by the disturbingly often recurring
event of waiting too long for a shell script using sorts, md5sums, diffs
and the like to finish finding identical files. While there are many tools
out there, we needed a tool that can ignore white spaces and runs quite fast.
