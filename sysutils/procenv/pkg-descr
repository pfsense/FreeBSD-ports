procenv is a simple command-line utility, written in C and licensed under the
GPL, that dumps all attributes of the environment in which it runs, in
well-structured plain ASCII, JSON (YAML), XML or CSV.

It is useful as a test tool, to understand what environment a process runs in
and for system comparison.
