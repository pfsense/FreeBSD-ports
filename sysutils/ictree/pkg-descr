ictree is a terminal-based program that takes a list of contents of directories
and displays them in a pager similar to less where you can fold/unfold
directories and quickly jump between them.

EXAMPLES:

Find something with locate and pipe output into ictree:

    locate something | ictree

The same applies to any program that can produce a list of paths. For example,
one can use find with ictree to view current working directory in a nice
tree-like format:

    find | ictree

ictree can also take a file that contains paths as its first argument:

    locate something > list.txt
    ictree list.txt

ictree supports Vi-like search functionality. Extended regular expressions are
supported. If a pattern contains '/' character, the search is performed by full
paths of items instead of their short names in the list.
