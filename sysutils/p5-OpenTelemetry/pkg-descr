The OpenTelemetry distribution is the Perl implementation of OpenTelemetry.
This module provides an entrypoint and exposes exposes an interface to get
and set components that need to be globally available.

The OpenTelemetry standard keeps a strict separation between an API layer
that implements an interface that is backend-agnostic, and an SDK layer
that can be connected to the API to do the actual work.

$logger_provider = OpenTelemetry->logger_provider;
OpenTelemetry->logger_provider = $new_logger_provider;
