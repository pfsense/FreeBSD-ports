dc3dd is a patched version of GNU dd to include a number of features useful
for computer forensics. Many of these features were inspired by dcfldd, but
were rewritten for dc3dd.

- Pattern writes. The program can write a single hexadecimal value or a text
  string to the output device for wiping purposes.
- Piecewise and overall hashing with multiple algorithms. Supports MD5, SHA-1,
  SHA-256, and SHA-512.
- Progress meter with automatic input/output file size probing.
- Combined log for hashes and errors.
- Error grouping. Produces one error message for identical sequential errors.
- Verify mode. Able to hash output files and compare hashes to the acquisition
  hash.
- Ability to split the output into chunks with numerical or alphabetic
  extensions.
- Ability to write multiple output files simultaneuously.
