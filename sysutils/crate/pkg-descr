crate is a FreeBSD containerizer utilizing FreeBSD jails.

crate can create the application container based on the description provided by
the user, and then runs this container any number of times as a monolithic
process, with all dependencies included in the container.

Containers can be useful in these scenarios:
* You can keep any version of your application, and it will always run later the
  same way, regardless of what packages will be installed on your system.
* You can run a web browser from the crate container, and every time it will run
  in the clean environment not allowing any tracking.
* You can run closed source applications, they will be isolated from the rest of
  your system, and there will be no chance for them seeing your disks.

crate is in its alpha stage. Things might not work as expected!
