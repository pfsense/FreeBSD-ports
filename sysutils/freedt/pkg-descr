freedt is a service supervision framework for POSIX operating
systems. Most of the tools are independent reimplementations of Dan
Bernstein's daemontools.

It currently includes feature-equivalent replacements for argv0,
envdir, envuidgid, setlock, setuidgid, softlimit, supervise, svc,
svok, svscan, svstat and recordio. It also includes anonidentd (an
dummy identd implementation), dumblog (a simple multilog replacement),
mkservice (a tool to create service directories), and ratelimit (a
bandwidth-limiting filter along the lines of recordio).
