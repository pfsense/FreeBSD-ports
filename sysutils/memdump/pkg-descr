This program dumps system memory to the standard output stream, skipping
over holes in memory maps.  By default, the program dumps the contents of
physical memory.

Note: consider using Brian Carrier's Sleuthkit, available as `sysutils/
sleuthkit' port.  It is the official successor, based on parts from TCT.
Development of the Coroner's Toolkit was stopped years ago.  It is only
updated for bugfixes, which are very rare.
