mult is a command-line tool that runs shell commands multiple times and
provides a terminal user interface (TUI) for comparing the outputs.

Features:

- Run commands multiple times concurrently or sequentially
- Specify number of runs
- Add delay between runs
- Stop at first failure
- Compare outputs via TUI

Useful for investigating inconsistent web server responses, checking flaky
test suite outcomes, and running performance/stress tests.
