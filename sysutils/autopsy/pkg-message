Default autopsy configuration file is /usr/local/lib/autopsy/conf.pl



The NIST National Software Reference Library (NSRL) contains
hash values of known good and bad files.
   http://www.nsrl.nist.gov

If you have a copy of the NSRL, you may add support in Autopsy by
adding the path to the NSRLFile.txt to the "NSRLDB" configuration
entry:
   NSRLDB = /path/to/NSRLFile.txt

The index file NSRLFile.txt-md5.idx must be in the same directory.
If it does not exist it may be created with the TSK hfind command:
   hfind -i nsrl-md5 /path/to/NSRLFile.txt



Autopsy saves configuration files, audit logs, and output to the
Evidence Locker directory. You MUST specify this with the LOCKDIR
configuration entry before running Autopsy:
   LOCKDIR = /path/to/locker



WARNING: The cross-platform version of Autopsy is no longer actively
         developed. This port is retained mainly to allow users with
         saved data to migrate to another forensic tool.
