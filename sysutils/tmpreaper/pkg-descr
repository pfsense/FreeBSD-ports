This port provides a program that can be used to clean out temporary-file
directories. It recursively searches the directory, refusing to chdir()
across symlinks, and removes files that have not been accessed in a
user-specified amount of time. You can specify a set of files to protect
from deletion with a shell pattern.

It will not remove symlinks, sockets, fifos, or special files unless given a
command line option enabling it to.
