Istio is an open platform for providing a uniform way to integrate
microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce
policies and aggregate telemetry data. Istio's control plane provides
an abstraction layer over the underlying cluster management platform,
such as Kubernetes, Mesos, etc.
