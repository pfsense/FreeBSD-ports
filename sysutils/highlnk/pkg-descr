HighLnk is a high-performance hardlinking tool, which takes the contents of the
current directory, and hard-links files with different content to the target
directory. Files with same content will also be hard-linked but in a way that
storage space is saved. This is useful if you have many files on a read-only
partition, or if you plan to put many files on a CD/DVD, but the whole tree is
just too big to fit on the media.
