  message: <<EOM

Sample files and scripts are installed in %%ETCDIR%%.

Some examples of devices:
 /dev/ttyU0    /dev/ttyUSB.nobreak
 /dev/ttyUSB0  /dev/ttyUSB1  /dev/ttyUSB2
 /dev/ttyACM0  /dev/ttyACM1  /dev/ttyACM2

Add apcctrl_enable=YES to your /etc/rc.conf[.local] to have apcctrl
starting up at boot time.

For default, apcctrl starts with `--kill-on-powerfail` parameter.
Please, read its man page, and if this is not the intended behavior you want,
change it accordingly.

In some systems where the shutdown can take a while (like in bhyve environment),
you may want to change this behavior as follows:

Set apcctrl_flags="--term-on-powerfail" on your /etc/rc.conf[.local].

Add this to /etc/rc.shutdown, after the "Insert other shutdown procedures here"
line:
  test -f /var/run/powerfail && /usr/local/sbin/apcctrl --hibernate
  or
  test -f /var/run/powerfail && /usr/local/sbin/apcctrl --power-off
