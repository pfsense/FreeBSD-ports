Important changes in logwatch-7.13:

 - temporary data is now stored in /var/cache/logwatch
   (you can remove /usr/local/var/logwatch, now)

 - ability to deal with FBSD's <facility.severity> patterns in logfiles, if activated

 - improvement of the dovecot script and conf files 
   (allow granular detail options like the ones for postfix script)

 - postfix script detects modified 3.10+ log entries, now
