s-tui is a terminal UI for monitoring the computer. s-tui allows to monitor:

- CPU temperature/utilization/frequency/power
- performance dips caused by thermal throttling

s-tui requires minimal resources and no X-server. There are also built in
options for stressing the CPU (support for stress/stress-ng).
