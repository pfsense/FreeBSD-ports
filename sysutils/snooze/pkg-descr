Snooze waits until a particular time and then runs a command.
Together with a service supervision system such as runsv(8) (from
sysutils/runit), this can be used to replace cron(8).

Benefits over cron(8):

- mnemonic syntax
- no overlapping job runs possible
- filtering by ISO week and day of year
- no centralized daemon required (no fuzzing with multiple
  users/permissions)    
- can easily disable jobs or force their execution
  instantly
- have custom logs
- very robust with respect to external time changes
- can use a file timestamp to ensure minimum waiting time between two
  runs, even across reboots
- randomized delays
- variable slack
- ad-hoc usage possible, just run the program from command line
