Lazyssh is a terminal-based, interactive SSH manager built for managing your
fleet of servers directly from your terminal. With lazyssh, you can quickly
navigate, connect, manage, and transfer files between your local machine and
any server defined in your ssh config. No more remembering IP addresses or
running long scp commands -- just a clean, keyboard-driven UI.
