A flexible backup tool

Features:
   o Easy to configure
   o Uses dump, afio, GNU tar, cpio, pax, or zip archivers
   o Full and numbered levels of incremental backup (acts like "dump")
   o Compression and buffering options for all backup types
   o Does remote filesystems (over rsh/ssh; no special service)
   o Can backup only files not owned by rpm, or changed from rpm version
   o Writes to tapes, on-disk archive files, or on-disk directory trees
   o Keeps a table of contents so you know archives are on each tape
   o Nice log files
