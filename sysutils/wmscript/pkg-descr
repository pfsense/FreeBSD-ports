WMScript is a system monitoring dock app for Window Maker.
It allows you to specify a command and have the numeric result of that command
displayed in the dock app's window. You may specify up to 5 things to monitor
and the interval is configurable.
This combines to make it a very flexible tool for system monitoring.
It is based on WMiNet, and the look is the same.
