  message: <<EOM
The nomad rc script requires the nomad data directory (as configured
in the rc variable `nomad_dir`) to use strict directory permissions.

If your nomad data directory was created automatically using a
previous version of the package, it is likely that its permissions
are too lax. If that is the case, nomad will refuse to start with
an error message and the situation can be resolved by adjusting
directory permissions manually by issuing the chmod command,
e.g. `chmod 700 /var/tmp/nomad`.
