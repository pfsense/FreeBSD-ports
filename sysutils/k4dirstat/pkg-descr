KDirStat (for KDE Directory Statistics) is a small utility program that
sums up disk usage for directory trees. Its functionality is similar to
the Unix du command, but it provides more helpful diagnostic
information. KDirStat also features some built-in cleanup facilities and
the ability to include your own cleanup commands or scripts.
