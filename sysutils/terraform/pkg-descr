Terraform provides a common configuration to launch infrastructure - from
physical and virtual servers to email and DNS providers. Once launched,
Terraform safely and efficiently changes infrastructure as the configuration is
evolved. Simple file based configuration gives you a single view of your entire
infrastructure.
