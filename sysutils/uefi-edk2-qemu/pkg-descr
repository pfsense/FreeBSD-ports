Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) compliant firmware can be
developed using the EFI Development Kit II (EDK2).

UEFI provides a specification for modern system (boot) firmware for x86,
x86_64, arm and arm64 machines. This system firmware was previously
called a 'BIOS'.

This package contains the Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF) package
from the TianoCore EDK II project configured to run under QEMU.
