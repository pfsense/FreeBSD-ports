awslim is a CLI utility for AWS services.  This is written in Go and
generated from the AWS SDK Go v2 service client.  Features include:

 - Improved performance compared to AWS CLI,
 - All methods of the AWS service client,
 - JSON and Jsonnet as input format,
 - JSON as output format (no support of TEXT),
 - Binding of a file to the input/output data structure of methods,
 - JMESPath to query the output,
 - AWS CLI configuration file (~/.aws/config) and the native
   configuration files (~/.config/awslim/config.(json|jsonnet|yaml|yml)).

Note the following limitations, compared to AWS CLI:
 - Not fully-compatible with the AWS CLI,
 - No support of AWS CLI plugins, such as session-manager-plugin,
 - Different service names, "logs" vs "cloudwatchlogs,"
   "ce" vs "costexplorer," for example.
