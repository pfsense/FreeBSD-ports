Flipperbit generates multiple corrupted variants of an input file by
randomly flipping bits in selected byte ranges.

Flipperbit allows to specify multiple byte ranges and the bit flipping
probabilty.

The output of flipperbit can be used as input to software (E.g., bulk file
processing applications, file parsing utilities) as a form of dumb fuzzing.
