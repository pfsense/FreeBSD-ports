bulk_extractor is a C++ program that scans a disk image, a file,
or a directory of files and extracts useful information without
parsing the file system or file system structures. The results are
stored in feature files that can be easily inspected, parsed, or
processed with automated tools. bulk_extractor also creates
histograms of features that it finds, as features that are more
common tend to be more important.
