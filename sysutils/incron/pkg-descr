This program is an "inotify cron" system. It consists of a daemon
and a table manipulator. You can use it a similar way as the regular
cron. The difference is that the inotify cron handles filesystem
events rather than time periods.

Written to use (and named after) Linux' "inotify", on BSD it uses
the libinotify compatibility layer.
