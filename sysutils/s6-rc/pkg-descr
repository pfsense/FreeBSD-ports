s6-rc is a service manager for s6-based systems, i.e. a suite of programs
that can start and stop services, both long-running daemons and one-time
initialization scripts, in the proper order according to a dependency tree.

It ensures that long-running daemons are supervised by the s6 infrastructure,
and that one-time scripts are also run in a controlled environment.
