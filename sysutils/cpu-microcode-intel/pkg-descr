This port uses the cpuctl(4) microcode update facility to keep your Intel
processor's firmware up-to-date.

Updating your microcode can help to mitigate certain potential security
vulnerabilities in CPUs as well as address certain functional issues that could,
for example, result in unpredictable system behavior such as hangs, crashes,
unexpected reboots, data errors, etc.
