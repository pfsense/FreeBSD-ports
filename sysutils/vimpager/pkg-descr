Vimpager uses the power of Vim to provide a powerful pager.
It runs Vim (or NeoVim, or even GVim) and acts as a frontend,
allowing for full Vim syntax highlighting, navigation, and
configurability.

To make Vimpager look for anything other than `vim', set
VIMPAGER_VIM=nvim or VIMPAGER_VIM=gvim.

To set Vimpager as your default pager, export PAGER=vimpager
in your shell.
