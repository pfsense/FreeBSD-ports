Compare version strings:

This function compares strings S1 and S2:

    By PREFIX in the same way as strcmp.

    Then by VERSION (most similarly to version compare of Debian's dpkg).
    Leading zeros in version numbers are ignored.

    If both (PREFIX and VERSION) are equal, strcmp function is used for
    comparison. So this function can return 0 if (and only if) strings S1 and
    S2 are identical.

It returns number >0 for S1 > S2, 0 for S1 == S2 and number <0 for S1 < S2.
