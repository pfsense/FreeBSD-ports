Clone of the David Carpenter's "Everything" search engine, which locates
files and folders by their name instantly, for Unix-like systems.

This simple file search crawls available disks creating a database that
can be searched using quick and responsive graphical interface.
Notable difference is that by default, the entire paths are searched,
not just file and folder names.
