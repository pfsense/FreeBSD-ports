Borgmatic is a simple Python wrapper script for the Borg backup software that
initiates a backup, prunes any old backups according to a retention policy,
and validates backups for consistency.

The script supports specifying your settings in a declarative configuration
file rather than having to put them all on the command-line, and handles common
errors.
