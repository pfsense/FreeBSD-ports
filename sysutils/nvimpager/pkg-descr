Using neovim as a pager to view man pages, git diffs, whatnot with neovim's
syntax highlighting and mouse support.

The script also has a "cat mode" which will not start up the neovim interface
but instead print a highlighted version of the file to the terminal. Like cat
with neovim syntax highlighting! If the input has less lines than the terminal
cat mode is activated automatically so nvimpager behaves similar to less -F.
Pager mode and cat mode can be enforced with the options -p and -c
respectively.

Nvimpager comes with a small set of command line options but you can also use
all of neovim's command line options. Use nvimpager -h to see the help text.
The configuration is separated from the users config for neovim. The main
config file is ~/.config/nvimpager/init.vim. See the manpage for further
explanation.
