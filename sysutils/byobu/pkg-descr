Byobu is a GPLv3 open source text-based window manager and terminal
multiplexer. It was originally designed to provide elegant enhancements
to the otherwise functional, plain, practical GNU Screen. Byobu now
includes an enhanced profiles, convenient keybindings, configuration
utilities, and toggle-able system status notifications for both the GNU
Screen window manager and the more modern Tmux terminal multiplexer.
The Python newt library is only needed if you wish to use the menu-
based config editor.
