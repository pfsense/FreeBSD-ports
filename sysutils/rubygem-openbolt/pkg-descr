OpenBolt is an open source orchestration tool that automates the manual work it
takes to maintain your infrastructure. Use OpenBolt to automate tasks that you
perform on an as-needed basis or as part of a greater orchestration workflow.
For example, you can use OpenBolt to patch and update systems, troubleshoot
servers, deploy applications, or stop and restart services. OpenBolt can be
installed on your local workstation and connects directly to remote targets
with SSH or WinRM, so you are not required to install any agent software.

OpenBolt is a community implementation of Puppet Bolt.
