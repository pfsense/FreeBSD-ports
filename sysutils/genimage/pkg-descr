genimage is a tool to generate multiple filesystem and flash/disk images
from a given root filesystem tree. genimage is intended to be run in a
fakeroot environment. It also supports creating flash/disk images out of
different file-system images and files.

Configuration is done in a config file parsed by libconfuse. Options like the
path to tools can be given via environment variables, the config file or from
commandline switches.
