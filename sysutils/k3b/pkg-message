1. The FreeBSD k3b port supports SCSI drives only. If you have IDE CD or DVD
   drives, use them through the cam system. See Chapter 17.5.1 of the handbook
   (http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/creating-cds.html)
2. k3b has to be started from a root console, which is not recommended.
   Alternatively, do ALL of the following:
   a. Every user must have read and write access to /dev/cdX:
      - add to your /etc/devfs.rules under '[system=10]':
          add path 'cd*' mode 666
      - or if you prefer allow access for a group XXX only add instead:
          add path 'cd*' mode 660 group XXX
      - to enable it, add to your /etc/rc.conf
          # sysrc devfs_system_ruleset="system"
   b. Every user who should be able to use k3b must have read and write access
      to all pass through devices connected with CD and DVD drives and to the
      /dev/xpt0 device. Run 'camcontrol devlist' to identify those devices (seek
      string 'passX' at the end of each line). Note, that this is a security
      leak as well but that there is no alternative!
      - add to your /etc/devfs.rules under '[system=10]':
          add path 'pass*' mode 666
          add path 'xpt0' mode 666
      - or if you prefer allow access for a group XXX only add instead:
          add path 'pass*' mode 660 group XXX
          add path 'xpt0' mode 660 group XXX
      - to enable it, add to your /etc/rc.conf
          # sysrc devfs_system_ruleset="system"
      - to apply these changes without reboot, run as root:
          # service devfs restart
3. Create a directory on a partition, which has enough disk space to hold a CDs
   or DVDs content (usually below /usr). Enter this directory in Settings->
   Configure K3b...->Misc.
4. You must configure devel/kf5-solid appropriately:
   a. Either use the (default) HAL backend, and enable HAL in /etc/rc.conf via
      # sysrc hald_enable="YES"
   b. *or* use the (experimental) BSDISKS backend.
5. Last but not the least, you need to set cdrecord parameters in K3b's
   "Settings --> Configure k3b... --> Programs --> User Parameters" to
   match your device as seen by `cdrecord -scanbus' (e.g. dev=3,0,0)
