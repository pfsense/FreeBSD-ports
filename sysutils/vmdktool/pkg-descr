vmdktool converts raw filesystems to VMDK files and vice versa.

VMDK files can be imported directly into most Virtual Machine servers
as guest filesystems.  Automatic machine deployments into products
such as VMware's ESXi and VirtualBox requires the ability to construct
VMDK files as the initial filesystem images for the created guests.

vmdktool is free.
