OpenTofu is an OSS tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure
safely and efficiently. OpenTofu can manage existing and popular service
providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of OpenTofu are:

Infrastructure as Code: Infrastructure is described using a high-level
configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be
versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure
can be shared and re-used.

Execution Plans: OpenTofu has a "planning" step where it generates an execution
plan. The execution plan shows what OpenTofu will do when you call apply. This
lets you avoid any surprises when OpenTofu manipulates infrastructure.

Resource Graph: OpenTofu builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes
the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this,
OpenTofu builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get
insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

Change Automation: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure
with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan
and resource graph, you know exactly what OpenTofu will change and in what
order, avoiding many possible human errors.
