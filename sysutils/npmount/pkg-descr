NPMount is a command-line tool to provide limited mount and unmount
capabilities to non-privileged users, such as mounting and unmounting
external media including optical discs and thumb drives.  It is
primarily intended to be a companion tool for automount services
such as FreeBSD's devd, NetBSD's devpubd, etc. and client tools such
as qmediamanager.
