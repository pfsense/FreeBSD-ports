**Breaking changes since 0.14.20250420**

The `rcorder` has been deprecated, and new `boot` and `priority` options have
been added to the jails. A boot file will be created with default values of
`boot=on` and `priority=99` on jail creation. For existing jails, the boot file
will be generated on the next subcommand execution to the jail. If you want to
generate the file for all the jails, you can use `bastille restart ALL` to fill
in the defaults. To change these values, use `bastille config TARGET set boot off`
or `bastille config TARGET set priority 10` or some other number according to
your needs.

  message: <<EOM
**Notice: Potencially breaking changes since 1.0.20250714**

Network: Bastille now handles all epairs dynamically, allowing both -V and -B
VNET jails to coexist. Previous versions only supported one type per system.
New naming scheme for network interfaces is e0a_jailname (host side) and
e0b_jailname (jail side). Additional interfaces: e1a_jailname, e1b_jailname, etc
(incrementing numbers). Long jail names are truncated with xx placeholder due to
interface name limitations

Required action after update:

Restart all jails (preferably one at a time) to trigger automatic conversion.
Bastille will auto-convert jail.conf and rc.conf files when jails are stopped.
Manual intervention required: If you previously used the network sub-command to
add interfaces, manually edit jail.conf and rc.conf files to update epair names
(increment numbers for additional interfaces).

Auto-conversion handles most cases, please report bugs if issues occur during the
transition.
