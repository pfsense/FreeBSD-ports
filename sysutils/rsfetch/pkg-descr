Fast (<1ms execution time) system information
fetching program, written entirely in Rust. It
currently supports Linux and (Open|Net|Free)BSD.
All information fields are disabled by default,
and must be manually enabled via configuration
flags.

rsfetch has no configuration file, making it even
more fast. Users may instead create aliases in their
~/.${SHELL}rc. In addition, no automatic package
manager or ASCII logo mechanism is present, but must
instead be manually specified.
