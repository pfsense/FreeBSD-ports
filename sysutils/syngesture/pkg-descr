syngestures is a utility providing multi-gesture support for various Linux
touchpad/trackpad drivers implementing the Linux Multi-Touch Protocol, such as
xf86-input-synaptics.

syngestures is a daemon (background application) that listens for input events
generated by your touchpad or trackpad and detects when multi-touch gestures are
performed. It can be configured (globally or on a per-user level) to carry out
user-defined actions when specific gestures are recognized (with support for
unique configurations per-device if you have multiple touchpads installed).

It may be used alone or, more commonly, in conjunction with desktop
environment/display server integration/driver - we recommend using it with
xf86-input-synaptics` under X11 for the most responsive and "natural" cursor
movement and acceleration.
