bhyvemgr was installed

1) bhyvemgr config file is located at ~/.config/bhyvemgr

2) Log messages are saved to ~/.config/bhyvemgr/bhyvemgr.log file

3) It can be compiled with supports for gtk2, qt5 or qt6 graphic interfaces

4) Now, bhyvemgr supports the use of cloud and VM images. You can even use cloud
   init or nuageinit to initialize them.

5) If you use a minimal configuration, it uses templates files inside of
   %%DATADIR%%/templates directory. Do not remove wildcard inside of these
   files. Use samples files if you want define your own configuration.

6) If you want to use your own configuration files: user-data and meta-data, try
   to keep %%UUID%% and %%HOSTAME%% inside of them as you can look at
   %%DATADIR%%/samples directory. Also, you can keep %%MACADDRESS%%, %%GATEWAY4%%,
   %%IP4ADDRESS%%, and %%DNS4SERVERS%% wildcards inside of network-config file.

   They will be replaced with virtual machine values depending on of the selected
   options.

7) For an optimal use of bhyvemgr, some settings must be applied to your system.
   Take a look at the following url:
