scanbd is daemon that listens for scanner button presses and can run scripts.

From the project page:

scanbd is a scanner button daemon. It polls the scanner buttons
looking for buttons pressed or function knob changes or other scanner
events as paper inserts / removals and at the same time allows also
scan-applications to access the scanners. If buttons are pressed,
etc., various actions can be submitted (scan, copy, email, ...) via
action scripts. The function knob values are passed to the
action-scripts as well. Scan actions are also signaled via dbus. This
can be useful for foreign applications. Scans can also be triggered
via dbus from foreign applications. On platforms which support
signaling of dynamic device insertion / removal (libudev, dbus, hal)
scanbd supports this as well. scanbd can use all sane-backends or some
special backends from the (old) scanbuttond project. Supported
platforms: Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
