A user-space utility for testing the memory subsystem for faults.  It is
portable and should compile and work on any 32- or 64-bit Unix-like system.
(Yes, even weird, proprietary Unices, and even Mac OS X.)  For hardware
developers, memtester can be told to test memory starting at a particular
physical address as of memtester version 4.1.0.

The original source was by Simon Kirby <sim@stormix.com>.  The program has
been rewritten by Charles Cazabon and many additional tests were added to
help catch borderline memory.  He also rewrote the original tests (which
catch mainly memory bits which are stuck permanently high or low) so that
they run approximately an order of magnitude faster.
