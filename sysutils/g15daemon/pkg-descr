G15daemon takes control of the G15 keyboard, allowing the use of all keys
through the uinput device driver. It also controls the use of the
keyboard's LCD display, allows multiple, simultaneous client applications
to connect, and gives the user the ability to switch between client apps
at the press of a button.
