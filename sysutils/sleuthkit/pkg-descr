The Sleuth Kit (TSK) is a library and collection of command line tools that
allow you to investigate volume and file system data.  The library can be
incorporated into larger digital forensics tools and the command line tools
can be directly used to find evidence.

The media management tools allow you to examine the layout of disks and
other media.  The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk
labels), Mac partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT
disks.  With these tools, you can identify where partitions are located and
extract them so that they can be analyzed with file system analysis tools.
