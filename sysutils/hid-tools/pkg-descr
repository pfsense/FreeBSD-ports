hid-tools is a set of tools to interact with the kernel's HID subsystem.

hid-recorder prints the HID Report Descriptor from a /dev/hidraw device
node and any HID reports coming from that device.  The output format can
be used with hid-replay for debugging.

hid-replay takes the output from hid-recorder and replays it through a
virtual HID device that looks exactly like the one recorded.

hid-decode takes a HID Report Descriptor and prints a human-readable
version of it.  hid-decode takes binary report descriptors, strings of
bytes, and other formats.

hid-tools requires hidraw.ko driver to be loaded in to kernel.
