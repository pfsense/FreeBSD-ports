The configuration file can be found at the following path:
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/overlord.yml
Edit it to suit your needs before starting the Overlord services.

1. If you have configured Overlord to use Beanstalkd and Memcache locally (by default),
   you need to start those services.

   - enable required services:
     # sysrc beanstalkd_enable=YES
     # sysrc memcached_enable=YES

   - start required services:
     # service beanstalkd start
     # service memcached start

2. If you have not installed Director or AppJail from the development repository and
   prefer to install them from precompiled binaries:

   - install Director:
     # pkg install %%PYTHON_PKGNAMEPREFIX%%director

   - install AppJail:
     # pkg install -y appjail # or appjail-devel

3. Set up supervisord in order to execute Overlord services:
  - Some processes may rely on the assumption that rctl(4) is enabled, if it is not
    already enabled, please enable it by adding to /boot/loader.conf:
kern.racct.enable=1

    Remember to reboot for the above change take effect.

  - let supervisord.conf load files contained in this directory by adding to
    %%PREFIX%%/etc/supervisord.conf:
[include]
files = %%DATADIR%%/overlord.ini

  - enable supervisord:
    # sysrc supervisord_enable=YES

  - start supervisord:
    # service supervisord start

4. Enjoy.
EOM
