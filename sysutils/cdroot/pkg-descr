This port automates the creation of a bootable CD-ROM which contains a
full FreeBSD installation. It also includes a script for installing a
FreeBSD release, as built by 'make release'. If desired, a floppy disk
with an /etc directory may be provided to supply system /etc overrides,
allowing one to use the same CD/DVD image to boot multiple systems, where
each system's hostname, IP address, etc is contained on a separate floppy
disk. See the README file for more information.
