Daemon to prevent hard disk head parking in rotational media.  The daemon
will issue small read requests periodically to a random location on disk
in an effort to reset the inactivity timer in the hardware and so prevent
the dreaded head unloading.  As such, its operation is non-destructive and
interoperable across different brands of hard drives.
