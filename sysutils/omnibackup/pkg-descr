OmniBackup is a MIT-licensed, feature rich, pure Bash script which assists you
in taking periocdic backups from OpenLDAP, PostgreSQL, MariaDB / MySQL and your
filesystem. It also lets you extend OmniBackup by creating custom backup
scenarios and defining your own customized scripts.

Configuration in OmniBackup is done through JSON. It also provides plenty of
compression and cryptography algorithms such as LZMA2, gzip and bzip2
compression algorithms, and AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256 symmetric cryptography
algorithms. Furthermore, it has support for RSA signatures to verify the backup
origin and integrity on remote servers. MD4, MD5, MDC-2, RIPEMD160, SHA, SHA-1,
SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 and WHIRLPOOL are supported as backup
integrity hash algorithms.

It supports multiple backup servers and as many as reports recipients through
email. It has the optional ability to follow symbolic links or to preserve
permissions inside backup files. And, last but not least it provides random
passphrase generation for encrypted archives with variable length and patterns
or a unique passphrase for all backups. It's also possible to encrypt each
passphrase by using RSA public keys for individual backup servers.
