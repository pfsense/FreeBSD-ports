In order to run OmniBackup, you will need to create and configure the main
configuration file, e.g.:

$ cp -p %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/omnibackup/config.json.sample \
      %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/omnibackup/config.json

or, create it in the root users' home directory:

$ cp -p %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/omnibackup/config.json.sample \
      %%ROOT_HOME%%/.omnibackup/config.json

In order to take automatic backups every 24 hours at 01:00am UTC run this
command:

$ crontab -e -u root

Then add the following lines to the root users' crontab:

# OmniBackup daily backups
00      01      *       *       *       %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/omnibackup

To avoid data loss, make sure to consult the documentation at:

* %%LOCALBASE%%/share/doc/omnibackup/README.md
or
* https://github.com/NuLL3rr0r/omnibackup

Before you use it in production.
