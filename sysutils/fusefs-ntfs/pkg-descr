The ntfs-3g driver is an open source, freely available read/write NTFS
driver, which provides safe and fast handling of the Windows XP, Windows
Server 2003, Windows 2000, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7
and Windows 8 NTFS file systems. Almost the full POSIX filesystem
functionality is supported, the major exceptions are changing the file
ownerships and the access rights.
