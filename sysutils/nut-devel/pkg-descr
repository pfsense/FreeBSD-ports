This is a developing project to monitor a large assortment of UPS hardware.
Network communications are used so that multiple systems can monitor a
single physical UPS and shut down together if necessary without any
special "sharing hardware" on the UPS itself. CGI scripts are provided
to monitor UPS status via a WEB browser.
