This is a port of hourglass, a synthetic real-time application that
can be used to learn how CPU scheduling in a general-purpose operating
system works at microsecond and millisecond granularities.

- It creates very detailed map of when each Hourglass thread has
  access to the CPU

- It supports multiple thread execution models; e.g. periodic and
  CPU-bound

- It acts as an abstraction layer for threading, timing, and CPU
  scheduling functionality on Unix- and Win32-based systems
