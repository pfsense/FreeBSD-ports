This is a port of am-utils, The Berkeley Automounter Suite of Utilities

The Berkeley Automounter, Amd, may be used as a replacement for Sun's
automounter.

An automounter maintains a cache of mounted file systems. File systems
are mounted on demand when they are first referenced, and unmounted
after a period of inactivity. This helps to centralize all file system
access, provide a uniform site-wide namespace, and minimize downtimes
for clients.
