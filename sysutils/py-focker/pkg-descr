Focker is a FreeBSD image orchestration tool in the vein of Docker.

It provides powerful containerization primitives (images, volumes and
containers) first introduced by the Docker platform without taking up
the significantly more challenging task of achieving Docker
compatibility.

Supports:

 * Image creation
 * Jail creation
 * Storage volumes
 * Container composition
