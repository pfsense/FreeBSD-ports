This program will attempt to obtain some system information by accessing files
in linprocfs. You must mount linprocfs filesystem for this to work correctly.
This can be accomplished by adding the following line to your /etc/fstab file:

# Device                Mountpoint              FStype          Options Dump Pass
linprocfs               /compat/linux/proc      linprocfs       rw      0       0

and then, as root, executing the command:

mount linprocfs
EOM
}
]
