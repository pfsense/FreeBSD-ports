Unieject is a drop-in replacement for usual eject command, which works
on Linux and FreeBSD. It has more functionalities than FreeBSD's eject
command, and it's partially compatible with Linux's one.

It also features a library to access functions to lookup devices and
mountpoints, unmount and eject devices.
