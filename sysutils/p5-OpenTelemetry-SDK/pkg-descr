This distribution provides the reference implementation of the OpenTelemetry
Perl interfaces currently defined in the experimental OpenTelemetry
distribution. That is, it includes the functionality needed to collect,
analyze, and export telemetry data produced using the API.

Generally, Perl applications should install this distribution (or other
concrete implementation of the OpenTelemetry API). Using the SDK, an
application can configure how it wants telemetry data to be handled, including
which data should be persisted, how it should be formatted, and where it should
be recorded or exported. However, libraries that produce telemetry data should
generally depend only on OpenTelemetry, deferring the choice of concrete
implementation to the application developer.
