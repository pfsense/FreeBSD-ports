BSDstats is an attempt to produce reasonably accurate statistics on
deployments of BSD operating systems.  This is useful for marketing,
project advocacy, hardware vendors and purchasers, device driver
maintainers, and port maintainers.

The major problem that we are trying to address is vendors who do not
feel that BSD operating systems present enough of a market to bother
supporting.

Meant to be run monthly or during bootup, this script submits
statistics anonymously to a central server (http://bsdstats.org).
Potentially sensitive details like IP addresses and hostnames are not
stored by or relayed through the BSDstats server.
