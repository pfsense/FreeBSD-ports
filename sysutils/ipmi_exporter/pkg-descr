IPMI exporter for Prometheus.
It supports both the regular /metrics endpoint, exposing metrics from the host
that the exporter is running on, as well as an /ipmi endpoint that supports
IPMI over RMCP - one exporter running on one host can be used to monitor a
large number of IPMI interfaces by passing the target parameter to a scrape.
