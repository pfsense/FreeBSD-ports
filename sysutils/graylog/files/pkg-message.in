Please see %%ETCDIR%% for sample versions of graylog.conf, log4j.xml, and
and adjust them for your configuration.

For GeoIP support you need to install the net/GeoIP port and
configure the path to the GeoIP databases in the Graylog Web Interface.

When running graylog in a jail, you need to set enforce_statfs for the jail.

For a single-node installation, install:

- databases/mongodb40 or higher
- textproc/elasticsearch6 or higher

And ensure that the elasticsearch cluster name matches that used by graylog.

docs for more details.

Remember to backup both MongoDB & ES6 databases before upgrading Graylog
itself.
