Ploy is a commandline-tool to provision, manage and control server instances.
What kind of server instances these are depends on the used plugins. There
are plugins for EC2 (ploy_ec2), FreeBSD Jails (ploy_ezjail) and more.

You can create, delete, monitor and ssh into instances while ploy handles the
details like ssh fingerprint checking. Additional plugins provide advanced
functionality like integrating Fabric (ploy_fabric) and Ansible (ploy_ansible).
