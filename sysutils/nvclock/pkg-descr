NVClock is a small utility that allows users to overclock NVidia based
video cards running on *nix platforms.  The original code used in building
this application was borrowed from the nvcs application.  That code has
been extensively reworked in order to make the utility much more user
friendly and to make it play nice with current distributions and drivers.
