U-Boot loader for BeagleBone and BeagleBone Black.

To install this bootloader, copy the files MLO and bb-uboot.img to the FAT
partition on an SD card or the eMMC.  Normally this is partition 1, but
different partitions can be set with U-Boot environment variables.

This version is patched so that:
 * API features are enabled.
 * A boot.scr (U-Boot scripts ) that loads ubldr.bin and execute it is included
