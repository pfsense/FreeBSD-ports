U-Boot loader for OrangePi PC Plus.

To install this bootloader on an sdcard just do :
dd if=/usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-orangepi-pc-plus/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/path/to/sdcarddevice bs=1k seek=8 conv=notrunc,sync

This version is patched so that:
 * API features are enabled.
 * A boot.scr (U-Boot script) that loads ubldr.bin and execute it is included
