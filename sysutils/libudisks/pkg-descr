Udisks provides interfaces to enumerate and perform operations on disks
and storage devices. Any application (including unprivileged ones) can
access the udisks(8) daemon via the name org.freedesktop.Udisks2 on the
system message bus. In addition to the D-bus API, a library, libudisks2,
is also provided. This library can be used from C/C++ and any high-level
language with GObjectIntrospection support such as Javascript and
Python.

This port provides the libudisks library only and is meant for use with
sysutils/bsdisks.
