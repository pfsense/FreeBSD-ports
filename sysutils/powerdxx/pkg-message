***************************************************************************

For CPUs that are supported by the hwpstate driver powerd++ is obsolete and
in fact not possible, because the driver discards frequencies set via the
sysctl interface.

There is a loader tunable that lets you turn it off:

	hint.hwpstate_intel.0.disabled

You can use that if you have issues with hwpstate controlling your CPU
frequency.
