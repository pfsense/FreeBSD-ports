To start using rsyslogd(8), stop syslogd(8) if it is running and
add the following lines to rc.conf(5):

  syslogd_enable="NO"
  rsyslogd_enable="YES"

For best results, create a new configuration file
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rsyslog.conf rather than trying to re-use the original
/etc/syslog.conf -- the configuration file syntax has diverged over
time, and it's no longer anywhere near compatible.

The port will install an example configuration file which should
provide the same logging setup as the default /etc/syslog.conf

newsyslog(8) has the path of syslogd's pid file hardcoded. To
make it work seamlessly with rsyslog, add this:

  rsyslogd_pidfile="/var/run/syslog.pid"
EOM
}
