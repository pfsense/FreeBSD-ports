To use the port you need to perform the following steps:

1) Place your image files into %%DATADIR%%.
2) Add the following to /etc/rc.conf[.local] to enable it:

   splash_changer_enable="YES"

3) Enable the boot splash screen as described in splash(4) and set the

Also, be careful if you already have a file "/boot/splash" because it will be
