A cross-platform Ruby library for retrieving facts from operating systems.
Supports multiple resolution mechanisms, any of which can be restricted to
working only on certain operating systems or environments. Facter is
especially useful for retrieving things like operating system names, IP
addresses, MAC addresses, and SSH keys.
