Moor is a pager that designated to just do the right thing without any
configuration. It reads and displays UTF-8 encoded text from files or pipes.

Doing the right thing includes:

o Syntax highlight source code by default using Chroma
o Search is incremental / find-as-you-type just like in Chrome or Emacs
o Filtering is incremental: Press & to filter the input interactively
o Search becomes case sensitive if you add any UPPER CASE characters
o Snappy UI even on slow / large input with multi-threaded search
o Supports word wrapping
o Mouse Scrolling works out of the box

and more...
