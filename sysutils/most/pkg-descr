most is a pager (like less) that displays, one windowful at a time,
the contents of a file on a terminal.  It pauses after each windowful
and prints the following on the window status line: the screen, the
file name, current line number, and the percentage of the file so far
displayed.

In addition to displaying ordinary text files, most can also display
binary files as well as files with arbitrary ascii characters.  As an
option, autosensing of binary files can be disabled (via the -k
option), thereby allowing one to browse files encoded in a different
language (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, etc).
