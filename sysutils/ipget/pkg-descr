ipget is a standalone program analogous to GNU wget. Unlike wget though, ipget
specializes in downloading files and directory structures from the IPFS network.

ipget includes its own IPFS node, so you don't need IPFS installed on your
system. This makes it ideal for users and projects that want a simple utility
for whenever they want to retrieve files from IPFS.
