Dust is an alternative to du(1) that makes it easier to actually reason about
your disk space utilization. It has bar charts, shows both large directories
and large files where appropriate, and has many filtering options.

Unless your intent was just to pipe du's output, dust is more likely to give
you the utilization information you were actually looking for.
