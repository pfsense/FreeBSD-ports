zdaemon is a Python package which provides APIs for managing
applications run as daemons. Its principal use to date has
been to manage the application server and storage server daemons
for Zope / ZEO, although it is not limited to running Python-based
applications (for instance, it has been used to manage the
'spread' daemon).
