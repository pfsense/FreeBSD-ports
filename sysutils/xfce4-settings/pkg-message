Since XFCE 4.14 was updated to use gtk3 it is suggested to move to
a gtk3 compliant theme.

By default XFCE is installed "unthemed", but the Greybird theme is
installed by the metaport.

The icon theme installed and configured by default is Adwaita. Other
icon themes are available in the ports tree under the x11-themes
category.

To switch to the greybird theme you can:

Launch 'xfce4-appearance-settings', also available in the applications
menu, under settings/appearence, and go to the 'Style' tab to select
the greybird theme.

Then go to 'Window Manager' or launch 'xfwm4-settings' and select the 
greybird theme.

Or launch these command in a shell:
  xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName -t string -s "Greybird"
  xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/theme -t string -s "Greybird"
