ldapvi is tool to update LDAP entries with a text editor.  It is:

  - Written in C;
  - Reasonably fast and small.  The ldapvi client needs about as much time
    for receiving entries as the OpenLDAP server needs to send them, which
    should be fast enough;
  - Shows a summary of changes before committing them.  Details of the
    changes can be previewed in LDIF format;
  - Uses an LDIF-like format in the editor (which should be easier to use
    interactively than standard LDIF);
  - Can rename entries;
  - Does not give up easily.  On error, you can edit the file again, or
    rebind to the server and try again.
