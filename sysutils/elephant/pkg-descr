Elephant - cuz it's phat - is a powerful data provider service and
backend for building custom application launchers and desktop
utilities. It provides various data sources and actions through a
plugin-based architecture, communicating via Unix sockets and Protocol
Buffers.

Elephant acts as a unified backend service that aggregates data from
various sources (desktop applications, files, clipboard history, etc.)
and provides a consistent interface for frontend applications like
custom launchers, productivity tools, or desktop widgets.
