This is the "official" Rust-based tldr client. It is very fast, like tealdeer
(sysutils/tealdeer) but is even more configurable. Where tealdeer gives you
lots of control over colors, tlrc gives you control over formatting, symbols,
and more.

If you don't care about configurability and just want a fast tldr client, this
or tealdeer are both great choices. The most official of all the official
clients is the node-based one, but it's not available in the ports tree and is
orders of magnitude slower than the Rust options.
