Monitor::Simple allows simple monitoring of applications and services of your IT
infrastructure. There are many such tools, some of them very complex and
sophisticated. For example, one widely used is Nagios (http://www.nagios.org/).
The Monitor::Simple does not aim, as its name indicates, for all features
provided by those tools. It allows, however, to check whether your applications
and services are running correctly. Its simple command-line interface can be
used in cron jobs and reports can be viewed as a single HTML or text page.
