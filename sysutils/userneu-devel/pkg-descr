'userneu' is a Perl script that parses a list of usernames and additional
information (such as the real name or other information to be put in the
GECOS field in /etc/passwd) and creates Unix accounts and (if desired)
Samba accounts as well. If the script stumbles upon duplicate user names
it can append random characters to the username until it fits.
