  message: <<EOM
 The following backends are supported by duplicity itself, but will
 require manual installation of their respective dependencies because
 they are not yet available in the ports tree:

   - The Dropbox backend
   - The HSI backend
   - The mega backend for mega.co.nz
   - The swift backend for OpenStack Object Storage
   - The tahoe backend for Tahoe-LAFS

 Please refer to upstream duplicity documentation for information on
 the use of these backends.

 For gnupg 2 insert "pinentry-mode loopback" into ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
 and "allow-loopback-pinentry" into ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

  message: <<EOM
  The sysutils/duplicity port has been updated to 0.8.12, current stable
  release. A new port sysutils/duplicity07 has been created to keep version
  0.7.19 in the tree, as it uses a deprecated version of Python, it will be
  removed soon. It will be kept for a while just in case some incompatibilities
  still show up.

  If you would like to keep using 0.7.19, please run the following command
  to update pkg database:

    pkg set -n duplicity:duplicity07
    pkg set -o sysutils/duplicity:sysutils/duplicity07
