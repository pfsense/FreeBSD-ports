By default, Backrest runs as '%%USER%%', which can be problematic if you want
to restore files in a directory where that user does not have write permissions.
You can change the user that Backrest runs as using 'backrest_runas' in your
'rc.conf(5)' file or create a directory and chown(8)s into it. The latter is
the recommended method.
