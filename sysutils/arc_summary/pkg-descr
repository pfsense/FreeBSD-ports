arc_summary is included in the OpenZFS repository.  It provides basic
information on the ZFS ARC, its efficiency, the L2ARC (if present), the
Data Management Unit (DMU), Virtual Devices (VDEVs), and tunables.  See
the in-source documentation and code at
https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/blob/master/module/zfs/arc.c for details.
