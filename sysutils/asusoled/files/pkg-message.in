Please note this utility requires ugen(4).  Try:

	kldstat -m uhub/ugen

If it is loaded, you will see something like the following:

	Id  Refs Name
	 31    1 uhub/ugen

If it is not loaded, then try:

	kldload ugen

Unfortunately early versions of uhid(4) conflict with ASUS LCM.  If this
utility does not work for you, try unloading it first:

	kldunload uhid

If the driver is compiled into kernel, you cannot unload it, however.
If so, you have to recompile kernel without the uhid support or to fix it
for yourself.  If you don't need uhid, just comment out "device uhid" line
from your kernel configuration file and recompile kernel.  If you need uhid,
you have to touch two files:

http://docs.freebsd.org/cgi/mid.cgi?200803141559.m2EFxWs1074538

To build custom kernel, please read "Configuring the FreeBSD Kernel" section
from the Handbook:

http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig.html

Also, there are two example rcNG scripts, i.e., asusoled and oled_clock.
You can enable 'asusoled' by adding:

	asusoled_enable="YES"

in your /etc/rc.conf.  If you just want to test it, run:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/asusoled forcestart

You will see a black ASUS logo on white background from the display.
Similarly, you can enable or test 'oled_clock', of course. :-)

Enjoy!
