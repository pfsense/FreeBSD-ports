The file renaming utilities consists of five programs designed to make renaming
of files faster and less cumbersome:
- qmv ("quick move") allows a bunch of file names to be edited in a text editor;
- imv ("interactive move") allows a single file name to be edited in the
  terminal using the GNU Readline library
- qcp and icp are similar to qmv and imv but copy files instead of moving them;
- deurlname removes URL encoded characters (such as %20 representing space) from
  file names.
