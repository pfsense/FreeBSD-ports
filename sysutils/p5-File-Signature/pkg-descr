This perl library uses perl5 objects to assist in determining whether a
file's contents or attributes have changed. It maintains several pieces
of information about the file: a digest (currently only MD5 is
supported), its inode number, its mode, the uid of its owner, the gid of
its group owner, and its last modification time.
