Ansible is a radically simple configuration-management, deployment,
task-execution, and multinode orchestration framework.

ansible-base contains the core engine, modules and plugins. It does not
contain community and partner supported Ansible Collections of modules and
plugins.  For future versions of Ansible, ansible-base is going to be
superseded by the ansible-core Python package, available in the FreeBSD
ports as sysutils/py-ansible-core.
