JailManager is a shell script for creating, managing,
updating, and removing jails. It handles initializing the
underlying FreeBSD system, creating jails, handling initial
configuration, updates, and starting/stopping jails.

JailManager runs on FreeBSD 13.x and newer. It does
not require ZFS and works on any BSD filesystem.
