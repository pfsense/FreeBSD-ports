Watching for default routes changes and sets the interface group. When the
default route is added, egress-monitor sets the group of that interface to
appropriate egress. That means for IPv4 and FIB 0 (default one) the group will
be v4fib0egress. In general, the group name is v<4|6>fib<number>egress.
