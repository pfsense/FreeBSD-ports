`tere` is a terminal file explorer. It is a faster alternative to using `cd`
and `ls` to browse folders in your terminal. `tere` only really does one thing:
it provides a TUI for efficiently navigating to a folder, and then prints the
path to that folder when you exit. By configuring your shell to `cd` to the
printed folder, you can move around in your filesystem very quickly.
