Eclat stands for EC2 Command Line Administrator Tool.  It allows you to
manage Amazon EC2 services from the command line, fast and easy.  It does
not require resource-consuming libraries.  It is written in plain C,
depends only on libraries which are always installed on any decent system,
and has low resource requirements.
