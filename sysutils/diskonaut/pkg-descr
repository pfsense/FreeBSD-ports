Given a path on your hard-drive, diskonaut scans it and indexes its metadata to
memory so that you could explore its contents (even while still scanning).

Once completed, you can navigate through subfolders, getting a visual treemap
representation of what's taking up your disk space. You can even delete files or
folders and diskonaut will track how much space you've freed up in this session.
