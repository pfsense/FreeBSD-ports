UDFclient is a userland implementation of the UDF filingsystem as defined by
the OSTA group. UDFclient is designed to be a study platform and a run-up to
a full read and write kernel level implementation.
UDFclient basicly provides a userinterface not unlike ftp(1) but allways
fetches files recursively from the disc(s).
