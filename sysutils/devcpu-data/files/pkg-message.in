This port includes an RC script, which is one of two methods to update the
CPU microcode on a FreeBSD system.

1. The first method, which does not require the RC script included in this
   port is currently only supported on FreeBSD 12.0 or later and Intel i386
   and amd64 processors.  It is the preferred method when available because
   it ensures that any CPU features introduced by a microcode update are
   visible to the kernel by applying the update before the kernel performs
   CPU feature detection.

   To enable updates using the first method, add the following lines to
   /boot/loader.conf:

   cpu_microcode_load="YES"
   cpu_microcode_name="/boot/firmware/intel-ucode.bin"

   The microcode update will be loaded when the system is rebooted.


2. The second method, which uses the RC script included in this port can
   be enabled by adding the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

   microcode_update_enable="YES"

   The microcode update is then applied upon reboot or when the microcode
   update service is run via:

   # service microcode_update start

   If the CPU requires a microcode update, a console message such as the
   following will appear:

   Updating CPU Microcode...
   %%DATADIR%%/m32306c3_00000022.fw: updating cpu /dev/cpuctl0 from rev 0x17 to rev 0x22... done.
   %%DATADIR%%/m32306c3_00000022.fw: updating cpu /dev/cpuctl2 from rev 0x17 to rev 0x22... done.
   %%DATADIR%%/m32306c3_00000022.fw: updating cpu /dev/cpuctl4 from rev 0x17 to rev 0x22... done.
   %%DATADIR%%/m32306c3_00000022.fw: updating cpu /dev/cpuctl6 from rev 0x17 to rev 0x22... done.
   Done.

It is safe to enable both methods.
