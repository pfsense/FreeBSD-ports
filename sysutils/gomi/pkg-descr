gomi is a simple trash tool that works on CLI, written in Go.

The concept of the trashcan does not exist in command-line interface, CLI.
If you have deleted an important file by mistake with the rm(1) command,
it would be difficult to restore in Unix-like systems. Now, gomi makes it
easy to restore deleted files by providing trashcan for the CLI.
