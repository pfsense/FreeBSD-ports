ntfy (pronounced "notify") is a simple HTTP-based pub-sub notification
service. With ntfy, you can send notifications to your phone or
desktop via scripts from any computer, without having to sign up
or pay any fees. If you'd like to run your own instance of the
service, you can easily do so since ntfy is open source.
