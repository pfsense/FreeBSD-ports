This is a port of pwol, a Wake-on-LAN packet utility

pwol is a command line utility to send Wake-On-LAN (WoL)
packets to one or many hosts, either locally or via routers,
in order to wake them up from sleep mode.

It can also be used as a WoL proxy daemon listening to
incoming WoL packets (possibly authenticated) and then
forwarding requests to one or many other targets.
