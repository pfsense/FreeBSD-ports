Alfio is a service that lets you choose which services start at boot
time by using profiles.

For example, if you have a laptop, you might be interested in creating
a profile for when you have access to an internet connection and one
for when you don't. You also might need less services when you boot
your laptop on battery, then decide to save power.
In some situation you might like to connect through DHCP while in
others you need a static IP.
Or you might want to test on your machine how different services
interact with each other without messing with your safe
configuration.

Read the man page (man alfio) to learn how to use it.
