Deskflow is a free and open source keyboard and mouse sharing app. Use
the keyboard, mouse, or trackpad of one computer to control nearby
computers, and work seamlessly between them. It's like a software KVM
(but without the video). TLS encryption is enabled by default. Wayland
is supported. Clipboard sharing is supported.
