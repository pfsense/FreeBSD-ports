This package enables Google Cloud OS Login features on Google Compute Engine
instances.
The OS Login package has the following components:

make them available to sshd.
- NSS Module provides support for making OS Login user and group information
available to the system, using NSS (Name Service Switch) functionality.
- PAM Module provides authorization and authentication support allowing the
system to use data stored in Google Cloud IAM permissions to control both, the
ability to log into an instance, and to perform operations as root (sudo).
- Utils provides common code to support the components listed above.

In addition to the main components, there are also utilities for packaging and
installing these components:
