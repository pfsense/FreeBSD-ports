Setup
=====

Before finishing the setup of QMK by running `qmk setup`, it is advised to
install the python3 package first:

    # pkg install python3

The reason for this is that the qmk_firmware scripts which are downloaded
during the setup expect python3 to be installed (instead of %%PYTHON_CMD%%).

Granting Write Permissions to USB Controllers
=============================================

Flashing images to controllers as a non-root user requires
some additional setup:

1. Add the user to the "operator" group:

        # pw groupmod operator -m piotr

2. Add the following ruleset to /etc/devfs.rules:

        [qmk=10]
        add path 'ttyU*' mode 0660 group operator

3. Enable "qmk" ruleset:

        # sysrc devfs_set_rulesets+="/dev=qmk"

4. Restart the devfs service to load the new rules:

        # service devfs restart
EOM
