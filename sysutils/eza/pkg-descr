eza is a modern, maintained replacement for the venerable
file-listing command-line program ls that ships with Unix
and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and
better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types
and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes,
and Git. And it's small, fast, and just one single binary.

By deliberately making some decisions differently, eza
attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly
version of ls.
