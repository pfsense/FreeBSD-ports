  message: <<EOM
racadm7 has been installed under the linux "compat" tree:
(by default, /compat/linux/opt/dell/srvadmin/bin/idracadm7) due to linux library dependencies.

It is left to the user to alias/symlink this path in their scripts.
Note that under FreeBSD this will not work as a "local" racadm (to operate on an iDrac installed in the machine where it is run).
