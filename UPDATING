This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

20230505:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mutt
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  The patches included in the mail/mutt port will be removed in approximately a
  month making the port more inline with upstream. If you require any of these
  features most are available in mail/neomutt or it's possible to use
  EXTRA_PATCH_TREE to patch a port when building locally.

20230504:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/py-mqttwarn
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The redis optoin REISPUB has been renamed to REDISPUB
  You should update any make.conf setting etc which refer to this.
  e.g. change sysutils_py-mqttwarn_REISPUB to sysutils_py-mqttwarn_REDISPUB

20230416:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mongodb50 and databases/mongodb44
  AUTHOR: ronald@FreeBSD.org

  MongoDB removed the settings 'fork' and 'pidFilePath' from the default
  etc/mongodb.conf file.
  This does not affect mongod started by etc/rc.d/mongod as the settings are
  passed as arguments. Please verify custom uses of mongod.

20230414:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitea
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  Gitea 1.19.1 contains a breaking change.
  actions unit has ben renamed to to repo.actions.

20230407:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/sonarqube-community
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  You need to make sure to update missing and changed values in
     PREFIX/libexec/sonarqube/conf/sonar.properties
  from
     PREFIX/libexec/sonarqube/conf/sonar.properties.sample

20230318:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.6 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20230315:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby30
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 3.0 to 3.1.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 3.0 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 3.0 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=3.0

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkg, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you do not use pkg, please check entry 20190420.
  The description there should also work for this version.

20230314:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssl-devel
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  Users using DEFAULT_VERSIONS=ssl=openssl-devel must update their
  configuration to DEFAULT_VERSIONS=ssl=openssl30 or openssl31.

20230313:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/sqlite3
  AUTHOR: fuz@FreeBSD.org

  Due to various ports not being prepared for this change (see 20230227
  entry), the DQS option of databases/sqlite3 has been reenabled as a
  stop gap measure.  It is scheduled to be disabled again for good no
  earlier than 20240101, giving downstream software authors more time
  to fix their queries.

  See also: https://sqlite.org/quirks.html#dblquote

20230311:
  AFFECTS: users of net/dshell
  AUTHOR: nobutaka@FreeBSD.org

  net/dshell now depends on net/py-pcapy-ng instead of net/py-pcapy.
  Because net/py-pcapy-ng conflicts with net/py-pcapy, please uninstall
  py39-pcapy with the following command before upgrading:
  # pkg delete -f py39-pcapy

20230310:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/unifi7
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  The mongodb dependency has been changed from 36 to 44, as MongoDB 3.6
  is long out out support and end of life.

  The upgrade path should be as following:

  1. Take a backup from within the unifi7 application PRIOR to
     updating!

  2. Stop the unifi7 service (if running)

  3. Copy the "backup" directory from LOCALBASE/share/java/unifi/data
     to a safe location. Also copy keystore and system.properties if
     you have made any modifications to those files

  4. Remove files and directories under LOCALBASE/share/java/unifi/data

  5. Upgrade the package

  6. Copy the "backup" directory from a safe location back to
     LOCALBASE/share/java/unifi/data

  7. Start the service

  8. Restore the configuration from backup

  As an optional step, review system.properties and keystore to merge any
  manual modifications you have made (this has to be done with the application
  stopped)

20230310:
  AFFECTS: user of benchmarks/ddosify
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  keep-alive is removed from config file. In default mode, the engine will use
  keep-alive for all requests. If you want to disable keep-alive for a step, you
  can add Connection: close header to the step.

20230306:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.15.2.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

20230304:
  AFFECTS: users of accessibility/atk and accessibilty/at-spi2-atk
  AUTHOR: tcberner@FreeBSD.org

  The packages accessibility/atk and accessibility/at-spi2-atk have been
  integegrated upstream into at-spi2-core.

  Users of these packages can manually remove them prior to updating
  accessibility/at-spi2-core using

     pkg delete -f atk at-spi2-atk

  if the pkg update process fails due to conflicting files.

20230227:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/sqlite3
  AUTHOR: fuz@FreeBSD.org

  Option DQS is now disabled by default.  This option controls the "double
  quoted string literals are accepted" quirk, permitting the use of double
  quotes around string literals if enabled.  Users who rely on this quirk
  need to manually build databases/sqlite3 with the DQS option enabled.

  See also: https://sqlite.org/quirks.html#dblquote

20230227:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/py-spf-engine
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Default configuration file path of pyspf-milter has changed. Since
  it looks for ${PREFIX}/etc/etc/pyspf-milter/pyspf-milter.conf now,
  you should edit the file if you run pyspf-milter. Alternatively you
  can specify other configuration file path by setting
  pyspf_milter_conffile variable in /etc/rc.conf.

20230222:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. Please make sure that the PostgreSQL server for the NetBox instance is
     running version 11 or higher.  This is because PostgreSQL 10 is
     End-of-Life since November 2022 and Django 4.1 requires PostgreSQL 11
     as a minimum.

  2. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20230218:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql57-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: joneum@FreeBSD.org

  The default MySQL version has been updated from 5.7 to 8.0.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 5.7 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep MySQL 5.7 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=mysql=5.7

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  running server instance. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  on installed packages.

  # pkg set -o databases/mysql57-client:databases/mysql80-client
  # pkg set -o databases/mysql57-server:databases/mysql80-server
  # pkg upgrade

20230213:
  Affects: users of sysutils/nut*
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  The nut file ownership fixups due to the UID/GID change from uucp/uucp
  to nut/nut may not be desireable for all users. Some users with custom
  file ownership may wish ownership to remain untouched. This revision
  to the nut family of ports/packages allows users to optionally disable
  automatic fixup of nut file ownership.

20230213:
  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Since 1.4.1 ${PREFIX}/etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles is empty and
  files to be checked by logcheck are specified in
  ${PREFIX}/etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles.d/syslog.logfiles. So if
  you previously edited the former, then you should edit the latter
  now.

20230210:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  Fetchmail now warns about OpenSSL before 1.1.1s or 3.0.7, and rejects wolfSSL
  older than 5.5.1.

20230209:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/jack
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  audio/jack 1.9.22 fixes an issue with latency correction on FreeBSD.
  Latency correction parameters have to be measured again after update.

20230130:
  AFFECTS: users of USES=nodejs, www/node*, www/npm* and www/yarn*
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  The current USES=nodejs has the following issues:
  - www/node is not the default version while www/node16 is.
  - It also means inconsistent naming of node ports.
  - www/npm duplicates with www/npm-node16.
  - www/yarn duplicates with www/yarn-node16.

  The notable changes are introduced to fix the above issues:
  - Rewrite Mk/Uses/nodejs.mk.
  - Add new LTS version of nodejs (www/node18).
  - Add new current version of nodejs (www/node19).
  - Change default nodejs version from 16 to 18 (latest LTS),
  - Use consistent naming for all supported node versions.
  - Convert www/node, www/npm and www/yarn to meta ports.

  After these changes:
  - All supported node versions are named as node{14,16,18,19}.
  - www/node is a meta port which depends on the default version
    (e.g. www/node18)
  - www/npm is a meta port which depends on the default version
    (e.g. www/npm-node18)
  - www/yarn is a meta port which depends on the default version
    (e.g. www/yarn-node18)

20230129:
  AFFECTS: users of benchmarks/ddosify
  AUTHOR: fernape@freebsd.org

  In 0.13.0 some configuration keys have been renamed for consistency. Have a
  look at https://github.com/ddosify/ddosify/releases/tag/v0.13.0 for details.

20230127:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn
  AUTHOR: mandree@freebsd.org

  OpenVPN has been updated to the new upstream release v2.6.0, which
  is quite compatible with v2.5 versions.

  A copy of the latest v2.5.8 port is being kept as security/openvpn25 (or
  openvpn25 package) until end of March 2023.

20230116:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/nut and sysutils/nut-devel
  AUTHOR: cy@freebsd.org

  As of PR/268960 Network UPS Tools will now run under its own UID and GID
  instead of uucp. Users who wish to continue using the uucp user and
  group may add NUT_USER=uucp and NUT_GROUP=uucp to their make.conf.

  After upgrading sysutils/nut or sysutils/nut-devel with this patch,
  restart devd. Then restart nut. This will fix up the permissions of
  UPS USB devices and allow nut to start normally.

20230111:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/graylog
  AUTHOR: dch@freebsd.org

  Graylog 5.x and higher effectively constrains ElasticSearch
  dependencies, and in most cases will force a migration to
  OpenSearch 2.x, now available in ports. Plan accordingly.

20230104:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spamassassin
  AUTHOR: cy@freebsd.org

  As of spamassassin 4.0.0 (3fdfceb36029) the deprecated HashCash plug-in
  was finally removed. Users using the HashCash plug-in will need to
  remove references to it.

20221226:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/zrepl
  AUTHOR: driesm@FreeBSD.org

  The Prometheus metric zrepl_version_daemon has been converted to the
  zrepl_start_time metric. The metric still reports the zrepl verison in a
  label. But the metric value is now the Unix timestamp at the time the
  daemon was started. The Grafana dashboard in dist/grafana has been
  updated.

  The RPC protocol version has also been bumped; all zrepl daemons in a
  setup must be updated and restarted before replication can resume.

20221220:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/unbound_exporter
  AUTHOR: thomas@beingboiled.info

  The config defaults for the log file and certificates have been changed.
  See /usr/local/etc/rc.d/unbound_exporter for possible options and adjust
  your rc.conf accordingly.

20221215:
  AFFECTS: users of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Many users report that after updating ClamAV to 1.0.0 clamd and
  freshclam fails to start with integrity check error of
  databases. According to the result of investigation it happens with
  following conditions.

  1. ClamAV is built on non-cleanroom environment (that is, neither
     FreeBSD official ClamAV package is used nor the package is built
     by user with poudriere).
  2. math/tomsfastmath is installed in the system that ClamAV is
     built.

  So if the errror happens on you system, uninstall TomsFastMath first
  and then rebuild and reinstall ClamAV. The problem should disappear.

20221128:
  AFFECTS: devel/py-proxmoxer
  AUTHOR: einar@isnic.is

  AuthenticationError Moved

  proxmoxer.backends.https.AuthenticationError was moved to
  proxmoxer.AuthenticationError (the class itself is the same).
  Any imports or references to proxmoxer.backends.https.AuthenticationError
  should be changed to proxmoxer.AuthenticationError.

  ProxmoxResourceBase Removed

  While this should be a fully internal change, the ProxmoxResourceBase
  class was removed. Use ProxmoxResource instead.

  Removed ProxmoxHTTPTicketAuth

  The auth_token and csrf_token arguments are no longer supported. If an
  existing (still valid) token needs to be used, you can pass the token
  as password and proxmoxer will attempt to renew the ticket and retrieve
  a new token and CSRF token.

20221126:
  AFFECTS: textproc/kibana8
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  kibana8 now installs kibana-specific utilities into LOCALBASE/bin as symbolic
  links.

  Please check whether it will overwrite your local files with names same as
  these utilities and if so, please rename them or move out of the way in a
  different manner.

20221126:
  AFFECTS: textproc/elasticsearch8
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  elasticsearch8 now installs elasticsearch-specific utilities into
  LOCALBASE/bin as symbolic links (i.e. elasticsearch-cli and similar).

  Please check whether it will overwrite your local files with names same
  as these utilities and if so, please rename them or move out of the way
  in a different manner.

20221126:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php80
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 8.0 to 8.1.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info \*php80\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php80 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php81.

20221123:
  AFFECTS: x11-wm/jwm
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  jwm 2.4 introduces changes in the configuration.  To convert an existing v2.3
  configuration file using xsltproc, run:

  cp ~/.jwmrc ~/.jwmrc.old
  xsltproc jwm-2.4.xslt ~/.jwmrc.old > ~/.jwmrc

  If you have multiple configuration files, it may be necessary to apply the
  XSLT to some or all of them depending on what configuration options are stored
  in the file.

20221017:
  AFFECTS: archivers/star
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  With the update of devel/schilybase to 2022-10-16 a new port archivers/tartest
  has been splitted off from archivers/star.

20221016:
  AFFECTS: textproc/apache-solr
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Apache solr version 9 is released and made available as extra port
  textproc/apache-solr9.
  Version 9 cannot start directly with data from version 8. Additional steps
  for data migration is required.
  If you like to use the new version, deinstall the old version and install
  the new version:
  # pkg delete apache-solr
  # pkg install apache-solr9
  After this you need to migrate data and migration, for this check the solr
  documentation.

20221015:
  AFFECTS: users of gstreamer1-* when upgrading via port builds on the host
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  The update of the gstreamer1-* ports to 1.20.3 requires a clean install of
  gstreamer1-* ports. In particular, when trying to update ports in-place using
  portupgrade or portmaster, the builds are likely to fail due to dependency
  mismatches. If this is your preferred update path, you need to deinstall
  (pkg delete -f) gstreamer1 and the plugins before reinstalling them from
  the ports tree.
  Note that pkg upgrade will do the right thing: If you use official FreeBSD
  packages or build your own set of packages using poudriere, nothing special
  is needed.

20221012:
  AFFECTS: devel/websvn
  AUTHOR: michael.osipov@siemens.com

  WebSVN 2.8.0 includes full PHP 8.x support which requires a change from PEAR
  to Composer 2. You must manually install dependencies through it, the ports
  system will not handle it anymore for you since */horde* (PR 266552) has been
  marked as incompatible with PHP 8.x for the time being. See pkg-message for
  detailed instructions.

20221011:
  AFFECTS: users of security/acme.sh
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  This update may break your install if you were using a symlink to
  %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/acme.sh.conf - that file is no longer installed. Instead,
  a log rotation configuration is now installed to etc/cron.d/acme.sh.sample
  you should modify etc/cron.d/acme.sh to needs.

  The port now installs a log rotation file to etc/newsyslog.d/acme.sh.sample
  and you you should update etc/newsyslog.d/acme.sh to suit your needs.
  This file has long been part of the port, but was never installed.

  Neither the log rotation nor the crontab are active until you remove the
  comments.

20221002:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  Bash has been updated to version 5.2. In previous versions, the default port
  option-set used to link against libreadline from ports. However, the current
  version of devel/readline is too old for bash 5.2.

  For now, the default option has been switched to use the bundled version of
  libreadline and the other option is marked broken. Once devel/readline is
  updated this can be reverted.

  If you're updating bash from source and you've previously explicitly set to
  use use PORTS_READLINE, you'll have to disable the PORTS_READLINE option
  before updating:

  # cd /usr/ports/shells/bash
  # make config

   or flush it entirely:

  # cd /usr/ports/shells/bash
  # make rmconfig

20220929:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/bmeps
  AUTHOR: takefu@airport.fm

  The executable name has been changed from this edition from bmpp to bitmap2pp

20220925:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.5 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20220919:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/strawberry
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  strawberry now uses FLAVORs based on the qt version, offering -qt5 and
  -qt6, with -qt5 the default.

  You may need to explicitly install either of the new flavors.

20220919:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/schilyutils
  AUTHOR: fuz@fuz.su

  Schilyutils has been split up into two ports. If you want the bosh shell,
  the new port is shells/bosh, which can be installed with:

  # pkg install bosh
    or
  # portmaster -o shells/bosh

20220918:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/roundcube
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  Roundcube has been upgraded to 1.6.0 and introduces breaking changes to
  configuration options of remote services (imap, smtp, ldap, sieve). Check
  https://roundcube.net/news/2022/07/28/roundcube-1.6.0-released for details.

  Version 1.6 no longer includes the Classic and Larry skins, which are now
  available as separate mail/roundcube-classic and mail/roundcube-larry ports.

20220910:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/cmake
  AUTHOR: diizzy@FreeBSD.org

  CMake has been converted to a meta-port and new CMake packages created causes
  conflicts with old binary packages prior to this change.

  If CMake was installed using binary packages via pkg it needs to be
  uninstalled using pkg delete before installing CMake and related packages
  after this change.

    pkg delete cmake
    pkg install cmake-core

  If you're using portmaster you also need to delete the old CMake package
  before upgrading.

20220909:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/qemu has been updated to 7.1.0. Previous 7.0.X branch has
  been repocopied to emulators/qemu70. If someone wants to stick with 7.0.X
  branch please use one of the following command:

  # pkg install qemu70/qemu70-nox11(based on flavor used)
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu70 emulators/qemu
    or
  # portupgrade -o emulators/qemu70 emulators/qemu

20220903:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The Vim port no longer installs a system-wide vimrc. It drastically affected
  config loading order, and led to various settings being clobbered, duplicated,
  or ignored.

  Vim's provided defaults.vim (/usr/local/share/vim/vim90/defaults.vim) continues
  to be read just as before, but its settings are no longer clobbered. Take a look
  in there for any settings you may want to change, and do ':h initialization' to
  see where Vim looks for config files.

20220903:
  AFFECTS: users of archivers/py-borgbackup
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Borgbackup has been upgraded to version 1.2.  For users who you wish to
  continue using version 1.1, use either of these commands for upgrading:

  With binary packages through pkg:
    pkg set -o archivers/py-borgbackup:archivers/py-borgbackup11
    pkg upgrade
  With portmaster or portupgrade (replace the command accordingly):
    portmaster -o archivers/py-borgbackup11 archivers/py-borgbackup

20220901:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/rainloop-community
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Since 1.17.0 upstream distributes only one "legacy" edition under MIT license
  and mail/rainloop-community is removed as a result. So please uninstall
  mail/rainloop-community (rainloop-community-phpXY) and install mail/rainloop
  (rainloop-phpXY) instead.

20220831:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xscreensaver on 13.1-RELEASE
  AUTHOR: zirias@FreeBSD.org

  With the update to 6.04, xscreensaver now uses security/unix-selfauth-helper
  for PAM authentication. This relies on pam_exec.so, which had a bug causing
  a segfault on authentication attempts prior to 13.1-RELEASE-p1. For details,
  please see
  https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-EN-22:19.pam_exec.asc

  Make sure your system is fully upgraded, otherwise you might be unable to
  unlock your screen.

20220825:
  AFFECTS: users of net/xrdp or net/xrdp-devel
  AUTHOR: meta@FreeBSD.org

  After xorg upgrade to 21.1.4, xorgxrdp session doesn't start as before
  This is because bin/Xorg has been replaced with X server binary wrapper.
  You must manually edit the Xorg section in etc/xrdp/sesman.ini to get it
  working again.

  The following is a short example of where, how to modify sesman.ini.
  Make sure to replace LOCALBASE with your actual path.

   [Xorg]

20220815:
  AFFECTS: users of net/keycloak
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  The flavors -mysql and -postgres were removed, the necessary configuration
  for those database backends was rolled into the base release by upstream.
  The configuration files changed completely, so they need to be rebuilt from
  scratch.

  AFFECTS: users of security/stunnel
  AUTHOR: zi@FreeBSD.org

  The stunnel port has been updated to drop privileges to the stunnel
  user by default.

  As a result of this change, the pid file location has changed.  If
  you have a running copy of stunnel, you should stop the process
  before performing the upgrade.  Alternatively, you will need to
  # pkill stunnel;service stunnel start
  after the upgrade has been completed.

  AFFECTS: updating x11-servers/xorg-server from a port
  AUTHOR: se@FreeBSD.org

  The xorg-server port now has a library dependency on x11/libxcvt,
  which cannot be installed when the previous version of xorg-server
  is present.  To be able to update xorg-server from a port, the
  previous version needs to be manually deinstalled to allow libxcvt
  to be installed.

  AFFECTS: users of Erlang and Elixir
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  For more than a decade, the Elixir Mix tool and the Erlang rebar
  or erlang.mk build tools have been the de facto way of installing
  and managing packages for specific applications.

  All main-stream applications, from Riak, CouchDB, RabbitMQ, Phoenix,
  and Elixir, expect that packages are fetched and compiled into an OTP
  Release, with in-built version locking, external package management.

  There is no point in maintaining a large number of libraries, that
  are used neither for development, nor operations.

  Users are directed to https://rebar3.org/ https://erlang.mk/ or
  https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html
  to fetch custom packages.

20220626:
  AFFECTS: users of python
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of python3 and python was switched to 3.9.

  For ports users wanting to keep version 3.8 as default,
  add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= python=3.8 python3=3.8 to make.conf

  Following procedures may ease the upgrade:

  For users of pre-build packages:
  # sh
  # for i in $(pkg query -g %n 'py38-*'); do pkg set -yn ${i}:py39-${i#py38-}; done
  # pkg upgrade

  For portmaster users:
  # sh
  # portmaster -o lang/python39 python38
  # REINSTALL="$(pkg info -o "*py38*" | awk '{printf "%s ", $2}')"
  # pkg delete -f "*py38*"
  # portmaster $REINSTALL
  # REBUILD=$(pkg query -g "%n:%dn" '*' | grep py3 | grep -v py39 | cut -d : -f 1 | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD
  # REBUILD2=$(pkg list | grep python-38 | xargs pkg which | awk '{print $6}' | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD2

  Final steps (for pre-built packages & portmaster):

  If no longer required, Python 3.8 can be removed via
  "pkg remove python38" and the directory /usr/local/lib/python3.8 can
  then be deleted afterwards, if not empty.

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/fusefs-bindfs
  AUTHOR: doralitze@chaotikum.org

  Bindfs defaults to use direct I/O since version 1.16. While this results
  in major performance improvements as well as several bug fixes, this also
  breaks direct legacy calls to mmap. If your application still uses them
  consider these two options:

  1. Mount using `--no-direct-io`
  2. Upgrade your application in order to query mapping guards

20220623:
  AFFECTS: users of science/gramps
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  databases/py-bsddb3 is deprecated and will be removed in the future. With that
  gramps will lose the ability to load family trees using Berkeley DB.
  It is suggested to migrate all family trees using Berkeley DB by exporting
  them to gramps xml and import that gramps xml into a family tree using sqlite
  as database.

20220620:
  AFFECTS: users of www/selenium
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  The port has changed startup args so if you are using selenium_args= in
  rc.conf you need to add the parameter "standalone" manually.

20220616:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  The NetBox 3.2 release contains major changes, so at least items 1.), 2.)
  and 3.) must be checked before proceeding with the upgrade!

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  1. This release includes a database migration that will remove the "asn",
     "contact_name", "contact_phone", and "contact_email" fields from the
     site model.  (These fields have been superseded by the ASN and contact
     models introduced in NetBox v3.1.)

     To protect against the accidental destruction of data, the upgrade
     process will fail if any sites still have data in any of these fields.

     To bypass this safeguard, set the NETBOX_DELETE_LEGACY_DATA environment
     variable when running the upgrade script, which will permit the
     destruction of legacy data.

     A set of migration scripts is available to assist with the migration of
     legacy site data:

     https://github.com/netbox-community/migration-scripts

  2. NetBox v3.2 requires Python 3.8 or later.

  3. If the NetBox Plugin "net-mgmt/py-netbox-plugin-extension" is used,
     please disable it before the migrations are applied.  This can be done
     by removing the entry "netbox_plugin_extensions" from the "PLUGINS"
     section in the NetBox configuration.

     Once the upgrade is done, this port/package can be safely removed as
     it's no longer required.

  4. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20220608:
  AFFECTS: devel/autoconf-wrapper, devel/autoconf213
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  These ports have been renamed to devel/autoconf-switch and devel/autoconf2.13
  respectively.  If your favourite port updating tool cannot handle that then
  just remove the packages with "pkg delete" and then install the new port.

20220607:
  AFFECTS: security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  OpenSSH has been updated to 9.0p1 with incompatible changes.
  See https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.0 for details.

20220602:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/graylog
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  Graylog 4.3.0+ fails to start if graylog's internal collector for
  system statistics is enabled. This will eventually be addressed
  upstream.

  Add disable_native_system_stats_collector=true to your graylog.conf.

20220513:
  AFFECTS: devel/nexus2-oss
  AUTHOR: michael.osipov@siemens.com

  Nexus 2.15.x introduces incompatible configuration changes. You
  must review changes in ETCDIR/wrapper.conf and ETCDIR/jetty*.xml
  with updated samples as well as NEXUS_WORKDIR/conf/logback-nexus.xml
  with its origin from
  DATADIR/nexus/WEB-INF/lib/nexus-core-VERSION.jar!/META-INF/log/logback-nexus.xml,
  grant write access to files in ETCDIR since Nexus itself might
  update files in place otherwise your instance will not properly
  work after the update.

20220510
  AFFECTS: sysutils/zrepl
  AUTHOR: monwarez@gmail.com

  The zrepl update to 0.5.0.8 includes the following breaking changes:
  - The Prometheus metric zrepl_version_daemon was converted to zrepl_start_time
  The metric still reports the zrepl version in a label.
  But the metric *value* is now the Unix timestamp at the time the daemon was started.
  The Grafana dashboard in zrepl examples directory has been updated.

20220502:
  AFFECTS: mail/mutt
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  Default header cache option has been changed to the new option LMDB using
  databases/lmdb. The BDB option still exists but now uses databases/db18 due
  to the EOL of databases/db5.

20220501:
  AFFECTS: users of drm-current-kmod and drm-devel-kmod
  AUTHOR: manu@FreeBSD.org

  Both ports where removed.
  If you were using either one of them directly (i.e. without using
  graphics/drm-kmod metaport) use graphics/drm-510-kmod.
  If you have some problems with this one try drm-54-kmod and report
  a bug on https://github.com/freebsd/drm-kmod.

20220428:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/redis port has been updated to 7.0. Users wanting to
  stay on 6.2 can replace databases/redis with databases/redis62 with
  one of the following commands.

  If you use pkg with binary packages:
    # pkg set -o databases/redis:databases/redis62
    # pkg upgrade
  If you use portmaster:
    # portmaster -o databases/redis62 databases/redis
  If you use portupgrade:
    # portupgrade -o databases/redis62 databases/redis

20220426:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/grantleetheme
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The pkg update of deskutils/grantleetheme to 22.04 can fail due
  to a filesystem location having changed from being a file to being
  a directory. This leads to pkg's temporary file creation throwing
  an error.

  To update to KDE Gear 22.04 please run
  # pkg delete -f grantleetheme
  prior to the update.

20220424:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/qemu has been updated to 7.0.0. Previous 6.2.X branch has
  been repocopied to emulators/qemu6. If someone wants to stick with 6.2.X
  branch please use one of the following command:

  # pkg install qemu6/qemu6-nox11(based on flavor used)
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu6 emulators/qemu
    or
  # portupgrade -o emulators/qemu6 emulators/qemu

20220421:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby27
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.7 to 3.0.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.7 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.7 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.7

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkg, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you do not use pkg, please check entry 20190420.
  The description there should also work for this version.

20220413:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/py-matrix-synapse
  AUTHOR: ports@skyforge.at

  Synapse will now refuse to start up if open registration is enabled,
  in order to help mitigate abuse across the federation. If you would
  like to provide registration to anyone, consider adding email,
  recaptcha or token-based verification in order to prevent automated
  registration from bad actors. This check can be disabled by setting
  the enable_registration_without_verification option in your
  homeserver configuration file to true. More details are available in
  the upgrade notes[0].

  Synapse will additionally now refuse to start when using PostgreSQL
  with a non-C values for COLLATE and CTYPE, unless the config flag
  allow_unsafe_locale, found in the database section of the
  configuration file, is set to true. See the upgrade notes[1] for
  details.

20220410:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/screen
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  As of sysutils/screen-4.9.0_5, the MULTUSER option is default, reverting
  to the traditional setuid-root behavior. People who wish to secure their
  screen install must terminate all screen sessions, then install screen
  without the MULTIUSER option. The option was reversed because it caused
  too much astonishment among users of screen.

20220401:
  AFFECTS: security/sshguard
  AUTHOR: kevinz5000@gmail.com

  Blacklisting is now disabled by default to avoid overriding the setting in
  sshguard.conf. To enable blacklisting, uncomment the BLACKLIST_FILE line in
  sshguard.conf.

20220329:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/screen
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  As of sysutils/screen-4.9.0_3, the multiuser feature is not supported
  by default. The multiuser feature requires setuid root to function.
  This creates a security risk. Some Linux distributions have had
  non-setuuid root screen for a dozen or more years. FreeBSD is following
  suit. A new MULTIUSER option has been added to enable users to install
  setuid root screen. The MULTIUSER option default is OFF.

  Users who wish to use the multiuser feature may,

  - Build screen using the MULTIUSER option, or
  - Poudriere users can use poudriere-options to enable the MULTIUSER
    option, or
  - Users can chmod the setuid bit for ${LOCALBASE}/bin/screen-4.9.0,
    making screen setuid root to enable the multiuser feature.

20220326:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/freebsd-doc-*
  AUTHOR: blackend@FreeBSD.org

  A change to the doc toolchain prevents the build of individual
  localized HTML versions of the documentation without building the
  en_US version.  HTML option is currently disabled until a good
  solution is found.  PDF version, the default option, is now the only
  available option.

  Please re-run "make config" to pick up this new default.

20220313:
  AFFECTS: users of net/unison
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  unison has been updated to version 2.52. The new version introduces
  a new wire protocol and on disk archive format. This new version
  is compatible with 2.51 clients for communication, so it's now
  possible to upgrade one side and then the other.

  The archive files are automatically converted to the new version,
  but once they are converted the y are incompatible with the
  previous version.

  In case you need version 2.51, the previous version of the port
  is preserved in net/unison251.

20220311:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/get_iplayer

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/intel-pcm-devel
  AUTHOR: egypcio@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/intel-pcm-devel became quite obsolete once sysutils/intel-pcm is
  now pretty much following a constant and stable update cycle, so users of
  the -devel version are encouraged to switch to it.

  If you still have sysutils/intel-pcm-devel installed, please delete it from
  your system and install sysutils/intel-pcm instead:

  # pkg delete sysutils/intel-pcm-devel
  # pkg install sysutils/intel-pcm

20220219:
  AFFECTS: users of math/qhull*
  AUTHOR: stephen@FreeBSD.org

  Because of entries in MOVED, portupgrade can get confused updating qhull.

  then reinstalling all the dependent ports.

20220218:
  AFFECTS: users of TeX*
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  TeX system has been updated to 2021 from 2015. Normal pkg upgrade or
  portmaster -a should handle all the upgrade properly. In case not please
  create a ticket or send a mail to tex@FreeBSD.org

  print/tex-aleph has been removed as per upstream. This package should be
  removed manually. Additionally users have reported to delete
  texlive-texmf prior to starting update, or pkg-static will indicate
  there is a conflict during the upgrade of texlive-base :

  # pkg remove tex-aleph texlive-texmf

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The storage directory has moved from WWWDIR to /var/db/librenms/storage

  this symlink.

20220212:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php8[01][-extensions]?
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  Non-Default OPTION MYSQL80 has been removed in lieu of making
  php8[01]-openssl as part of DEFAULT php8[01] installation. Although
  for php74 it is not the case. Ports that depends on
  security/php8[01]-openssl will no longer be installed as these have
  been removed. There is no side effect of this for ports which have
  USE_PHP=openssl. In case for php74 as the default php74-openssl will
  be installed otherwise it will be used from php installation.

  If you are using pkg, you have to remove php8[01]-openssl manually after
  the upgrade :

  # pkg info \*php8\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  # pkg upgrade -y
  # pkg delete -f php8[01]-openssl
  # service -R

  While rebuilding from ports users old php.conf is not overwritten. So
  have to manually remove the ports. For portmaster users:
  # sh
  # REINSTALL="$(pkg info -o "*php80*" | grep -v openssl | awk '{printf "%s ", $2}')"
  # pkg delete -f "*php80*"
  # portmaster $REINSTALL
  # portmaster -a

20220207:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-new
  AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  Amavis does now depend on archivers/7-zip (7zz) you might need to update

20220129:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/neovim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Neovim now uses luajit-openresty as the Lua provider. Many neovim plugins
  compile some of their code (Packer does this, as do many LSP plugins).
  Neovim will produce errors and fail to load the plugins.

  Deleting and reinstalling any plugins that produce errors should fix the
  startup.

  If you use Packer, you also want to delete the startup cache:

  # rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/plugin/packer_compiled.lua

  AFFECTS: users of mail/bogofilter, mail/bogofilter-lmdb
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of mail/bogofilter now uses LMDB instead
  of Berkeley DB. It is not compatible and cannot read databases.

  Your options are:
  1. use bogoutil on each wordlist for each of your users first,
  ONLY THEN reinstall bogofilter, THEN reload the databases with bogoutil,
  OR
  2. install the matching bogofilter version and
  If you had been using bogofilter-lmdb so far, install bogofilter.
  If you had been using bogofilter so far, install bogofilter-bdb.

20220125:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php74
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 7.4 to 8.0.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info \*php7\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php74 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php80.

20220120:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/dwm
  AUTHOR: 0mp@FreeBSD.org

  dwm has been updated to 6.3. The option RUGAPS is no longer available because

  updated, the emacs major version has been removed from these package
  names.

  For example, the old and new package names of devel/magit are

  -----------------------------------------------------------
  | Old Package Name          | New Package Name            |
  |-------------------------- |-----------------------------|
  | magit-emacs27             | magit                       |
  | magit-emacs27_nox         | magit-emacs_nox             |
  | magit-emacs27_canna       | magit-emacs_canna           |
  |                           |                             |
  | magit-emacs29_nox         | magit-emacs_devel_nox       |
  | magit-emacs29             | magit-emacs_devel           |
  -----------------------------------------------------------

  To handle these final package name changes, follow a similar procedure
  as the one described in the 20200811 entry.  That is, simply running
  `pkg upgrade` will not upgrade, e.g., foo-emacs27_nox to
  foo-emacs_nox.

  Binary package users:

  To update these packages, run these commands under /bin/sh with superuser
  privileges before upgrading.

  # default flavor of editors/emacs installed
  for i in $(pkg query -g %n '*-emacs27'); do
    if [ "$i" != "notmuch-emacs27" ]; then
      nn=$(echo "$i" | sed -e 's/-emacs27//')
    else
      nn=$(echo "$i" | sed -e 's/-emacs27/-emacs/')
    fi
    pkg set -yn "$i":"$nn"
  done

  # canna or nox flavor of editors/emacs installed
  for i in $(pkg query -g %n '*-emacs27*'); do
    nn=$(echo "$i" | sed -e 's/emacs27/emacs/')
    pkg set -yn "$i":"$nn"
  done

  # editors/emacs-devel installed
  for i in $(pkg query -g %n '*-emacs29*'); do
    nn=$(echo "$i" | sed -e 's/emacs29/emacs_devel/')
    pkg set -yn "$i":"$nn"
  done

  portmaster users:

  portmaster -r emacs

  AFFECTS: users of www/node*, www/npm*, www/yarn*
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The port framework was updated to use a default version for nodejs.
  The default version is pointing to the latest LTS version which is
  currently version 16.
  You can overwrite this by defining in /etc/make.conf, e.g. version 17:
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS=nodejs=17

  Or if you would like to stick always to the current version use:
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS=nodejs=current

  If you would like to use yarn or npm together with nodejs version 17,
  just install the package that is pulling the wanted dependency to nodejs:

  # pkg install yarn-node17
  # pkg install npm-node17

20211109:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.4 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20211107:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/devcpu-data
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  The RC variable name microcode_cpus is now deprecated.  Users should
  instead use the variable microcode_update_cpus.

  Two new ports were branched from sysutils/devcpu-data,
  sysustils/devcpu-data-amd and sysustils/devcpu-data-intel.  The two
  new ports contain only the CPU microcode updates for each vendor and
  sysutils/devcpu-data now only contains an RC script.  Both new ports
  are on-by-default, optional dependencies of sysutils/devcpu-data.

20211101:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/redisearch
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The textproc/redisearch port has been updated to the recent stable
  release - v2.2.  Users wanting to stay on v2.0 can replace
  textproc/redisearch with textproc/redisearch20 with one of the
  following commands:

  # pkg install textproc/redisearch20
    or
  # portmaster -o textproc/redisearch20 textproc/redisearch
    or
  # portupgrade -o textproc/redisearch20 textproc/redisearch

  NOTE: The textproc/redisearch20 brings a new name for the module,
  i.e. redisearch20.so, so be careful.

20211024:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/beats7
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  The following breaking changes apply to beats 7.15.0 and newer:

    - All beats:
    Loading Kibana assets (dashboards, index templates) rely on Saved Object API.
    So to provide a reliable service, Beats can only import and export dashboards
    using at least Kibana 7.15.

    - Filebeat:
      - Remove all alias fields pointing to ECS fields from modules. This affects
        the Suricata and Traefik modules.
      - Fix Crowdstrike ingest pipeline that was creating flattened process fields.
      - Rename log.path to log.file.path in filestream to be consistent with log
        input and ECS.

    - Heartbeat:
      - Remove long deprecated watch_poll functionality.
      - Fix inconsistency in event.dataset values between heartbeat and fleet by
        always setting this value to the monitor type / fleet dataset.

    - Metricbeat:
      - Fix Elasticsearch jvm.gc.collectors.old being exposed as young

20211024:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 12 to 13.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 12.8, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql12-server postgresql12-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql12-server-12.8.pkg -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql12-contrib-12.8.pkg -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql12-server databases/postgresql12-contrib databases/postgresql12-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql13-server databases/postgresql13-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql13-server databases/postgresql13-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql13-server databases/postgresql13-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # su -l postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/initdb --encoding=utf-8 --lc-collate=C -D /var/db/postgres/data13 -U postgres"
  # su -l postgres -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /var/db/postgres/data12/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /var/db/postgres/data13/ -U postgres "

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  ATTENTION:
  1) The default user changed from "pgsql" to "postgres" in 11. The migration steps above now assume
     the "postgres" database user and FreeBSD user.
  2) See the updating entry 20190829 if you are updating from a release prior to 11.
  3) If you use non-default initdb options, you have to adjust the initdb-command accordingly

20211023:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v17.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node16, has been created for the
  upcoming v16.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v16.x can replace
  www/node with www/node16 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node16
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node16 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node16 www/node

20211012:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  devel/git port was split into multiple sub-ports that depend on devel/git
  and install additional files:

  - devel/git-cvs - CVS related scripts and man pages
  - devel/git-gui - GUI related scripts and man pages
  - devel/git-p4  - Perforce related scripts and man pages
  - devel/git-svn - Subversion related scripts and man pages

  Due to these changes, CVS, GUI, PERFORCE, and SUBVERSION options
  as well as gui and svn flavors were removed from the port.

20211010:
  AFFECTS: users of gtk2 flavored devel/geany*
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream dropped support for gtk2. Due to this the ports are now
  unflavored, installing only with gtk3 support.

  If you are already using the default gtk3 flavor will get the new
  version with a simple "pkg upgrade".

  To upgrade when using the gtk2 flavors you need to use "pkg install"
  to install the new unflavored gtk3 packages, pkg will automatically
  uninstall the old gtk2 flavors.

  If using ports, you will need to uninstall all geany packages and
  its plugins and reinstall from an updated ports tree.

  The "geany-plugin-multiterm" plugin was only available as a gtk2
  flavor when installing the gtk2 flavor of geany and has not been
  ported to gtk3, so has been removed from the tree, so the
  geany-plugin-multiterm-gtk2 package should be removed from the system.

20211007:
  AFFECTS: user of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream changed end-of-life policy and introduced long time support
  (LTS) feature release.

  * LTS feature release will be identified approximately every two
    years and supported for at least three years from the initial
    publication date of that LTS feature version.
  * Regular (non-LTS) feature releases will be supported for at least
    four months from the initial publication date of the next feature
    release or until the feature release after that is published.

  According to it new port security/clamav-lts is added for users who
  want to use LTS version of ClamAV.

  Users wanting to switch to LTS version can replace security/clamav
  with security/clamav-lts with one of following commands.

  If you use pkg with binary packages:
    # pkg set -o security/clamav:security/clamav-lts
    # pkg upgrade
  If you use portmaster:
    # portmaster -o security/clamav-lts security/clamav
  If you use portupgrade:
    # portupgrade -o security/clamav-lts security/clamav

20211006:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/freebsd-doc-*
  AUTHOR: blackend@FreeBSD.org

The misc/freebsd-doc-* ports have been updated to the new doc toolchain,
and use a somewhat different arrangement of directories and symlinks,
which pkg 1.17 does not handle well.

Users are encouraged to delete the misc/freebsd-doc-* ports, then
reinstall the new ones without using the pkg upgrade facility.

20211006:
  AFFECTS: users of net/kafkacat
  AUTHOR: sergey@akhmatov.ru

  kafkacat has been renamed to kcat upstream.
  So switch to net/kcat instead.

20211004:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  The NetBox 3.0 release contains major changes, so at least items 1.), 2.)
  and 3.) must be checked before proceeding with the upgrade!

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  1. Please ensure that your local installation of net-mgmt/netbox is at
     the 2.11 release before attempting to upgrade to NetBox 3.0 or later.

  2. Please also note that the previously deprecated secrets functionality
     has been removed with NetBox 3.0.  This means, all of the secrets still
     remain in the database once upgraded, only the secrets functionality on
     the part of NetBox is no longer given.

     In order to continue to be able to access the stored secrets as usual
     (and then possibly migrate them to another solution, e.g.
     security/vault), please install the security/py-netbox-secretstore port
     once NetBox has been upgraded to 3.x and follow its installation
     instructions how to enable the plugin.

  3. If plugins are used, they should be temporarily deactivated to avoid
     disruptions during the upgrade process.

  4. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20211004:
  AFFECTS: users of www/py-pyjwt
  AUTHOR: rhurlin@FreeBSD.org

  To make it possible to easily import py-pyjwt v2.x the current port was
  moved to a versioned directory.

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -o www/py-pyjwt1 www/py-pyjwt
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fo www/py-pyjwt1 www/py-pyjwt
  If you use pkg with binary packages:
        pkg set -o www/py-pyjwt:www/py-pyjwt1

  AFFECTS: x11-wm/cage, x11-wm/hikari, x11-wm/labwc, x11-wm/sway, x11-wm/wayfire
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  SUID option has been removed in favor of seatd-launch(1) which doesn't
  require special handling in every consumer and doesn't bypass group
  permissions. If you've already enabled seatd service or use consolekit2
  then nothing changes. Otherwise,

    $ sway
    00:00:00.001 [ERROR] [wlr] [libseat] [libseat/libseat.c:83] No backend was able to open a seat
    00:00:00.001 [ERROR] [wlr] [backend/session/session.c:84] Unable to create seat: Function not implemented

  can be fixed by

    $ ck-launch-session sway

  or

    $ seatd-launch sway

  or

    # sysrc seatd_enable=YES
    # service seatd start
    $ sway

  Replace "sway" with your compositor e.g., "cage", "hikari", "labwc", "wayfire".

20210907:
  AFFECTS: consumers of math/eigen[23]
  AUTHOR: adridg@FreeBSD.org

  math/eigen2 has been marked deprecated. There do not seem to be any
  consumers in FreeBSD ports.

  math/eigen3 has had its options re-vamped. The default options previously
  pulled in multiple useless library dependencies. The options also forced
  a specific BLAS implementation. The new options depend only on the
  default BLAS (whatever USES=blaslapack picks), but this can be turned
  off. The previous multiple useless libraries -- which are not useless
  when running the tests in Eigen -- are now hidden behind the default-off
  TEST option.

  Users of a carefully-tuned Eigen build should re-evaluate the options
  available.

20210902:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The vim ports have been completely reworked to take advantage of flavors.

  The biggest change is that the `vim' package is now console-only. If
  you want the GTk3 GUI, you'll need to install the `vim-gtk3' package
  instead. All the GUI toolkits have their own package now: vim-gtk3,
  vim-gtk2, -athena, -motif, and -x11. The vim-tiny package still exists.

  Also: only python3 bindings are included now. There are very few plugins
  written in Perl or Ruby, so there really wasn't a need to bundle those
  languages with Vim. They still exist as OPTIONS, so you can still enable
  them if you'd like. Also, support for py27 has been dropped.

20210901:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/ampache
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  With the upgrade to Ampache 5.0.0, the root Ampache folder has changed
  to %%WWWDIR%%/ampache/public.  Please update your web server aliases,
  for example if you use Apache, then in httpd.conf make sure the lines
  look like this:

  Alias /ampache /usr/local/www/ampache/public

  <Directory "/usr/local/www/ampache/public">

  If you have customised your .htaccess files to allow for a different
  alias, you'll need to move them to the new location after upgrading:

  # sh -c 'cd /usr/local/www/ampache && for f in */.htaccess; do mv $f public/$f; done'

  More upgrade notes can be found on Github:

  https://github.com/ampache/ampache/releases/tag/5.0.0

20210823:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mu
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  mail/mu now uses XDG Base Directory Specification for the default
  locations for various files.  The mu database now lives under
  ~/.cache/mu rather than ~/.mu by default.  After upgrading,
  move the contents under ~/.mu to ~/.cache/mu.

20210823:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfixadmin
  AUTHOR: ports.maintainer@evilphi.com

  The 3.2->3.3 upgrade requires generating a new setup password hash.
  The normal post-upgrade visit to setup.php will walk you through the
  steps.

  https://github.com/postfixadmin/postfixadmin/blob/postfixadmin-3.3.9/CHANGELOG.TXT

20210818:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/redis port has been updated to the recent stable release.
  Users wanting to stay on v6.0 can replace databases/redis with
  databases/redis6 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install databases/redis6
    or
  # portmaster -o databases/redis6 databases/redis
    or
  # portupgrade -o databases/redis6 databases/redis

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/beats7
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  Beats may not be sending data to some distributions of Elasticsearch

  In this release, Elastic is enabling a licensing change that was broadly
  communicated earlier in 2021. This change would imply that 7.13 instances of
  Beats would fail to connect to 7.10 or earlier open source distributions of
  Elasticsearch and Kibana.

  The most visible effect is that sysutils/beats7 users can expect
  difficulties to send data to Elastic instances hosted in AWS.

  AFFECTS: users of x11/rxvt-unicode
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  Since 9.26, there is a regression in resource parsing, which no longer
  accepts a prefix of the form "URxvt*keysym" ("*." is equivalent to "*").

  Changing "*." to "." should make your bindings work again.

20210704:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/qtchooser
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  QtChooser allows you to select your version of Qt among those installed.
  However, this tool is no longer supported upstream and will not be
  available for Qt6.

  By default, our Qt installations are done in:
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/qt${QT_VERSION} as recommended.
  We have added symbolic linking for the main binaries to
  ${LOCALBASE}/bin with the suffix -qt5.

20210620:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab2
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The openhab v3 port has been committed. Upstream has removed the
  version from the name, as such the FreeBSD port follows in all places
  (start script name, directory names, ...).
  Users are encouraged to migrate from misc/openhab2 to misc/openhab.

  No automatic config migration is available Both versions can be
  installed in parallel, but an users has to take care to not run
  both at the same time on the same port.

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/mesa-libs and x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  Some libraries from mesa-libs are now provided by libglvnd while
  others were renamed. nvidia-driver already used libglvnd but bundled
  a copy which is now provided as a separate package. When building
  outside poudriere make sure to remove mesa-libs and nvidia-driver
  first in order to avoid conflict with libglvnd.

  For portmaster users:

  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v16.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. This is a major release, including many significant
  changes. Users are encouraged to read the release announcements before
  upgrading:

20210416:
  AFFECTS: Users of shells/bash, shells/bash-static with PORTS_READLINE=off
  AUTHOR: olce.freebsd@certner.fr

  Bundled readline now will use LOCALBASE/etc/inputrc as its ultimate default
  inputrc file (instead of /etc/inputrc). This puts these ports in line with
  what devel/readline has been doing recently (since 20210103).

20210414:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/OpenEXR or graphics/ilmbase
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  graphics/ilmbase was removed in favor of math/Imath 3.0.1,
  and graphics/OpenEXR was updated to 3.0.1. Ports that depend on
  OpenEXR and/or ilmbase according to INDEX were patched,
  for ports where OpenEXR is an option that defaults to off, these
  typical items needs to be changed - file bug reports in that case,
  preferably with tested patches:

  - The IlmBase parts Imath and half are now repackaged as Imath
  - The IlmThread and Iex libraries are now part of OpenEXR
  - Some header files were rearranged accordingly, into
    ${LOCALBASE}/include/OpenEXR vs. ${LOCALBASE}/include/Imath
  - Some code needs a few #include statements added, often
    #include <ImfHeader.h> or #include <ImfFrameBuffer.h>
  - Some classes were removed, and the C++11 standard library
    features need to be used, f. i. std::numeric_limits.
  - Some code used Int64 or SInt64 should use uint64_t or int64_t.

  Detailed porting hints are available here:

20210414:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fonts/oldschool-pc-fonts
  AUTHOR: evgeniy@khramtsov.org

  x11-fonts/oldschool-pc-fonts has been upgraded to 2.2. This version
  changed names of many fonts. If you have configuration files with
  specific font names set, you need to update your configurations
  after upgrade.

20210406:
  AFFECTS: users of www/phpvirtualbox
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  www/phpvirtualbox has been updated to version 6.1. This new version
  only supports version 6.1 of VirtualBox.

  Version 5.x of phpvirtualbox has been preserved as
  www/phpvirtualbox-legacy. If you require support for VirtualBox
  5.x please install this version. Remember to copy your configuration
  file in the new legacy installation.

20210328:
  AFFECTS: users of www/caddy
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The default locations for caddy runtime files have changed.

  - Caddy's runtime log is now /var/log/caddy/caddy.log
    (was /var/log/caddy.log)

  - Automatic SSL certs are now stored in /var/db/caddy/data/caddy
    (was /root/.local/share/caddy)

  - Configuration autosaves are now stored in /var/db/caddy/config/caddy
    (was /root/.config/caddy)

  You can change these defaults. See /usr/local/etc/rc.d/caddy for the
  list of settings.

20210322:
  AFFECTS: users of net/wireguard
  AUTHOR: decke@FreeBSD.org

  A wireguard kernel implementation supporting FreeBSD 12.1 and newer was
  added as net/wireguard-kmod recently.

  The new default for users of net/wireguard is the kernel module.

  If you experience problems with it you can switch back to wireguard-go
  by removing net/wireguard-kmod and making sure net/wireguard-go is
  installed.
  The userland tools wg-quick(8) and wg(8) try to use kernel support if
  the kernel module is available and otherwise fall back to wireguard-go
  automatically. Config files are fully compatible.

20210317:
  AFFECTS: users of security/strongswan
  AUTHOR: driesm@FreeBSD.org

  The stroke starter interface has been deprecated by upstream
  for some time now.  The default interface for controlling the charon
  daemon has switched from stroke to vici. Users still using the
  legacy config files such as ipsec.conf and ipsec.secret (stroke, starter)
  can easily revert to the old behavior by:

  # sysrc strongswan_interface="stroke"

  It is recommended to use the vici interface which is configured by swanctl.conf.
  Check : https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/Fromipsecconf
  to ease the transition from ipsec.* to swanctl.conf

20210313:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/phpipam
  AUTHOR: marko.cupac@mimar.rs

  ipaddresses table in phpipam database is likely to contain incorrect datetime
  values which prevent successful upgrade.  Make sure to create backup of
  phpipam database.  Before starting upgrade wizard in web interface run the
  following SQL query on phpipam database:

    UPDATE ipaddresses SET lastSeen='1970-01-01 00:00:01' WHERE lastSeen < '0000-01-01 00:00:00';

20210310:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/redisearch
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The textproc/redisearch port has been updated to the recent stable
  release - v2.0.  Users wanting to stay on v1.6 can replace
  textproc/redisearch with textproc/redisearch16 with one of the
  following commands:

  # pkg install textproc/redisearch16
    or
  # portmaster -o textproc/redisearch16 textproc/redisearch
    or
  # portupgrade -o textproc/redisearch16 textproc/redisearch

  NOTE: The textproc/redisearch16 brings a new name for the module,
  i.e. redisearch16.so, so be careful.

20210309:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/virtualbox-ose has been updated to 6.1.18. This new
  version only works on amd64 hardware.

  Previous version 5.x of the virtualbox ports have been preserved
  as emulators/virtualbox-ose-legacy and similarly named ports for
  the other parts.

  If you can't run the latest version or wish to stay with the old
  version, please install the legacy ports.

  Also the additions at present build successfully only for amd64.
  If you need i386 additions you can fallback to the old legacy
  ones.

  NOTE: There is no support for moving saved running machine states
  across major updates of virtualbox. It is recommended to properly
  shutdown all virtual machines before upgrading. Otherwise the saved
  state can simply be discarded after the upgrade, if it's not
  important to preserve it.

  It should also be possible to downgrade to the legacy ports and
  shutdown the machine properly from the saved state and then upgrade
  back again.

20210302:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs-devel
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  If you get the error "Symbol's value as variable is void: minor-modes",
  rebuild the offending Emacs packages.  See

20210220:
  AFFECTS: users of math/py-mathics
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  math/py-mathics has been split into several ports, and Mathics Core
  only provides a rudimentary command-line shell called mathics.
  To get the same functionality as in 1.x, you need to install either
  mathicsscript or Mathics-Django.

20210219:
  AFFECTS: users of games/mangband
  AUTHOR: adridg@FreeBSD.org

  The client has updated from 1.1.3 (which has a single public server
  left) to the current 1.5.3 (which has more public servers). If you
  update, you can NOT connect to the old server any more. Remember
  to finish your game before updating.

20210208:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailscanner
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  The clamavmodule has finally been removed after a long deprecation
  period.  Please remove all references to it in your mailscanner.conf as
  it will now count as a syntax error and may stop MailScanner starting!

20210204:
  AFFECTS: users of www/unit
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The default location for NGINX Unit's state directory has changed.  It
  was moved from /usr/local/libexec/unit to /var/db/unit in order to
  avoid write operations on /usr/local filesystem.

20210130:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/opencv-core
  AUTHOR: tcberner@FreeBSD.org

  graphics/opencv-core has been reintegrated into graphics/opencv.
  So there is no longer a circular dependency
     opencv-core -> ffmpeg -> opencv

  If you experience problems updating the packages, try
      pkg delete -f opencv-core

20210124:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  The Django templating language (DTL) is no longer supported for export
  templates.  Please ensure that all export templates use Jinja2 before
  upgrading.

  Also the support for embedded graphs was completely removed and several
  changes to the REST API were made.  Please check the changelogs for
  further details.

20210114:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/matterircd
  AUTHOR: norrland@nullbyte.se

  Commandline switches

  Switched to viper for cmdline parsing, which does not support "short" flags.
  You'll need to use --flag instead of -flag. Eg ./matterircd --debug
  Bridge specific configuration is now only in configuration file. This means
  the following flags have been removed: -restrict,-mmteam,-mmserver,
  -mminsecure,-mmskiptlsverify.
  You can set those in matterircd.toml, see the example file.

  Config changes

  BlacklistUser feature for slack has been renamed to DenyUsers.
  JoinMpImOnTalk feature has been renamed to JoinDM and is available for
  slack/mattermost
  JoinInclude, JoinExclude now support regexp (see matterircd.toml.example)

20210113:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis[-devel]
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/redis port has been updated to the recent stable release.
  Users wanting to stay on v5.x can replace databases/redis with
  databases/redis5 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install databases/redis5
    or
  # portmaster -o databases/redis5 databases/redis
    or
  # portupgrade -o databases/redis5 databases/redis

20210106:
  AFFECTS: mail/dovecot

20210102:
  AFFECTS: x11/libexo, XFCE4 desktop users
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  XFCE4 has been updated to version 4.16. Unluckily due to how the
  update works out it interacts badly with a defect in pkg which can
  cause files from the libexo package to be absent after upgrade.

  To avoid the issue, before upgrading all packages, please update
  libexo by itself:

  # pkg upgrade libexo
  # pkg upgrade

  If you have already upgraded and you notice XFCE issues due to
  missing libraries you can recover easily by forcing reinstallation
  of libexo:

  # pkg upgrade -f libexo

  Users upgrading via ports should not be affected.

20201228:
  AFFECTS: www/py-flexget
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  py-flexget (or py37-flexget) has been renamed to flexget.
  "pkg upgrade" doesn't track MOVED file unlike portmaster, so
  provide a hint e.g.,

    $ pkg upgrade -x flexget

  or install again, letting pkg remove the old version

    $ pkg install flexget

20201218:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.15.2.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

20201130:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/jpeg
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  The graphics/jpeg port has been removed in favor of graphics/jpeg-turbo.
  The former port was vulnerable and used an outdated ABI and API.

  Please check your make configuration for JPEG_PORT and remove it or
  set it to "jpeg-turbo" if it is currently set to "jpeg".

20201128:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/cego
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  Database updates from 2.45.x to 2.46.x require a xml tableset export
  and import, since table structure information has been changed.

20201128:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby26
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.6 to 2.7.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.6 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.6 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.6

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkg, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you do not use pkg, please check entry 20190420.
  The description there should also work for this version.

20201112:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/pushgateway
  AUTHOR: rhurlin@FreeBSD.org

  The v0.10.0 release changes the storage format. v0.10 can read the
  storage format of v0.5--v0.9. It will then persist the new format so
  that a downgrade won't be possible anymore [1].

  For later releases >= v1.0.0 only persistence files created by v0.10+
  are usable. So please, upgrade to v0.10 first to convert existing
  persistence files.

  It is intended to replace v0.10.0 in about four weeks from now (not
  before 2020-12-12) by >= v1.3.0.

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Changes related to the NetBox configuration:

  1. If in use, LDAP authentication must be enabled by setting
     REMOTE_AUTH_BACKEND to 'netbox.authentication.LDAPBackend'.  (The LDAP
     configuration parameters in ldap_config.py remain unchanged.)

  2. REMOTE_AUTH_DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS now takes a dictionary rather than a
     list.  This is a mapping of permission names to a dictionary of
     constraining attributes, or None.

     For example, ['dcim.add_site', 'dcim.change_site'] would become
     {'dcim.add_site': None, 'dcim.change_site': None}.

  3. Support for the DEFAULT_TIMEOUT parameter under REDIS database
     configuration was removed.  Set RQ_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT as a global
     configuration parameter instead.

  Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20201106:

  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The security/openvpn port has been updated to v2.5.0, which brings a
  change to the default ciphersuite, which no longer contains BF-CBC.

  Some options have been removed. Also, if you need to support very old (v2.3)
  and unsupported clients or servers, you will need to adjust the
  configuration. For details, see:

20201029:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v15.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node14, has been created for the
  v14.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v14.x can replace www/node
  with www/node14 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node14
    or

  AFFECTS: Users of mesa-dri with VAAPI or VDPAU options
  AUTHOR: manu@FreeBSD.org

  The nondefault options VAAPI and VDPAU were removed from the mesa-dri

  The default location for tenshi's configuration file has changed.  It was
  moved to /usr/local/etc/tenshi/tenshi.conf from /usr/local/etc/tenshi.conf
  in order to follow upstream defaults.

20201002:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail beginning with 6.4.12_1
  AUTHOR:  mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Note that if you are using fetchmail in a multi-user setup, i. e. with the
  fetchmail_users (mind the -s!) variable set, the $fetchmail_home_prefix +
  user second-guess work has been replaced by a real lookup of the user's home
  directory. In the majority of configurations, this should not make a
  difference, in some setups, it may open up some flexibility.

  The fetchmail_home_prefix variable is ignored from 6.4.12_1 onwards.

  Also, the rc script redirects its input from /dev/null so that passwords
  will not be interactively queried from an rcfile.  Put passwords into
  the [.]fetchmailrc or into a .netrc file.

20201002:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/modules
  AUTHOR: 0mp@FreeBSD.org

  The upstream developers of the Modules port encourage users to consult
  the MIGRATING document, which describes the major changes occurring between
  versions of Modules. It provides an overview of the new features and changed
  behaviors that will be encountered when upgrading:

20200930:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/syslog-ng32[789]
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  rc.conf variables syslog_ng_config and syslog_ng_pid have been replaced
  by syslog_ng_flags and syslog_ng_pidfile respectively, making them
  consistent with the rest of the ports tree. syslog_ng_config and
  syslog_ng_pid will continue to work until syslog-ng331 has been
  released and imported into ports.

20200924:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius3, who need python support
  AUTHOR: zi@FreeBSD.org

  FreeRADIUS 3.x currently uses python 2.7 for rlm_python support, which has
  been deprecated and will be removed from the tree at the end of this year.

  Starting in 3.0.21_2, the PYTHON option has been converted to use python 3.x.

  Users should verify their python scripts are 3.x compatible and upgrade to
  3.0.21_2 (or higher) to bring in python 3.x support.

20200921:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 11 to 12.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 11.9, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql11-server postgresql11-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql11-server-11.9.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql11-contrib-11.9.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib databases/postgresql11-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql12-server databases/postgresql12-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql12-server databases/postgresql12-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql12-server databases/postgresql12-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # su -l postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/initdb --encoding=utf-8 --lc-collate=C -D /var/db/postgres/data12 -U postgres"
  # su -l postgres -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /var/db/postgres/data11/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /var/db/postgres/data12/ -U postgres "

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  ATTENTION:
  1) The default user changed from "pgsql" to "postgres" in 11. The migration steps above now assume
     the "postgres" database user and FreeBSD user.
  2) See the updating entry 20190829 if you are updating from a release prior to 11.
  3) If you use non-default initdb options, you have to adjust the initdb-command accordingly

20200918:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/thunderbird
  AUTHOR: cmt@FreeBSD.org

  Thunderbird has been updated to the 78esr series. Thunderbird will
  try to convert old profiles on first start, but conversion may fail
  especially on old profiles. Also, older versions of Thunderbird will
  not be able to use a profile once it has been converted. It is
  strongly recommended to move any ~/.thunderbird folder away before
  starting Thunderbird 78 for the first time, thus creating a new and
  empty profile.
  Also note that OpenPGP functionality has been integrated into Thunderbird,
  obsoleting the Enigmail extension.
  Check https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP for details, and
  especially https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP:Smartcards
  if your private key lives on a smartcard.

20200914:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php72
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 7.2 to 7.4.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info php7\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php72 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php74.

20200811:
  AFFECTS: users of *-emacs26-* packages
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  With the release of Emacs version 27.1, the major version of editors/emacs has
  changed from 26 to 27.  This means the names of some dependent packages have
  also changed, so simply running `pkg upgrade` will not upgrade foo-emacs26-x
  to foo-emacs27-x.  To update these packages, run these commands with superuser
  privileges.

  Binary package users:

  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.32.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, follow the
  instructions in entry 20161103, it should still be the same.

  The imap module of PHP was compiled against cclient till now. But this lib is
  unmaintained for over 7 years. When combined with modern OpenSSL there are
  various crashes reported.

  Switching to the fork panda-cclient fixes these issues. Therefore we make the
  usage of Panda cclient the new default. If you want to use the old cclient,
  you need to enable it now!

  The www/baikal has been updated to 0.7.1. With the 0.7.0 release, our
  configuration format was updated to use YAML files. You need to go through
  the installer again but we pre-fill most values with the ones from your old
  installation. We recommend that you make a full backup of your data, as a
  safety measure. Starting with 0.7.0, Baikal stores data in both the Specific

20200531:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-policyd-spf-python
  AUTHOR:  yasu@utahime.org

  This port is now deprecated because upstream project is superseded by its
  successor. So uninstall this port and install mail/py-spf-engine instead.
  Keep in mind that the path of configuration file is changed from
  ${PREFIX}/etc/postfix-policyd-spf-python/policyd-spf.conf to
  ${PREFIX}/etc/python-policyd-spf/policyd-spf.conf. So you need to move
  it to new location unless you use the default one without changing.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/mariadb104-client, databases/mariadb104-server
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The ports now add sample configuration files to /usr/local/etc/mysql. You

  server configuration with conf.d/server.cnf.

20200518:
  AFFECTS: users of converters/libiconv
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  Support for the Japanese specific patches have been discontinued.
  These were previously added in a nondefault ports options, for people who

  Otherwise, SDDM will keep using /usr/local/etc/sddm/home/ as its HOME.

20200515:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libphutil, devel/arcanist-lib, devel/phabricator
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream fully deprecated devel/libphutil and merged its functionality
  into devel/arcanist-lib and devel/phabricator. As a result, the
  devel/libphutil port will be removed from the ports tree.

  After upgrading devel/(arcanist-lib|phabricator) to version 20200514, it is
  recommended to remove the orphaned libphutil package by running:

    # pkg delete php\*-libphutil

  Alternatively, 'pkg autoremove' will also work as expected, but might
  remove orphaned packages unrelated to this update.

  net/irrd has been upgraded to 4.X branch. If someone wants to stick with
  legacy version then pkg users have to do something like

  # pkg set -o net/irrd:net/irrd-legacy

  For portmaster users
  # portmaster -o net/irrd-legacy net/irrd

20200326:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/sonarqube and devel/sonar-ant-task
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The outdated port devel/sonarqube has moved to
  devel/sonarqube-community to make it clear that it is the community
  edition. The log and DB files are still stored in the same location.

  The devel/sonar-ant-task port has moved to devel/sonarqube-ant-task
  to match the upstream-name. The install location is renamed
  accordingly.

  At the same time the user/group of the sonarqube port changed from
  www:www to sonarqube:sonarqube.

  It is expected that nobody was using the 6.2 version from 2016
  anymore and no change needs to be done. No analysis was done to check
  if the old 6.2 version can be updated in-place to the 8.2 version.
  As such if there is still someone using the old 6.2 version, you may
  have to delete /var/log/sonarqube and /var/db/sonarqube before
  installing the new version.

20200320
  AFFECTS: users of devel/qca
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  New versions of devel/qca stopped supporting OpenSSL < 1.1.
  For this reason devel/qca-legacy has been added, which is
  held back at an older version until FreeBSD 11 goes EOL.

  Ports depending on devel/qca should stop adding direct LIB_DEPENDS
  and switch to depending on it via USES=qca.

  FreeBSD 11 users might want to run something like

      pkg set -o devel/qca:devel/qca-legacy

20200320:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/libxkbcommon
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The libxkbcommon library (x11/libxkbcommon), used to handle keyboards
  in some applications, most notably kde and wayland, have been switched
  to use evdev rules by default on FreeBSD 12 and later.  Some keys, most
  notably arrow keys, may not work in applications using libxkbcommon if
  you are using xf86-input-keyboard rather than xf86-input-libinput.
  If you have trouble with the keyboard keys, and if /var/log/Xorg.*.log
  shows that the "kbd" or "keyboard" driver is being used, you need to
  switch to legacy rules by setting the environment variable
  XKB_DEFAULT_RULES to xorg.
  This switch is made to match the default configuration on FreeBSD 12.1 and
  later, the default configuration on FreeBSD 11.3 still uses the legacy
  rules.

20200316:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/slack-term
  AUTHOR: dmgk@FreeBSD.org

  The config file location was changed from ~/.slack-term to
  ~/.config/slack-term/config, please move your existing config file
  accordingly.

20200308
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/mesa-libs and legacy graphics drivers
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The mesa OpenGL library (graphics/mesa-libs) has been switched to use DRI3
  by default, instead of the older DRI2 interface.  This might cause regressions
  when using the legacy graphics drivers, either through
  graphics/drm-legacy-kmod or the graphics drivers in base.

  If you experience issues when running OpenGL applications it is possible
  to force the use of DRI2 by setting the LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE environment
  variable to 1 before starting any OpenGL application.  The easiest way to
  do this is by adding it to either your shell startup files or .xinitrc.

20200306
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql80-server
  AUTHOR: joneum@FreeBSD.org

  As of MySQL 8.0.16, the MySQL server performs the upgrade tasks previously
  handled by mysql_upgrade. Consequently, mysql_upgrade is unneeded and is
  deprecated as of that version, and will be removed in a future MySQL version.
  Because mysql_upgrade no longer performs upgrade tasks,
  it exits with status 0 unconditionally.

20200303:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  1. Apache / mod_php options removed

  The APACHEMOD option has been removed. LibreNMS can be used
  with other webservers, not just Apache. In order to simplify
  the port, the option was removed.

  Now you manually install the webserver of your preference.

  If upgrading from LibreNMS < 1.61, you can do this to
  prevent 'pkg autoremove' from uninstalling Apache / mod_php:

  $ sudo pkg set -A 0 apache24 mod_php74
  Mark apache24-2.4.41 as not automatically installed? [y/N]: y
  Mark mod_php74-7.4.3 as not automatically installed? [y/N]: y

  Adjust mod_php74 to suit the version of mod_php you have.

  2. include/defaults.inc.php is gone

  The file include/defaults.inc.php is no longer distributed by
  the upstream project. The FreeBSD port patched this file to
  correct the paths to common tools such as ping, snmpwalk, etc.

  These values previously adjusted by the port must now be specified
  in config.php. New installs will have this automatically, but existing
  installs must be updated manually. These are the entries you should
  add if upgrading from LibreNMS < 1.61:

  $config['snmpwalk']       = '/usr/local/bin/snmpwalk';
  $config['snmpget']        = '/usr/local/bin/snmpget';
  $config['snmpbulkwalk']   = '/usr/local/bin/snmpbulkwalk';
  $config['snmptranslate']  = '/usr/local/bin/snmptranslate';

  $config['ping']           = '/sbin/ping';
  $config['mtr']            = '/usr/local/bin/mtr';
  $config['nmap']           = '/usr/local/bin/nmap';

  $config['nagios_plugins'] = '/usr/local/libexec/nagios';
  $config['ipmitool']       = '/usr/local/bin/ipmitool';
  $config['virsh']          = '/usr/local/bin/virsh';
  $config['dot']            = '/usr/local/bin/dot';
  $config['sfdp']           = '/usr/local/bin/sfdp';
  $config['nfdump']         = '/usr/local/bin/nfdump';

20200229:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/apache-solr

  Apache-solr switched to the supported java LTS version 11.
  Make sure you update the following files accordingly:
  /usr/local/etc/solr.in.sh (see /usr/local/etc/solr.in.sh.sample)
  /usr/local/etc/javavm_opts.conf (JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/openjdk11/)

20200225:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. Removal of the Topology Maps feature

  The deprecated topology maps feature has been removed.  Please replicate
  any required data to another source before upgrading NetBox to v2.7.7, as
  any existing topology maps will be deleted.


  2. Changed REDIS database configuration settings

  The REDIS database configuration parameters were splitted up in two
  discrete subsections named "webhooks" and "caching" with the 2.7 release.
  This requires modification of the REDIS parameter in configuration.py as
  follows:

  Old Redis sample configuration:

  REDIS = {
    'HOST': 'localhost',
    'PORT': 6379,
    'PASSWORD': '',
    'DATABASE': 0,
    'CACHE_DATABASE': 1,
    'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
    'SSL': False,
  }

  New Redis sample configuration:

  REDIS = {
    'webhooks': {
        'HOST': 'redis.example.com',
        'PORT': 1234,
        'PASSWORD': 'foobar',
        'DATABASE': 0,
        'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
        'SSL': False,
    },
    'caching': {
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': 6379,
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'DATABASE': 1,
        'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
        'SSL': False,
    }
  }

  Note that the CACHE_DATABASE parameter has been removed and the connection
  settings have been duplicated for both webhooks and caching.  This allows
  one to make use of separate Redis instances if desired.  It is fine to use
  the same Redis service for both functions, although the database
  identifiers should be different.

  Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20200223:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gsasl
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The library part of security/gsasl has been split into security/libgsasl.
  The security/gsasl now depends on security/libgsasl. Due to this change,
  old security/gsasl conflicts with the new security/libgsasl and it can
  prevent the installed security/gsasl from upgrading. Please remove the
  installed security/gsasl before upgrading if a conflict error occurs.

20200220:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  x11-servers/xorg-server has been updated to 1.20.7.

  With this update, xorg-server has switched from using the devd backend to
  the udev backend for device configuration on FreeBSD 12 and 13.  If you have
  issues with input devices, please see the install message for details.

  The HAL backend option has been completely removed, as it was deprecated.

  If you have problems with input devices, ensure that both x11/libinput and
  x11-drivers/xf86-input-libinput are installed.  They are installed in the
  default configuration, but if you have a custom configuration, they might not
  be.

20200210:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/prosody
  AUTHOR: thomas@beingboiled.info

  Prosody's pid file and data directory have moved to a new location.
  If you are upgrading from a version with the pid file and data
  directory in /usr/local/var/lib/prosody please perform these steps:

    # stop Prosody
    pkill -F /usr/local/var/lib/prosody/prosody.pid

    # copy the data directory
    cp -a /usr/local/var/lib/prosody /var/db/
    rm -f /var/db/prosody/prosody.pid

  Make sure your prosody config has the following option set:

    pidfile = "/var/run/prosody/prosody.pid"

  Then start Prosody again. Everything should be working as before and
  the /usr/local/var/lib/prosody directory can now be removed.

20200207:

  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The PYTHON2 and PYTHON3 options have been turned into a single PYTHON
  option that uses whichever python you've set as default. However,
  this means that you cannot have both python2 and python3 support at
  the same time.

20200126:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/gstreamer1-plugins[-bad]
  AUTHOR: kwm@freebsd.org

  In GStreamer 1.16 some files moved from the gstreamer1-plugins-bad package

  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  In the entry 20191216 for the Python update the filtering constrains
  are too limiting and omit the Samba supplimentary libraries, which do
  have Python bindings to the default Python 3.x version. With the update
  of the default Python3 version you also need to rebuild all the
  supplementary Samba libraries and samba410 itself.

  For portmaster users it would be enough to run:

20191126:
  AFFECTS: consumers of net/py-urllib3
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Since version 1.25 HTTPS connections are now verified by default which is
  done via "cert_reqs = 'CERT_REQUIRED'".  While certificate verification
  can be disabled via "cert_reqs = 'CERT_NONE'", it's highly recommended to
  leave it on.

  Various consumers of net/py-urllib3 already have implemented routines that
  either explicitly enable or disable HTTPS certificate verification (e.g.
  via configuration settings, CLI arguments, etc.).

  Yet it may happen that there are still some consumers which don't
  explicitly enable/disable certificate verification for HTTPS connections
  which could then lead to errors (as is often the case with self-signed
  certificates).

  In case of an error one should try first to temporarily disable
  certificate verification of the problematic urllib3 consumer to see if
  this approach will remedy the issue.

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Since the 2.6 release a running Redis server instance is required for
  caching objects to run.  Also the following settings like below need to be
  added (or modified) in the existing configuration.py:

  REDIS = {
    'HOST': 'localhost',
    'PORT': 6397,
    'PASSWORD': ''
    'DATABASE': 0,
    'CACHE_DATABASE': 1,
    'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
    'SSL': False,
  }

  Note that if you were using these settings in a prior release with
  webhooks, the DATABASE setting remains the same but an additional
  CACHE_DATABASE settings has been added with a default value of 1 to
  support the caching backend.

  The DATABASE setting will be renamed in a future release of NetBox to
  better relay the meaning of the setting.  It is highly recommended to keep
  the webhook and cache databases separate.  Using the same database number
  for both may result in webhook processing data being lost during cache
  flushing events.

  Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Make sure you upgrade your PostgreSQL to version 11 as described in 20190829,
  before you upgrade your gitlab-ce version.
  Gitlab-ce 12.1 needs at least PostgreSQL version 9.6.

  After this you can follow the usual upgrade guide:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/blob/master/update/12.0-12.1-freebsd.md

20190829:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 9.5 to 11.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 9.5.19, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql95-server postgresql95-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql95-server-9.5.19.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql95-contrib-9.5.19.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql95-server databases/postgresql95-contrib databases/postgresql95-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # su -l postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/initdb --encoding=utf-8 --lc-collate=C -D /var/db/postgres/data11 -U pgsql"
  # chown -R postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data/
  # su -l postgres -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /usr/local/pgsql/data/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /var/db/postgres/data11/ -U pgsql "

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  ATTENTION:
  1) The default user changed from "pgsql" to "postgres". The migration steps above preserve
     the "pgsql" database user while the database daemon is now executed as the "postgres" FreeBSD user.
  2) The default data dir changed from "/usr/local/pgsql/data/" to "/var/db/postgres/data11/"
  3) If you use non-default initdb options, you have to adjust the initdb-command accordingly

  Zetacoin will default to using modern versions of BDB (5.x or 6.x) when
  the WALLET option is selected.   See pkg-help for explanation.

  The zetacoin-nox11 slave port was renamed to zetacoin-daemon to align
  with the net-p2p/bitcoin format.

  The zetacoin-cli and zetacoin-tx utilities have been re-packaged into
  a separate port. If you require these programs, or use the zetacoin-cli
  program to access the daemon or the GUI, install net-p2p/zetacoin-utils
  to reinstall them.

20190710:
  AFFECTS: users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 or c6_64 in /etc/make.conf
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  On amd64 adding DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 to /etc/make.conf made Linux
  infrastructure ports (linux_base-c6 and linux-c6*) install i386 CentOS 6
  packages.  Using c6_64 instead of c6 made them install mixed amd64/i386
  CentOS 6 packages and allowed Linux application ports to install amd64
  binaries when available.  The i386-only configuration was only useful for
  users of x11/nvidia-driver* which didn't provide Linux amd64 emulation
  until recently.

  With x11/nvidia-driver* now supporting Linux amd64 there's no longer a
  need for i386-only Linux on amd64 so DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 has been
  changed to make Linux infrastructure ports install mixed amd64/i386
  CentOS 6 packages, like c6_64 before, and support for c6_64 has been
  removed.

  Users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 should reinstall linux_base-c6 and
  all packages that depend on it.  A list of dependent packages can be
  obtained with the following command:

    pkg info -r linux_base-c6

  Users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6_64 only need to replace c6_64 with
  c6 in /etc/make.conf.

  Users of x11/nvidia-driver* should upgrade to FreeBSD 11.3 or 12.0 if
  they want to run Linux amd64 OpenGL programs.  If you are running an
  older version you may want to postpone installing or updating Linux
  application ports until you find the time to upgrade because application
  ports may install amd64 binaries now.  Infrastructure ports are safe to
  reinstall, and so is x11/nvidia-driver*.

  On i386 nothing has changed.

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba410
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  If you used Samba in AD/DC mode with the previous versions of the port on UFS2
  backed storage you have to add usage of vfs_freebsd VFS module for at least
  SYSVOL share and configure it to use 'legacy' mode(see manpage).

  The reason behind this is that previous versions Samba port used a hack to
  workaround broken mapping of Linux security and trusted extended attributes
  into FreeBSD namespace. In particular, essential security.NTACL attribute
  was replaced with the user.NTACL and placed in a insecure USER namespace.

  This port dropped this hack in favor of vfs_freebsd module, which should
  provide more controlled way of such a mapping.

  To maintain the compatibility with the previous installations on UFS2 storage
  (as ZFS uses it's own way of mapping SYSVOL, thanks to the iXsystems patches)
  the vfs_freebsd module provides 'legacy' mode that implements old functionality.

  For the fresh installations it is recommended to use 'secure' mode of operations
  for this module and use it as a global vfs objects.

  Caution: The given module is still considered EXPERIMENTAL.

  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  The port of the new version of Samba 4.10 is introduced. Due necessarily
  to keep backwards compatibility for the legacy samba4[6-8] ports the
  upgrade procedure is a bit convoluted.

  You are safe to perform fresh new install of samba410 port. In case you
  are upgrading from the previous versions of Samba, please use the
  following procedure:

  0.  Take backups of all the relevant files, in particular PREFIX/etc/smb4.conf
      and /var/db/samba4/ subdirectory. Keep in mind that files there (may)
      have extended attributes, so use appropriate tools to preserve them.

  1a. If you haven't updated Samba between 20190619 and 20190630 then next
      step should be as simple as:

        portmaster -o net/samba410 net/samba48

  1b. If you have been affected by the archiving legacy versions of
      Samba-related libraries for legacy versions of Samba, which happened
      in the given time frame, then you need to reverse operation from the
       20190619 entry:

      for users of portmaster:
        portmaster -o devel/talloc devel/talloc1

  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  To introduce samba410(we deliberately skip samba49 due the complexity of handling)
  and to drop dependency on deprecated Python 2.7, Samba supplementary libraries
  talloc, tevent and tdb were split into current Python 3 compatible versions
  and legacy ones, with the suffix "1".

  Old versions of Samba were changed to depend on the legacy supplementary libraries,
  so if you need to install samba46, samba47 or samba48 over previous Samba
  installations you need to downgrade supplementary libs with the following commands:

  for users of portmaster:
        portmaster -o devel/talloc1 devel/talloc
        portmaster -o devel/tevent1 devel/tevent
        portmaster -o databases/tdb1 databases/tdb

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

  AFFECTS: users of net/routinator
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@FreeBSD.org

  Release 0.4.0 fundamentally changes the command line options for
  running the server and introduces a new way to initialize the local RPKI
  repository used by Routinator.
  If you have been using previous releases, you will likely have to adjust
  your tooling. We apologize for this, but we also feel that the new commands
  are more intuitive and logical.

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba47
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of samba has been switched from 4.7 to 4.8.
  Upgrade instructions:

  For package users having samba47 installed indirectly (as a dependency):
    # pkg upgrade

  For package users having samba47 installed directly (leaf port):
    # pkg upgrade
    # pkg install samba48

  For ports users:
    If you want to keep samba47, add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= samba=4.7 to make.conf

    If you want to upgrade to samba48, remove samba47:
    # pkg delete -f samba47

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster net/samba48
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall net/samba48
    # portupgrade -a

  will be required if intl extension isn't already loaded.

20190522:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/graylog
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.0.2, which
  includes more plugins by default, but also requires manual changes to
  graylog's configuration files, possibly port and URL changes, such as
  X-Graylog-Server-URL settings, and elasticsearch must be >= 5.

  The location of configuration files has been amended to align with the
  official distribution files and locations.

  After upgrading, manually review and merge changes from your
  /usr/local/etc/graylog/server/server.conf into
  /usr/local/etc/graylog/graylog.conf

  Consult https://www.graylog.org/post/announcing-graylog-v3-0-ga for
  further details.

20190506:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitea
  AUTHOR: stb@lassitu.de

  Gitea requires the addition of another secret to the config file in order
  to start up.  Either manually add JWT_SECRET to the
  ${PREFIX}/etc/gitea/conf/app.ini config file (see app.ini.sample), or allow
  Gitea to make the change for you by making the config file writable to the
  git user.

  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v12.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. This is a major release, including many significant
  changes. Users are encouraged to read the release announcements before
  upgrading:

  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.0.0/

20190423:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The directory where all repositories and ssh permissions are stored
  was changed from /usr/home/git back to /usr/local/git, to match again the
  recommended standards on FreeBSD.
  This will cause now some other git management packages to collide with
  gitlab. Make sure you migrate all you git repositories to gitlab first,
  before you continue.

  Make sure /usr/local/git/repositories and /usr/local/git/.ssh are not
  existing!
  Otherwise the next commands can break your installation for managing
  git repositories within gitlab and with your other gitlab management
  software!

  You must move the old files to the new location with:
  # service gitlab stop
  # mv /usr/home/git /usr/local/
  # pkg upg

  Make sure you update your config files, diff shows you what you maybe
  must change:
  # cd /usr/local/www/gitlab-ce
  # git diff config/gitlab.yml.sample config/gitlab.yml
  # cd /usr/local/share/gitlab-shell/
  # git diff config.yml.sample config.yml
  # cd /usr/local/share/gitaly
  # git diff config.toml.sample config.toml

  # Change home directory of user git back to /usr/local/git
  # vipw
  The line should now looks like:
  git:*:211:211::0:0:gitosis user:/usr/local/git:/bin/sh

  If you do an upgrade of gitlab follow the upgrade guide.
  If not, just start gitlab again with:
  # service gitlab start

20190422:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.9 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20190421:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/cego
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  To upgrade from cego 2.39.16 to 2.44.1, you need to export to xml before
  the upgrade and import from xml after the upgrade, because the internal
  storage has changed for some types.

  Use these steps:

  - export your database while it runs, see
    http://www.lemke-it.com/litexec?request=pubcegodoc&user=&lang=en&section=cgdoc_database_running.html#tsimpexp_mode
    for details.
  - stop the database
    service cego stop
  - upgrade the port/package
  - re-create the database
    cego --mode=create --tableset=<database> --dbxml=<database>.xml
  - import the database
    cego --mode=xmlimport --tableset=<database> \
	--dbxml=<database>.xml --impfile=export.xml --doLogging
  - modify /etc/rc.conf by adding
    cego_<database>_cpdump="YES"
    cego_<database>_cleanup="YES"
  - start the database
    service cego start

20190420:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby24
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.4 to 2.5.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.4 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.4 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.4

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby25 lang/ruby24
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.5

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby24:lang/ruby25
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.5.\* -fr lang/ruby25

  AUTHOR: meta@FreeBSD.org

  These ports' bridge, client, server daemon unintendedly had spit out
  chain_certs (certificate chain) directory on libexec directory until
  r494024.

  If your ${PREFIX}/libexec/softether/chain_certs directory is empty, you
  can remove the directory safely. If the directory is not empty, move it
  to ${SE_DBDIR} when upgrading softether. Following commands should help:

      service softether_(bridge|client|server) stop
      (portmaster, portupgrade or pkg upgrade)
      mv ${PREFIX}/libexec/softether/chain_certs ${SE_DBDIR}/

  which results in invalid XML, and causing XMPP clients to disconnect.  For more
  details, please refer to: https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/issues/2744

  This upgrade contains the patch that fixes the problem going forward. For fixing already
  affected users, you'll need to wipe off the MAM cache for the affected users:

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/mk-livestatus
  AUTHOR: egypcio@FreeBSD.org

  The default Nagios version supported by net-mgmt/mk-livestatus changed
  from Nagios 3 to Nagios 4 - the respective Nagios package was added to
  net-mgmt/mk-livestatus' runtime dependencies.

  If you still need support for Nagios 3 you just need to change the
  options for net-mgmt/mk-livestatus and compile the port yourself.

20190202:
  AFFECTS: users of archivers/urbackup-server
  AUTHOR: freebsd@coombscloud.com

  Some of the port's sources previously included absolute references to /etc/urbackup.
  The upgrade now changes these references to ${PREFIX}/etc/urbackup.  If you have

  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The fluentd port has been upgraded from the 0.12 line to 1.3.3.  The upgrade
  is mostly non-disruptive since there is a backward compatibility with 0.12
  plugins and configuration files, but care should be taken about the order of
  server upgrades since fluentd 1.x is unable to send it's data to version 0.12
  instances.  You should carefully read

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/qgis
  AUTHOR: rhurlin@gwdg.de

  GIS 3.4 LTR, the first long-term release (LTR) of QGIS 3, has landed
  in the FreeBSD ports tree. It will also replace the previous 2.18 LTR
  in the QGIS package repositories in February 2019 [1].

  Beside, the latest Qt4 version 4.8.7 has been EOL since December 2015
  and its expiration date on FreeBSD is set to March, 15th 2019.
  Because QGIS 2 is based on Qt4 and Python2, it was decided to not create
  a legacy port for QGIS 2, after graphics/qgis changed to QGIS 3.

  For users moving over from the 2.18 LTR there is a huge list of new
  features and impactful changes in this new 3.4 LTR version. Most notably
  3.x plugins are incompatible with 2.x plugins, so please review your
  plugin usage carefully. Before moving over, if you have not already
  done so, take a look at the changelogs from versions 3.0, 3.2, and
  3.4 [2][3][4] to understand the full scope of changes in the 3.x release.

  AFFECTS: users of net/GeoIP
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Maxmind no longer provides geolocation data in the legacy format used
  by net/GeoIP. All GEOIP-related OPTIONS have been removed, and all
  GeoIP-dependent ports will be removed soon.

  Where possible, you must switch to net/libmaxminddb, which uses the
  newer (and fully supported) GeoIP 2 format. Unfortunately, this is
  not a drop-in replacement. To fetch the GeoIP 2 geolocation databases,
  whether the free or paid versions, you must use net/geoipupdate
  (pkg install geoipupdate).

  The legacy database is no longer available, and we cannot distribute
  it by the Maxmind license, so the legacy GeoIP format is essentially
  dead.

20190108:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql-connector-java
  AUTHOR: matthew@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/mysql-connector-java port has been updated to 8.0.13,
  which requires a minimum of Java 1.8, so dropping support for Java
  1.6 and 1.7.  Users of those versions of Java should substitute the
  databases/mysql-connector-java51 port which remains at version
  5.1.47

20190103:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/vlc*

  The multimedia/vlc port has been upgraded to 3.0.5, the latest upstream
  release. Subsequently, multimedia/vlc-qt4 and multimedia/vlc3 have been
  retired and removed from the ports tree. Users who previously used
  multimedia/vlc3 might want to switch to multimedia/vlc with the following
  commands:

  # pkg install multimedia/vlc
    or
  # portmaster -o multimedia/vlc multimedia/vlc3

  AFFECTS: users of devel/trio
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@freebsd.org

  Since trio 1.16-1, the shared lib previously misnamed libtrio.so.2.0.0
  is now named libtrio.so.2 and the symlink libtrio.so is created.

20181222:
  AFFECTS: users of net/ntopng
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Since ntopng 3.7, for security reasons, the default setting for
  the data directory has been changed to "/var/db/ntopng", and the
  default user has been changed to "ntopng". This new directory is
  created automatically by the port/package with correct permissions.

  In order to maintain backward compatibility, if you are already
  using "/var/tmp/ntopng" as data directory, ntopng keeps using that
  folder, owned by "nobody". This said, using the old defaults is not
  recommended and a manual action is required in order to migrate to
  the new settings, unless you are already using a custom directory:

  # service ntopng stop
  # mv /var/tmp/ntopng/* /var/db/ntopng/
  # chown -R ntopng:ntopng /var/db/ntopng
  # service ntopng start

  Please check the upstream FAQ for reference:

  The newsyslog.conf(5) filename installed by the port has been changed:
  OLD: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/${PORTNAME}
  NEW: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/${PORTNAME}.conf

  Any file found at the old location will be automatically moved to the new
  location. This will ensure log rotation will continue to work after change
  r340318 to FreeBSD base, where the default newsyslog configuration now only
  includes filenames that end with '.conf' and do not begin with '.'.

  If you use provisioning/configuration management tools to create or edit this

  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.8 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling

  recent versions, the following steps are required.

  You must update config.php and manually relocate the rrd and log files.
  Before upgrading, please stop librenms,  update the configuration, and
  relocate the files.

  If you find graphs are not updating, fping >= 4.0 requires an IPv6
  address. Adding an IPv6 address should fix graphing.

  Please add these entries to config.php:

  $config['installed_from_package'] = true;
  $config['log_dir'] = '/var/log/librenms';
  $config['rrd_dir'] = '/var/db/librenms/rrd';

  To relocate the files:

  mkdir /var/log/librenms /var/db/librenms
  chown www:ww: /var/log/librenms /var/db/librenms
  cd /usr/local/www/librenms
  mv rrd /var/db/librenms/
  mv logs/librenms.log /var/log/librenms/
  rmdir logs

  An application key is required. Please follow these steps to generate it:

  cd /usr/local/www/librenms
  cp -i .env.sample .env

  You might need to set your database details in that file.
  Then run:

  php artisan key:generate

  The output should look something like this:

  AFFECTS: users of dns/dnsdist
  AUTHOR: cpm@FreeBSD.org

  After discussing with several users, we noticed that quite a lot of them
  were not aware that enabling the dnsdist's console without a key, even
  restricted to the local host, could be a security issue and allow privilege
  escalation by allowing an unprivileged user to connect to the console and
  execute Lua code as the dnsdist user. We therefore decided to refuse any
  connection to the console until a key has been set, so please check that
  you do set a key before upgrading if you use the console.

20180704:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The gitlab port uses the package from gitlab.org instead of github.org.
  For this the port was renamed from gitlab to gitlab-ce.
  Please follow the instructions very carefully to not lose your data!
  Not only the package was renamed, also the directory name changed.

  You can find the current instruction here:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/blob/master/update/10.8-11.0-freebsd.md

  Please note the update was only tested for an update from 10.8.5 to 11.0.2.

  # pkg install emacs-devel-nox

  pkg should remove the old and install the new package.

20180612:
  AFFECTS: users of packages that depend on Emacs
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  With the release of Emacs version 26.1, the major version of editors/emacs
  changed from 25 to 26, so the names of packages that depend on Emacs have also
  changed.  For example, pdf-tools-emacs25-0.80.79_1 is now called
  pdf-tools-emacs26-0.80.79_1.  The name change means simply running `pkg
  upgrade` will not upgrade foo-emacs25-x to foo-emacs26-x.

  To list the packages to upgrade, use

  # pkg info \*emacs25\*

  then install the new version for each with

  # pkg install foo-emacs26

  pkg should remove the old and install the new packages.

20180611:
  AFFECTS: users of PHP based applications
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Flavors are being added to PHP applications.  When a port is flavorized, pkg
  needs to be told about the name change, for example, if PHP 5.6 is the one
  you need:

  # pkg set -n squirrelmail:squirrelmail-php56

  Most port will have packages for all PHP versions present in the ports tree,
  but some may not be compatible with a specific version.

  To get the available flavors, pkg rquery can be used:

  # pkg rquery %n mail/squirrelmail
  squirrelmail-php56
  squirrelmail-php70
  squirrelmail-php71
  squirrelmail-php72

    policy section of the zrepl configuration file (source side only).
    Be sure to understand the meaning bookmarks have for maximum
    allowable replication downtime.
  - The ssh+stdinserver transport protocol has changed, requiring zrepl
    to be updates on both the sending and receiving side, and the daemon
    restarted on both sides.
  - The first outlet in the global.logging section of the configuration

  If you use any of the optional make.conf variables to specify the
  postgrey user, group, db dir, or run dir when building the port, you will
  need to change the prefix from PG_ to POSTGREY_*.  The variables were
  renamed to solve a namespace collision with the PostgreSQL ports.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/php-composer
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Flavors have been added to the composer port with the update to
  1.6.3. Due to the change in PKGNAME pkg(and other tools) will not
  notice the update. It is required to tell pkg about the name
  change, for example:

  # pkg set -n php-composer:php56-composer

20180410:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Most of KDE Applications 17.12.3 have now landed in the ports tree.
  There are still some missing pieces, that will follow soon.

  As mentioned in the commit messages, users of KDE SC4 should stick with the
  <foo>-kde4 named package.

  As the MOVED entries for ports like databases/akonadi-kde4 have been removed
  in the process of updating (as there now is again a databases/akonad), there
  might be issues for people that update from a too old installed package list
  with portmaster.

  These should be fixable by issuing a command à la
  # pkg set --change-origin databases/akonadi:databases/akonadi-kde4 akonadi

20180409:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/matterircd
  AUTHOR: norrland@nullbyte.se

  Matterircd has been updated to 0.17.0 and mattermost configuration settings
  need to be migrated to [mattermost] section. See matterircd.toml.sample.

  AFFECTS: users of www/nextcloud
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  With the 13.0.1 update the path for Apps bundled with the package has
  changed from "apps" to "apps-pkg". You must add an entry to the
  "apps_paths" array in config/config.php of your nextcloud installation,
  a patch for the default installation can be applied with:

  # cd /usr/local/www/nextcloud
  # su -m www -c "php ./occ config:import < /usr/local/share/nextcloud/fix-apps_paths.json"

20180401:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot and mail/dovecot-pigeonhole
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Dovecot has been upgraded to 2.3.1, and pigeonhole to 0.5.1. Most
  existing dovecot installations MUST be modified for 2.3, but for
  most users the modifications are simple.

  Modify your Dovecot conf.d/ files before spinning up 2.3.1. The
  upgrading instructions are detailed here:

20180330:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.26.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, follow the
  instructions in entry 20161103, it should still be the same.

20180325:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba48
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  New Samba 4.8 upgrades the relevant database files in the way, that doesn't
  allow easy fallback to the previous versions of Samba. So, before upgrading
  to the new version make a backup of the /var/db/samba4/ directory.

  Full list of changes, new features and upgrade procedure is available at:

        https://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.8.0.html

  Please, read it carefully before upgrading!.

  AFFECTS: users of x11/sterm
  AUTHOR: pkubaj@anongoth.pl

  The user-defined options in config.h have changed.  You should
  compare your config.h file with the default one and change
  appropriately.

20180319:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/dnsmasq
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Note that with dnsmasq 2.79, some parts of the interface have changed in an
  incompatible way versus previous versions. This comprises changed recursion
  behaviour, signature support, a change for SIGINT (vs. SIGHUP) behaviour.

  Note especially that dnsmasq will no longer answer non-recursive queries
  unless it is marked authoritative!  Be sure to see the manual page for the
  various --auth-* options, such as --auth-zone.

  Please see the CHANGELOG that ships with dnsmasq for details.

20180317:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/plexpy
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  Plexpy project has been renamed to Tautulli due to copyright
  infringement. The software also has received a major update. Please
  see the following upgrade instructions:

  - Install multimedia/tautulli
  - Create /var/db/tautulli, owned by the user you will run the daemon as
    (default: nobody).
  - Copy your config.ini and plexpy.db to /var/db/tautulli
  - Enable the service and start the software

   Tautulli should automatically find your database file, rename it to
   tautulli.db, and perform the required updates.

20180310:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The EXPCIPHERS option has been removed from the security/openssl port.
  Use the security/openssl-unsafe port if you require this feature.

20180309:
  AFFECTS: users of net/unison
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Unison has been upgraded to version 2.51, which uses a different
  wire protocol than 2.48 did.  In order to support synchronization
  with other computers where Unison is still at version 2.48, a new
  port net/unison248 has been created.  It provides unison248 and,
  for the x11 flavor, also unison248-text.  This unison248 port can
  be installed in parallel with the existing net/unison port.

20180308:
  AFFECTS: */php* */pecl* */pear*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  PHP extensions and modules have been flavored.

  People using Poudriere 3.2+ and binary packages do not have to do anything if
  they are using PHP applications.

  PHP modules and extensions may have change their names from php5- or php7- to
  fully versionned phpXY-.
  PECL extensions and PEAR modules package names have changed from pecl- and
  pear- to phpXX-pecl and phpXX-pear-.

  To rename an installed package to match the new naming scheme, for example,
  for the imagick pecl extension, run:

    # pkg set -n pecl-imagick:php56-pecl-imagick

  For other people, to build the PHP 7.2 version of, for example,
  databases/php-memcached, you need to run:

    # make FLAVOR=php72 install

20180220:
  AFFECTS: users of www/nextcloud
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The file and directory permissions of Nextcloud have changed. Write
  permissions have been removed from all directories except `data' and
  `config'. For the updater to work, the app store of your installation
  must be disabled. To disable the app-store prior to updating the
  package:

  # cd /usr/local/www/nextcloud
  # su -m www -c "php ./occ config:system:set appstoreenabled --value=false --type=boolean"

  If you've already updated your nextcloud package, you must manually edit
  the configuration of nextcloud (config/config.php) and add

  	'appstoreenabled' => false,

  to the CONFIG array before the updater will run.

20180214:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby23
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.3 to 2.4.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.3 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.3 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.3

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby24 lang/ruby23
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.4

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby23:lang/ruby24
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.4.\* -fr lang/ruby24

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/pmacct
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  To allow separate pmacctd instances per interface, use

    pmacctd_enable="YES"
    pmacctd_interfaces="re1 re2"

  in /etc/rc.conf. The path to the config files will be

    /usr/local/etc/pmacct/<interface>

20180208:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailman*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  In order to overcome complaints about mismatched checksums in
  Mailman/Default.py, mailman now configures the DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST
  and DEFAULT_URL_HOST to "localhost" statically, and the rc script
  will check this and refuse to start on next boot.

  Users must configure DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST and DEFAULT_URL_HOST in
  Mailman/mm_cfg.py properly and add this line below:
  add_virtualhost(DEFAULT_URL_HOST, DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST)

  A short example has been added to:
  ${PREFIX}/local/share/doc/mailman/FreeBSD-post-install-notes.

  As of 2.1.26_3, the post-install script will add back the prior
  default settings to mm_cfg.py (instead of Defaults.py) if no
  virtual hosts have been defined, to cover the normal use cases
  and initial installation.

20180201:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs* and all ports using Emacs via USES=emacs
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  The Emacs ports framework has been updated to support flavors and the
  editors/emacs-nox11 port has been replaced by the nox flavors of
  editors/emacs and editors/emacs-devel.

  Supported Flavors
  --------------------------------------------------------
  editors/emacs:       full canna nox
  editors/emacs-devel: full nox
  ports using Emacs:   full canna nox devel_full devel_nox
  --------------------------------------------------------

  For those using pre-built packages, if

     # pkg upgrade

  does not install the new Emacs package, use one of

     # pkg install emacs
     # pkg install emacs-canna
     # pkg install emacs-nox
     # pkg install emacs-devel
     # pkg install emacs-devel-nox

  For those building their own packages, a flavor other than the default must be
  specified.  For example, to build the nox flavor of editors/emacs, or to build
  the devel_full flavor of a port using Emacs, use

     # poudriere bulk -j 11amd64 editors/emacs@nox
     # poudriere bulk -j 11amd64 print/pdf-tools@devel_full

  or

     # make FLAVOR=nox install
     # make FLAVOR=devel_full

  An alternative to the default flavor, full, for editors/emacs and
  editors/emacs-devel can be set in make.conf.  For example, to specify nox as
  the default flavor for both ports, use

     .if ${.CURDIR:M*/editors/emacs*}
     FLAVOR?=nox
     .endif

  For ports using Emacs, an alternative to the default flavor, full,
  can be also be set in make.conf.  For example, to automatically depend on
  emacs-nox, use

     DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=emacs=nox

20180117:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/kf5-kirigami2 and x11/kf5-plasma-framework
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Files that were previously installed by kf5-kirigami2 are now installed
  by kf5-plasma-framework. This can lead to a conflict during the upgrade
  of the packages.
  It is recommended to first remove the package kf5-kirigami2.

20180115:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/transmission-daemon
  AUTHOR: woodsb02@FreeBSD.org

  The transmission-daemon port has been updated to 2.92_4 to incorporate
  a patch which mitigates DNS rebinding attacks. This will prevent
  clients from being able to connect to the transmission daemon using
  DNS with any hostname other than localhost, unless one of the
  following is done:
    - Enable password authentication, then any hostname is allowed.
      This can be achieved by either:
        - setting rpc-authentication-required to true, and adding
          credentials to the rpc-username and rpc-password fields in
          settings.json (must be done whilst the transmission service is
          stopped); or
        - running transmission-daemon with the following arguments
          (these can be set with transmission_flags in /etc/rc.conf):
          -t -u USERNAME -v PASSWORD
    OR
    - Add the allowed server hostnames to the rpc-host-whitelist setting
      in settings.json (must be done whilst the transmission service is
      stopped). Note that this value is NOT a list of allowed CLIENTS,
      but instead a list of allowed SERVER hostnames.

20180111:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim-lite
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The vim-lite port has been renamed to vim-console, because it isn't
  actually any lighter. All three vim packages are built with
  --enable-features=huge. Portmaster users will need to run this
  command:

  	portmaster -o editors/vim-console editors/vim-lite

  If the switch doesn't happen automatically for you, just delete the
  vim-lite package and install vim-console.

20180109:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The upgrade of www/qt5-webengine to 5.9.3 may fail if an older version
  of it is installed. It is recommended to either build the port in a
  builder like poudriere, or to deinstall and then doing an install.

20180107:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnupg and mail/mutt and mail/neomutt
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The invocation for gpg from mutt/neomutt changed between gnupg-2.0
  (which has expired and is now removed) and gnupg-2.2 (the current
  version in the tree). Unless you're using gpgme, PGP-related
  commands may fail in (neo)mutt.

  In all cases, users are strongly urged to use security/gpgme to take
  care of the setup for you. If you prefer to roll your own, the
  following muttrc/neomuttrc entry has been reported to work:

  pgp_decrypt_command="gpg2 %?p?--passphrase-fd 0 --pinentry-mode=loopback? --no-verbose --batch --output - %f"

  See muttrc(5), neomuttrc(5), mutt.org, and neomutt.org for instructions
  on (neo)mutt's gpg and gpgme instructions.

20180102:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/awscli
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The package name for devel/awscli has changed (back) to just awscli.
  The introduction of flavors erroneously caused the awscli package to
  be renamed to py27-awscli.

20171230:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  If you are building ejabberd 17.11 on a host, which already has an older
  version of ejabberd installed, then build process will fail with "unknown type
  specifier" errors. As a workaround, please uninstall ejabberd before building
  ejabberd.

  This has been reported upstream at:
  https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/issues/2194

20171223:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/dnscrypt-proxy
  AUTHOR: egypcio@googlemail.com

  The 1.9.5_3 update of dns/dnscrypt-proxy replaces the default resolver used
  by dnscrypt-proxy (cisco/OpenDNS) by a random one that does not log entries
  and supports dnssec.

20171223:
  AFFECTS: users of samba44
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of samba has been switched from 4.4 to 4.6.
  Upgrade instructions:

  For package users having samba44 installed indirectly (as a dependency):
    # pkg upgrade

  For package users having samba44 installed directly (leaf port):
    # pkg upgrade
    # pkg install samba46

  For ports users:
    If you want to keep samba44, add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= samba=4.4 to make.conf

    If you want to upgrade to samba46, remove samba44:
    # pkg delete -f samba44

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster net/samba46
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall net/samba46
    # portupgrade -a

20171218:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gogs
  AUTHOR: dg@syrec.org

  Gogs user has been changed to "git" and configuration files are now
  located in /usr/local/etc/gogs. Users should update ownership of the
  existing Gogs directories with

  # chown -R git:git /var/db/gogs
  # chown -R git:git /var/log/gogs

  and either move or merge the contents of /var/db/gogs/home/.ssh with
  /usr/local/git/.ssh.  After migration, /var/db/gogs/home can be removed,
  and both the user "gogs" and the group "gogs" should be deleted:

  # rm -rf /var/db/gogs/home
  # pw userdel gogs
  # pw groupdel gogs

20171215:
  AFFECTS: users of finance/gnucash
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The gnucash port has been converted too use flavors, the GUILE1
  and GUILE2 options have been converted to flavors so that two
  separate packages can be provided.

  Since the next major release of gnucash will drop guile1 support,
  the default flavor package is compiled against guile2, switching
  the previous default.

  Users who intend to stay on the guile1 version should deinstall
  the default gnucash package and install the gnucash-guile1 package.

20171214:
  AFFECTS: all ports users
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Support for some deprecated variables is going to be removed soon. If
  you use any of the following constructs (usually in /etc/make.conf),
  you must switch to the new incantations:

20171205:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/powerdns
  AUTHOR: krion@FreeBSD.org

  Recursor passthrough removal: This will impact many installations.
  Previously, the PowerDNS Authoritative Server contained a facility
  for sending recursion desired queries to a resolving backend,
  possibly after first consulting its local cache. This feature
  (‘recursor=’) was frequently confusing and also delivered
  inconsistent results, for example when a query ended up referring
  to a CNAME that was outside of the Authoritative Server’s
  knowledge.

20171203:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/dsbmd
  AUTHOR: mk@freeshell.de

  Due to new configuration variables and new features, users of dsbmd
  version 0.4.1 and earlier should consider recreating their dsbmd.conf from
  the new dsbmd.conf.sample.

20171130:
  AFFECTS: all ports users
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The ports tree has gained "flavors," which are a way to produce multiple
  variations of a port. Some intended examples of this are language
  modules being produced for multiple language versions, and lite/nox11 packages,
  without needing separate ports for each variation. Python ports have already
  been flavored (see the below entry). Flavor support must be added to
  individual ports.

  Flavors are already supported by make, pkg, poudriere, and synth; see the
  manpages for those tools for usage instructions. Portmaster and portupgrade
  don't support flavors yet, but community work on those tools is in progress.

  Some bumps and breakages are inevitable for a major change such as this.
  Please report breakages and monitor the ports@ list for solutions as they
  become available.

20171130:
  AFFECTS: */py*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Ports using Python via USES=python are now flavored.  All the py3-* ports
  have been removed and folded into their py-* master ports.

  People using Poudriere 3.2+ and binary packages do not have to do anything.

  For other people, to build the Python 3.6 version of, for example,
  databases/py-gdbm, you need to run:

    # make FLAVOR=py36 install

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/zrepl
  AUTHOR: woodsb02@FreeBSD.org

  Zrepl has been updated to 0.0.2, which introduces two changes that will
  require existing users to change their zrepl.yml config file:
    - global.logging is no longer a dictionary but a list.
      Refer to the new format here: https://zrepl.github.io/configuration/logging.html
    - source job field datasets renamed to filesystems.

20171114:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/poudriere
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  "poudriere options" now respects the -p flag while it did not before.
  This means that it may create an empty directory when used now rather
  than continue to use your existing options set.  You may want to not
  use -p or move your existing options directory, in
  /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/*-options, to the new format with the
  ports tree name in it.  Otherwise "poudriere bulk" will use the
  new empty directory.

  This behavior will likely change in 3.2.1 to be more backwards-compatible.

20171112:
  AFFECTS: consumers of devel/oniguruma*
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  Outdated versions of oniguruma have been removed from the ports
  tree; devel/oniguruma is the only supported version, currently
  replacing devel/oniguruma6.
  pkg should handle this automatically while users of portmaster or
  portupgrade might need to take additional manual steps:

  for users of portmaster:
	portmaster -o devel/oniguruma devel/oniguruma6
	portmaster -r devel/oniguruma

  for users of portupgrade:
	portupgrade -o devel/oniguruma devel/oniguruma6
	portupgrade -fr devel/oniguruma

20171107:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to node.js v9.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node8, has been created for the
  v8.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v8.x can replace www/node
  with www/node8 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node8
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node8 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node8 www/node

20171107:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.6 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

  to depend on python-2.7).

  Lua and Tcl bindings have been disabled by default. If you need these
  bindings, you'll need to compile vim yourself. Note that bindings are
  only for plugins written in those languages, and for interactive
  debugging. Editing, indenting, linting, completing, and syntax-highlighting
  those languages is NOT affected.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/universal-ctags
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@FreeBSD.org

  Due to conflicts with emacs ctag (editors/emacs-devel, editors/emacs-nox11, editors/emacs),
  the installed files will be prefixed with the 'u' character.
  The new binaries will de named uctags and ureadtags.

20171015:
  AFFECTS: people using WITHOUT_DEBUG
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The WITHOUT_DEBUG flag has been retired. It's only purpose was
  to override a global WITH_DEBUG, if that was defined, but many
  ports were ignoring such flag even if honouring WITH_DEBUG.

  The same effect can be obtained using ".undef WITH_DEBUG" without
  any special support in port Makefiles.

20171012:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  OpenSSH has been upgraded to 7.6p1 which has removed several deprecated
  features:

    - SSH version 1 support dropped.
    - Dropped support for hmac-ripemd160 MAC.
    - Dropped support for the ciphers arcfour, blowfish and CAST.
    - RSA keys less than 1024 bits are refused.

  The HPN option is currently disabled by default, and does not build,
  in the package.  This follows what happened in base as well.

20171004:
  AFFECTS: users of security/krb5-appl
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  Configuration options to rename kerberos ftp, telnet, rlogin, rsh, and
  rcp are now default to avoid conflicting with net/bsdrcmds packages
  (in poudriere). Deselect the options to use the original command names
  and also uninstall net/bsdrcmds to avoid the conflict.

20171002:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/cwm
  AUTHOR: tobik@FreeBSD.org

  Configuration options were renamed and you need to update your ~/.cwmrc
  accordingly.  Make sure to check cwmrc(5) for the new option names.
  cwm-migrate-config.pl can help in migrating your ~/.cwmrc.

20171001:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/isync using Maildir sub-folders
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  If you have Maildir sub-folders, you need to update the configuration
  to specify the naming style.

  Please refer to the mbsync(1) man page section 'SubFolders
  Verbatim|Maildir++|Legacy' on how to make the apropriate changes.

20170930:
  AFFECTS: users of PHP and its modules
  AUTHOR: eugen@FreeBSD.org

  All lang/php* ports switched to depend on devel/oniguruma6
  instead of previous oniguruma version some time ago.

  If you have not moved from devel/oniguruma5 before and
  have troubles updating PHP,

  for users of portmaster:
	portmaster -o devel/oniguruma6 devel/oniguruma5
	portmaster -r devel/oniguruma6

  for users of portupgrade:
	portupgrade -o devel/oniguruma6 devel/oniguruma5
	portupgrade -fr devel/oniguruma6

  pkg should handle this automatically.

20170928:
  AFFECTS: users of security/courier-authlib and its modules
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The affected ports have been modified to follow the upstream
  suggested best practice to use the sysconftool on installation.

  Please make sure your configuration files include all the comments
  that tool uses to correctly update the configuration on update.

  You can use the ".sample" or ".dist" files as templates for missing
  comments if needed.

20170915:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/cargo
  AUTHOR: rust@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with version 1.19.0, Cargo is provided with Rust. Therefore,
  devel/cargo was merged into lang/rust.

20170914:
  AFFECTS: users of CMake & CMake Modules
  AUTHOR: adridg@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/cmake-modules port has been merged into devel/cmake.

  The benefit of being able to update the modules without the binary
  is outweighed by the issues caused by having the binary out-of-sync
  with the modules.

  Users should delete the devel/cmake-modules package and then
  upgrade or reinstall devel/cmake.

  All ports have been updated to depend only on CMake.

  AFFECTS: users of security/gnupg
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  security/gnupg has become the new stable version of GnuPG. This is
  an LTS branch. gnupg20 will reach EOL at the end of the year, and all
  gnupg20 users should migrate to gnupg22.

20170808:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler has been updated to version
  8.0.2.  Hence it is recommended to rebuild or reinstall all the
  dependent ports and the lang/ghc port itself in one of the following
  ways:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc

  In case of pkg(8), it is probably safer to remove all the GHC-dependent
  packages along with GHC and reinstall everything from scratch.  For
  example:

  # pkg query "%ro" ghc > ghc-pkgs.txt
  # pkg delete -y lang/ghc

  In ghc-pkgs.txt, check and remove all the packages that have been moved
  on the update, then use this command:

  # pkg install -y `cat ghc-pkgs.txt`

20170807:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot2 and mail/dovecot2-pigeonhole
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Now that dovecot1 has been removed from the ports tree, dovecot2
  and dovecot2-pigeonhole have been renamed to simply dovecot and
  dovecot-pigeonhole.

  pkg should handle the rename automatically, but if you run into
  trouble, you can point pkg at the new origin via:

  # pkg set -o mail/dovecot2:mail/dovecot
  # pkg set -o mail/dovecot2-pigeonhole:mail/dovecot-pigeonhole

  Similarly, you can point portmaster at the new location via:

  # portmaster -o mail/dovecot mail/dovecot2

  If all else fails, just remove and reinstall the package:

  # pkg delete dovecot2
  # pkg install dovecot

20170806:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot2-antispam-plugin
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Development of the antispam plugin ceased years ago, and upstream
  recommends using pigeonhole (mail/dovecot2-pigeonhole) instead.

  See https://wiki2.dovecot.org/HowTo/AntispamWithSieve for a recipe
  to replicate the antispam plugin's behaviour.

20170729:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailscanner
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  Version 5.0.3 of MailScanner introduced a serious bug in packaging.
  Unfortunately if it is installed, your configuration has been deleted.

  If you have managed to get it working, please back up
  /usr/local/etc/MailScanner as it will also be deleted on deinstall
  of the same package.

20170712:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/apr1
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  APR was updated to 1.6.0 and APR-util was updated to 1.6.2

  The Apache Portable Runtime project removed support for FreeTDS from the
  APR Utilities in version 1.6. Users of FreeTDS will have to migrate
  configurations to use the newly added ODBC support in conjunction with
  FreeTDS using FreeTDS' ODBC capabilities.

  Please rebuild all ports which are using functions from APR/APR-util
  such as Apache, Subversion, etc. Normally, you can obtain the list of
  dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r apr

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on APR(-util) to avoid
  dangling shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this
  correctly, portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to
  rebuild all dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r apr
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr devel/apr1

  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  The rabbitmq-3.6.10_1 port has been changed to use version 19 of
  the Erlang runtime, because RabbitMQ is not yet compatible with
  version 20.

  Upgrades to the previous rabbitmq-3.6.10 must be avoided as
  they can lead to data corruption due to changes in Erlang 20.

20170622:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 9.3 to 9.5.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 9.3.12, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql93-server postgresql93-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql93-server-9.3.17.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql93-contrib-9.3.17.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # mv /usr/local/pgsql/data /usr/local/pgsql/data93
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql93-server databases/postgresql93-contrib databases/postgresql93-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql95-server databases/postgresql95-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql95-server databases/postgresql95-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql95-server databases/postgresql95-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # service postgresql initdb
  # su -l pgsql -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /usr/local/pgsql/data93/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /usr/local/pgsql/data/"

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  AFFECTS: users of editors/calligra
  AUTHOR: groot@kde.org

  Calligra has been updated to 3.0.1, which is a KDE Frameworks 5 (KF5)
  based application. Calligra now uses Qt5 and KF5. The translations have
  been merged (upstream) into the application, so separate language /
  translation ports are no longer provided. Krita has been split out
  (upstream) into a separate application, which is packaged as
  graphics/krita. Kexi, the visual database applications creator,
  is packaged separately as databases/kexi.

  Users of Calligra are encouraged to install Krita and Kexi separately,
  and to report issues with the upgrade to kde@.

  * Move Gantt charts to external plugin: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gantt
  * Move Gravatar to external plugin: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gravatar

20170602:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 5 in presence of binutils
  AUTHOR: amdmi3@FreeBSD.org

  gold linker from binutils 2.28 may produce duplicate library
  symbols, which makes shared libraries created with it not usable
  with conventional ld linker.

  This affects Qt, as qt5-qmake will detect gold and use it to build
  Qt libraries. Broken libQt5Core will be produced and ports which
  depend on it will then fail to link with the following errors:

    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x27ac8): multiple definition of `__bss_start at Qt_5'
    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x27ac8): first defined here
    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x27ac8): multiple definition of `_edata at Qt_5'
    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x27ac8): first defined here
    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x2b2d0): multiple definition of `_end at Qt_5'

  Qt5 was fixed to ignore gold. If you see these errors, you
  need to rebuild qt5-qmake, then all qt5-* ports.

20170529:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/dsbmd
  AUTHOR: mk@freeshell.de

  Due to new configuration variables and semantic changes, users of dsbmd
  version 0.2 and earlier should consider recreating their dsbmd.conf from
  the new dsbmd.conf.sample.

20170518:
  AFFECTS: users of www/yarn
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The default node backend for yarn has switched to www/node. Binary
  package users should expect the node backend to be switched during
  the upgrade. To keep the node6 (LTS) backend, rebuild www/yarn with
  the NODE6 backend option enabled.

20170517:
  AFFECTS: users of security/pecl-ssh2
  AUTHOR: dbaio@FreeBSD.org

  The security/pecl-ssh2 has been upgraded to version 1.0, and the new

20170412:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ansible
  AUTHOR: lifanov@FreeBSD.org

  The default value for ansible_python_interpreter has been changed
  to match the upstream /usr/bin/python. If managing FreeBSD systems,
  adjust the hosts database to explicitly set a valid python interpreter:

  [freebsd]
  host1

  [freebsd_vars]
  ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/local/bin/python2.7

20170411:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.5 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20170411:
  AFFECTS: www/firefox

  It turned out that arbitary versions of p5-Parse-Pidl may lead to the
  hard to explain crashes of the Samba server and utilities(in particular
  we suspect it was responsible for the troubles with the DC provisioning).

  The format of several log messages emitted by the packet code has
  changed to include additional information about the user and

  https://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.6.0.html

  For the vfs_fruit users:

  Users on *BSD must rename the metadata xattr used by vfs_fruit when
  using the default setting "fruit:metadata = netatalk".

  Due to a glitch in the Samba xattr API compatibility layer for FreeBSD and a
  mistake in vfs_fruit, vfs_fruit ended up using the wrong xattr name when
  configured with "fruit:metadata = netatalk" (default). Instead of the correct

  org.netatalk.Metadata

  it used

  netatalk.Metadata

  Starting with Samba 4.6 vfs_fruit will use the correct "org.netatalk.Metadata"
  which means existing installations must rename this xattrs. For this purpose
  Samba now includes a new tool `mvxattr`.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/pecl-mailparse
  AUTHOR: dbaio@bsd.com.br

  The mail/pecl-mailparse has been upgraded to version 3.0.2, and the new
  version is not compatible with PHP5. If you need PHP5 support, you can
  find version 2.1.6 in mail/pecl-mailparse2.

20170319:

  1.3.0 in textproc/pecl-yaml1.

20170316:
  AFFECTS: users of python setuptools
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The python setuptools ports have been renamed to better match other python ports.
  Ports users need to rename them so that portupgrade and portmaster do not
  get confused.  For example:

    pkg set -n py27-setuptools27:py27-setuptools
    pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools27:devel/py27-setuptools
  or
    pkg set -n py35-setuptools35:py35-setuptools
    pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools35:devel/py35-setuptools

20170312:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/ack
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  ack has been renamed back to p5-ack to match our perl naming. You could
  run the following to update pkg database:

    # pkg set -n ack:p5-ack
    # pkg set -o textproc/ack:textproc/p5-ack

  AFFECTS: users of devel/mtbl
  AUTHOR: truckman@FreeBSD.org

  There is a libmtbl shared library version bump in mtbl version 1.0.0.
  The affected dependent ports have had PORTREVISION bumps, but you will
  need to rebuild any applications that link to libmtbl.

20170220:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/filebeat sysutils/metricbeat sysutils/packetbeat
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The three elasticsearch beats ports have merged into one single port
  systuils/beats that installs all of the above and some more. The reason is to
  make the port more maintainable and also that the new heartbeat beat would
  conflict with sysutils/heartbeat.

20170220:
  AFFECTS: devel/libevent2
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  libevent2 has been renamed back to libevent as the default version.
  If you manage out of tree ports make sure to run the following:

    # pkg set -n libevent2:libevent
    # pkg set -o devel/libevent2:devel/libevent

20170218:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 4 and Qt 5
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Following what is already done in Qt 5, the Qt 4 ports no longer install
  their binaries into ${LOCALBASE}/bin (which is "/usr/local/bin" in most
  cases). Additionally, the "-qt4" suffix has been dropped from the file names
  of the binaries that had it, such as "qmake-qt4".

  The new misc/qtchooser port is now used to choose whether a Qt 4 or Qt 5
  version of a binary such as "moc", "qmake" or "designer" will be used. By
  default, the Qt 5 versions are preferred, but that can be changed by setting
  the QT_SELECT environment variable to "qt4".

  qtchooser also allows one to seamlessly use other Qt installations for those
  binaries, which is particularly beneficial to people working on Qt itself or
  who need their own checkouts.

  See qtchooser(1) for more information on how to configure qtchooser.

  AFFECTS: users of www/node*
  AUTHOR: bradleythughes@fastmail.fm

  The BUNDLED_SSL option is now enabled by default on FreeBSD 10, since
  Node.js requires OpenSSL 1.0.2, and FreeBSD 10 is shipped with 1.0.1.

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/libGL, graphics/libEGL, graphics/libglesv2
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The workaround for handling conflicting libraries between the
  nvidia-driver, libGL, libEGL and libglesv2 ports was removed. If the
  nvidia-driver port is updated before the other ports, it will remove
  the libraries of said ports. This is a side effect of how the workaround
  worked. If this happens reinstalling the affected port is enough.

  pkg users can run: pkg install -f libGL libEGL libglesv2

20170211:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-server/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: rezny@FreeBSD.org

  Xorg server has been updated to 1.18.4 and autodetection has changed.
  The order in which drivers are now attempted is:
    1) vendor/model specific driver according to PCI IDs
    2) generic modesetting driver which requires a drm driver with KMS
    3) scfb, the generic framebuffer driver
    4) vesa (only if arch is x86)

  This should minimize the need for xorg.conf files. It is recommended to
  load the correct KMS driver (i915kms.ko or radeonkms.ko) via rc.conf,
  i.e. kld_list="i915kms.ko", to ensure correct functionality. Although
  the vendor drivers may attempt to load the correct drm driver, which
  does not always work, the modesetting driver assumes the required KMS
  driver is already loaded and will fail if there is none. The modesetting
  driver is now recommended as an alternative to the Intel driver; the
  performance is comparable and stability is better with modesetting. The
  ATI driver continues to offer better performance than modesetting.

20170203:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl-devel
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The version 2.5.1 bumps the libcrypto, libssl and libtls shared library
  versions. You will have to rebuild all packages that depend on
  libressl-devel. Check the 20160811 libressl entry for more detailed
  guidance on rebuilding.

20170202:
  AFFECTS: users of www/uwsgi
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The previous disruptive changes to uwsgi for security have been remediated
  through creation of a dedicated uwsgi user/group and utilizing the
  uwsgi feature to set socket ownership. The uwsgi daemon by default now
  has the following properties:

  * Process runs as uwsgi user and group (UID/GID 165)
  * Socket mode is 660, still protecting unauthorized access from "other"
  * Socket ownership is www:www, restoring compatibility

20170130:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/ice, devel/py-ice, devel/php5-ice
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  Since __WORDSIZE as defined by <stdint.h> always reports 32 when using
  C++98/03 (unless __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS is set explictly), Ice 3.6.3 used
  "long long" for Int64 instead of "long" on 64-bit platforms by mistake.
  A workaround has been added in version 3.6.3_2 of these three ports,
  requiring to upgrade all of them at the same time and to rebuild all
  custom code that links against them.

20170129:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/motion
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  Version 3.x expected the configuration files to reside in:
	${LOCALBASE}/etc
  Version 4.x expects the configuration files to reside in:
	${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion
  This was unfortunately overlooked when the port was updated to 4.x, but it
  has now been fixed to install the default configuration file in the new
  location. The rc script now checks for motion.conf in the new location.

  While you may be able to simply copy your old motion.conf to the new location,
  it is recommended to review ${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion/motion.conf and make
  changes to it based on your old ${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion.conf as some options
  have been added and removed.

  Further, if you use motion with multiple cameras and have
  ${LOCALBASE}/etc/thread[0-9].conf files, they should be moved to
  ${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion as well. These files are deprecated and should be
  renamed to camera[0-9].conf and in motion.conf, lines like:
	thread /usr/local/etc/thread1.conf
  Should be converted to:
	camera /usr/local/etc/motion/camera1.conf

20170127:
  AFFECTS: users of www/uwsgi
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The default socket mode for uwsgi as 777 is a severe security concern.
  This has been remediated by changing the rc script to default to 600.
  The mode is configurable with rc.conf values: uwsgi_socket_mode="600"
  or for a profile named "www", uwsgi_www_socket_mode="600".

  algorithms.

20170120:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql56-server
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  databases/mysql56-server was updated to 5.6.35 which included backported
  rc script changes from the mysql57-server port. This broke mysql_optfile in
  rc.conf and also forced a sample my.cnf if none existed. MySQL has
  some parameters which cannot be changed after a database has been
  created, so this caused MySQL to fail to start.

  This change was reverted in mysql56-server-5.6.35_1

  An additional change was made in mysql56-server-5.6.35_2 to prevent
  automatic loading of a sample my.cnf which was causing issues for
  users who were running without a my.cnf.

20170117:
  AFFECTS: users of EoL'ed FreeBSD versions (<10.3, 11 prior to 11.0)
  AUTHOR: amdmi3@FreeBSD.org

  The ports system will now refuse to build anything if it's run on
  outdated system version. This protects users from unexpected build
  failures after code to support EoL'ed systems is removed from the

  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.2 to 2.3.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.2 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.2 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.2

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby23 lang/ruby22
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.3

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby22:lang/ruby23
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.3.\* -fr lang/ruby23

  AUTHOR: Colin Booth <colin-ports@heliocat.net>

  skalibs has undergone a major version bump and compatibility is not
  guaranteed for software with a runtime dependency on
  libskarnet.so.2.3.9.0. This will not affect lang/execline or
  sysutils/s6 as those are statically linked against libskarnet.a.

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/bareos-*
  AUTHOR: rand@iteris.com

  Bareos v1.6.x changed the configuration scheme, from one configuration
  file per Bareos component (file daemon, storage daemon, and director)
  to several configuration files, in several directories, for each
  component. See http://doc.bareos.org/master/html/bareos-manual-main-reference.html

  The new scheme will use all files named *.conf in the directory
  hierarchies for each component:

    /usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/
    /usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/
    /usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.d/

  To retain the old configuration scheme of one file per component add
  appropriate lines such as these to your /etc/rc.conf:

    bareos_dir_config="/usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.conf"
    bareos_fd_config="/usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-fd.conf"
    bareos_sd_config="/usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.conf"

20161113:

  The libosinfo port was separated into three different ports
  to follow the upstream split:

   - sysutils/osinfo-db-tools: contains the CLI tools
   - misc/osinfo-db: contains database with OS data
   - devel/libosinfo: the library

  As osinfo-db-tools now ships binaries that previously were
  part of libosinfo, it's required to delete the old libosinfo
  package to prevent conflict because of same files installation:

  # pkg delete libosinfo

  And then install the new version.

20161112:
  AFFECTS: users of security/heimdal
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Heimdal in the base system and security/heimdal <= 1.5.3_6 use
  Berkeley DB to store principals into /var/heimdal/heimdal.db and
  the database format is version 3 by default.  On the other hand,
  security/heimdal 1.5.3_7 or newer use the newer version of
  Berkeley DB and the database format is version 9.
  These two versions are not compatible with each other.  If there is
  a mismatch between Heimdal utilities and its database format,
  you will get an error like the following:

  # /usr/local/sbin/kadmin -l dump
  BDB0641 __db_meta_setup: /var/heimdal/heimdal.db: unexpected file type or format
  kadmin: hdb_open: opening /var/heimdal/heimdal: Invalid argument

  This mismatch can occur in the following three cases:

  1. You used Heimdal in the base system and switch to use security/heimdal
     after creating /var/db/heimdal.db.

  2. You used security/heimdal >= 1.5.3_7 and switch to use one in the
     base system.

  3. You used security/heimdal < 1.5.3_7 and upgrade it to 1.5.3_7 or later.

  To fix this mismatch, you need to dump contents of heimdal.db and
  rebuild the database by using kadmin(8) utility.

  If you use Heimdal in the base system or older versions of
  security/heimdal, and plan to switch to use
  security/heimdal >= 1.5.3_7, execute the following command
  *after* creating a backup copy of /var/heimdal and installing
  security/heimdal:

  # /usr/bin/kadmin -l dump /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db
  # /usr/local/sbin/kadmin -l load /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump

  The above example assumes security/heimdal is installed into
  /usr/local.  If your base system is compiled with WITHOUT_KERBEROS
  use the following instead:

  # db_dump185-5 /var/heimdal/heimdal.db | db_load-5 /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.new
  # chown 0600 /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.new
  # mv /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.new /var/heimdal/heimdal.db

  db_dump and db_load utilitites are installed by databases/db5 as
  dependency of security/heimdal.

  If you want to switch from security/heimdal to Heimdal in the base
  system, use the following:

  # /usr/local/sbin/kadmin -l dump /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db
  # /usr/bin/kadmin -l load /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.24 lang/perl5.20

	  You can now remove the DEFAULT_VERSIONS line added earlier

  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  For better php70 support, the squirrelmail port has switched from
  PEAR database access to PDO. If you are using squirrelmail with
  a database backend, you'll need to install a corresponding PDO
  database module, such as php56-pdo_sqlite.

  AFFECTS: users of security/srm
  AUTHOR: rakuco@FreeBSD.org

  srm has been updated from 1.2.12 to 1.2.15. Since version 1.2.14,
  srm defaults to using its "simple" mode to overwrite files (one pass
  writing 0x00 to the files) instead of the 35-pass Gutmann method.

  AUTHOR: woodsb02@FreeBSD.org

  Quassel is now split into two ports / packages; one for providing
  the server backend (irc/quassel-core), and one for providing the
  client front-end (irc/quassel). Alternatively, the irc/quassel
  port can be built with the MONO option enabled to also install
  the client and server combined into a single monolithic binary.

20161028:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssl and security/openssl-devel
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The shared library versions of OpenSSL have been bumped to avoid
  issues with ports' and base's OpenSSL not being binary compatible.

  Please rebuild all ports that depend on OpenSSL if you use OpenSSL
  from ports.

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -r openssl
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr security/openssl

  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/deluge
  AUTHOR: rm@FreeBSD.org

  Deluge port has been split out onto CLI part and GUI part. So if user
  only needs deluged, net-p2p/deluge-cli should be installed. For full
  deluge installation, including GTK+ GUI client, net-p2p/deluge should
  be installed as a usual.

  Old deluge package should be removed manually first:

  # pkg delete deluge

  After that install preferred deluge package as usual.

  With the rename of the audio/squeezeboxserver port to
  audio/logitechmediaserver, the server and database are now installed in
  different locations by default (/usr/local/share/logitechmediaserver and
  /var/db/logitechmediaserver respectively).

  If you were an existing user of audio/squeezeboxserver, you should
  consider backing up you server configuration files and database before
  upgrading to audio/logitechmediaserver. If you wish to override the
  default locations for storing the server and database, you can set the

  1. Log off from Roundcube.
  2. Manually drop all carddav_* tables from your db backend.
  3. Upgrade the mail/roundcube-carddav port.

  The new tables will be created upon login. The CardDAV plugin will need to be
  reconfigured.

  If you are running php < 7.0.0, you'll need to set the plugin option:
  $prefs['_GLOBAL']['suppress_version_warning'] = true;

  Nginx now creates logs under /var/log/nginx/ and changes default log
  names from "nginx-access.log" and "nginx-error.log" to "access.log" and

  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql96-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The default unix user used by the PostgreSQL daemon has changed to
  `postgres' to reflect the long time upstream's convention. Any scripts
  you have using the old `pgsql' unix user should be modified when upgrading to
  PostgreSQL version 9.6. Older versions of PostgreSQL will continue using
  `pgsql' until their end-of-life.

  For users with UTF-8 locales in the database: The ICU patch is *activated by
  default* for the PostgreSQL-9.6 server. For previous versions it was optional
  and default off, but this has changed. Please read the entry here below from
  20160811 and understand the consequences of changing between ICU and system
  locale for database collation (short version: don't). pg_upgrade requires the
  collation method to be the same (or a reindex), while pg_dump/restore does not.

  Also, the default home directory for the postgres user is now
  /var/db/postgres, and the default data directory for PostgreSQL 9.6 is
  /var/db/postgres/data96.

  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: cem@FreeBSD.org

  The NVidia driver has been updated to version 367.35.  Starting with
  version 358.09, new kernel module was added, nvidia-modeset.ko.  This
  new driver component works in conjunction with the nvidia.ko kernel
  module to program the display engine of the GPU.

  Users that experience hangs when starting X11 server, or observe

	(II) NVIDIA(0): Validated MetaModes:
	(II) NVIDIA(0):     "NULL"

  messages in their /var/log/Xorg.0.log file should replace ``nvidia''
  with ``nvidia-modeset'' in /boot/loader.conf or /etc/rc.conf files,
  depending on how they prefer to load NVidia driver kernel module.

20160829:
  AFFECTS: users of security/sshguard
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  Sshguard has been updated to 1.7.0. There have been several changes to
  this release. Notably the hosts and ipfilter backends are no longer
  supported. If you need these backends to be supported and you missed
  the survey sent out by upstream I urge you to contact upstream.

  The hosts backend was previously served by security/sshguard directly.
  The additional backends were slave ports with package name suffixes. I
  have opted to keep the master/slave port relationship but not choose a
  specific backend for security/sshguard. Instead it is now a metaport
  which will prompt you for which backend you prefer. If no backend is
  configured it will depend on security/sshguard-ipfw, which is the
  native FreeBSD firewall. This my be surprising to users who depended
  on security/sshguard which only provided hosts/TCP Wrappers blocking,
  but there is no replacement at this time.

  I would also like to document that sshguard no longer accepts the -e
  argument which allowed external scripts to run when sshguard finds a
  match. As a result the null backend can no longer be used to create
  custom blocking functionality; it only serves as a detection backend.

  If the removed backends return due to user demand they will be added
  as slave ports for consistency. I apologize for any inconvenience and
  lack of notice on the deprecation of these features.

  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.4 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.
  With this update, the patch for the OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER has been
  removed. This causes issues with a number of ports. Patches for all
  ports for which this issues is known can be found on
  https://wiki.freebsd.org/LibreSSL/Ports#OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20160811:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresqlNN-server with ICU patch
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The ICU patch is added to the PostgreSQL-9.5 server. Please note that you
  must never change between using the ICU patch and using system locale for
  the same database cluster without REINDEXing all TEXT/VARCHAR columns, or
  dump and restore your database. Failing to do so will result in corrupted
  indexes due to the differences between the locale definitions. ICU will
  always be the better choice for speed and correctness.

  Also, the ICU patch used to support other Unicode encodings than UTF-8,
  but that has been removed due to lack of demand and the complicated testing
  required. If you use another Unicode encoding and rely on ICU for collation,
  please refrain from upgrading the postgresql server and instead contact the
  author named above.

20160722:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: jkim@FreeBSD.org

  VirtualBox has been updated to 5.0.26 and it is incompatible with old

  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The directory containing icons has changed from ".../icons" to ".../icon".
  awstats has, in its suggested configuration file, contained an alias
  from /awstatsicons. After applying the awstats-7.5 update, you must
  update that alias to point to /usr/local/www/awstats/icon (just remove
  the "s" at the end).

20160708:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/screen
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  GNU Screen was updated to version 4.4.0 (r417201).  Note that there was

  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  The default location for my.cnf has changed from "/var/db/mysql/my.cnf"
  to "/usr/local/etc/mysql/my.cnf". Existing my.cnf files must be merged
  manually with the new default and moved to the new location. To
  continue using the my.cnf file at the old location, set "mysql_optfile"

  AFFECTS: users of databases/py-apsw
  AUTHOR: rm@FreeBSD.org

  SQLite 3.12 completely changed the semantics of VFS.xGetLastError() in an
  incompatible way. This required a rewrite of the relevant C, Python and test
  code. If you implement or use this method then you have to rewrite your code
  too. Also note that running the test suite from an earlier version of APSW

  And if you wanted a port that was not security/openssl, you needed to add,
  for example:

  OPENSSL_PORT=	security/libressl

  Now, all you need to do is:

  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=  ssl=libressl

  Valid values are base, openssl, openssl-devel, libressl, and libressl-devel.

  The port has been updated to the latest "unstable" version of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.
  With this update, the patch for the OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER has been
  removed. This causes issues with a number of ports. Patches for many of
  these issues can be found on
  https://wiki.freebsd.org/LibreSSL/Ports#OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER

  After upgrading to 2.4.0, manually update all packages that depend on

  The invocation for extras has changed. Some extras might fail unless
  you pass all options/arguments separated by quotes:

      filter myfilter dnsbl "-c /var/chroot/dnsbl" "-h my.dnsbl.com"

  Additionally, extras now run in a chroot. Either pass "-C" to skip the
  chroot entirely (not recommended), or put all required config files,
  resolv.conf, and external binaries into the chroot. For example:

      # mkdir -p /var/chroot/dnsbl/etc
      # cp /etc/resolv.conf /var/chroot/dnsbl/etc

      And pass "-c /var/chroot/dnsbl" to the filter.

20160526:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/opensmtpd
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  Due to changes to the rc-script you must stop smtpd prior to upgrading
  mail/opensmtpd to version 5.9.2

  # service smtpd stop

  Then upgrade OpenSMTPD to version 5.9.2.
  Additionally version 5.9.2 changes the file mode bits for two directories.
  To allow existing installations to start successfully you must apply the
  following changes

  # chown -R root:_smtpq /var/spool/smtpd/offline
  # chmod -R 770 /var/spool/smtpd/offline
  # chmod -R 700 /var/spool/smtpd/purge

  After applying the changes, the smtpd daemon can successfully be started.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/qtcreator
  AUTHOR: loise@kde.org

  QBS (Qt Build System) was previously shipped as part of qtcreator, now
  it is independently available as devel/qbs. However, on upgrading
  qtcreator to 3.6.1, the depends will detect qbs through a previously
  installed qtcreator port and will not build/install correctly
  (devel/qbs won't be installed automatically as depends)

  The solution is to pkg remove qtcreator, then building works correctly.

20160523:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/db6 port has been updated to release 6.2.23.

  This requires manual action in two places:
    1. dependent applications need to be recompiled,
    2. SQL databases, if any, need to be reindexed.

  To obtain a list of ports needing a recompilation,
  the following command should provide it:

  # pkg info -r db6

  Then rebuild db6 and the dependent ports.  For pkg users, this should
  be transparent.

  Portmaster users:
  #  portmaster -r databases/db6
  Portupgrade users:
  #  portupgrade -fr databases/db6

  In order to reindex SQL databases, a db6-upgrade61.sh script is
  provided in ${PREFIX}/bin, if and only if the port's SQL option is
  enabled.  For detailed reindexing instructions, see
  http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_05/html/installation/sqlite_ver61.html

  soon as possible, as upstream support will end two months from now.

  The www/node5 port has been created to aid users transition. Use one of
  the following commands to continue using node.js v5.x:

  # pkg install node5
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node5 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node5 www/node

  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  LibreSSL 2.3 has removed SSLv3 support completely which leads to issues
  with a number of ports. Patches for many of these issues can be found
  on https://wiki.freebsd.org/OpenSSL/No-SSLv3

  After upgrading to 2.3.4, manually update all packages that depend on
  any of the libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and
  libtls) since the versions of these libraries have changed. Normally,
  you can obtain the list of dependent software by running the following
  command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

  AFFECTS: users of mail/dspam
  AUTHOR: junovitch@FreeBSD.org

  dspam has been modified to no longer run as root:mail by default.
  Existing configuration must be adjusted to reflect using a non-privileged
  port and the /var/run/dspam directory for PID and socket files.  If you
  need dspam to run as root for your mail setup, you can use the SETUID
  config option to enable the old insecure behavior.

  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The ${MODULESDIR}, default directory for dynamic modules, has been
  changed from ${ETCDIR}/modules to ${PREFIX}/libexec/${PORTNAME}.
  It's highly recommended to review existing configuration files of
  nginx, i.e. ${PREFIX}/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/icinga2
  AUTHOR: lme@FreeBSD.org

  The creation of Icinga2 directories and files in /var is now controlled
  by the /etc/rc.conf variable icinga2_mkvar.  Earlier ports always
  created the /var entries, but could slow startup significantly when /var
  was a normal disk rather than a RAM disk.  icinga2_mkvar defaults to
  "NO".

  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba 4.2.x and 4.3.x ports have been updated to address
  BadLock(http://badlock.org) vulnerability, as well as few other
  discovered.

  Please note that Samba 4.1.x and older versions are also affected by
  the issues fixed with this release but are not supported anymore. It is
  strongly recommend to upgrade to a recent version at your earliest
  convenience.

  The security updates include new smb.conf options and a number of
  stricter behaviours to prevent Man in the Middle attacks. Between these
  changes, compatibility with a large number of older software versions
  has been lost in the default configuration.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby21
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.1 to 2.2.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.1 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.1 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.1

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby22 lang/ruby21
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.2

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby21:lang/ruby22
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.2.\* -fr lang/ruby22

  AFFECTS: print/cups-base, print/cups-client, print/cups-image
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The cups-base, cups-client and cups-image packages have been combined
  into one cups package.

  If you build your own ports the easiest way to update is to delete these
  packages first and then build and install print/cups.

  If you are using binary packages, depending on the packages installed on
  your system, pkg(8)'s solver might get confused. In this case do not proceed
  with the upgrade but delete first the packages:

  pkg delete -fg "cups*"

  Then usual upgrade process: pkg upgrade

  The device URI of USB printers has changed so you have to adjust the
  printer configuration.  Go to http://localhost:631/printers/.  Click on
  your printer and select "Modify Printer" in the Administration drop-down.
  You should then be able to select the new URI of the printer.  The web
  interface requires cookies and JavaScript to function properly so make
  sure your browser does not block them.

  The package also installs a devd(8) configuration file now that gives
  cups access to USB printers.  Unless you have any special needs you can
  remove any devd(8), devfs.conf(5) or devfs.rules(5) configuration related
  to cups that you may have added in the past.

  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  Varnish has been updated to 4.1.0. As part of the update an effort has
  been made to increase the security of the varnish daemons by utilizing
  separate UIDs. Users who upgrade will likely run into a permissions
  issue as a result. The simplest solution is to delete files varnish
  will recreate with the correct permissions and to adjust permissions
  of existing log files.

  The following changes will allow you to start varnishd, varnishlog,
  and varnishncsa successfully:

  # rm -r /usr/local/varnish/$(hostname)
  # rm /var/run/varnishlog.pid
  # rm /var/run/varnishncsa.pid
  # chown varnishlog /var/log/varnish.log
  # chown varnishlog /var/log/varnishncsa.log

  Please also note that the syntax for binding to additional IPs has
  changed in 4.1.0. Multiple listening addresses are now specified by
  using multiple -a arguments. In rc.conf it would look like this:

  varnishd_listen="x.x.x.x:80 -a y.y.y.y:80"

  AFFECTS: users of security/sshguard-ipfw
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The sshguard update to 1.6.2 introduces a rewritten IPFW backend. The
  previous approach was to insert individual block rules with a
  predefined  numbered range. This does not scale well and is not
  flexible so the design was scrapped. The new approach utilizes IPFW
  tables. The sshguard IPFW backend now inserts offenders into hardcoded
  table 22.

  To continue blocking the attackers effectively you will need to add a
  block rule like the following:

  ipfw add deny all from 'table(22)' to any

  AUTHOR: sbruno@FreeBSD.org

  The Jemalloc update at svn r286871 introduced some TLS enhancements
  for MIPS targets that require a bit of workaround.  Users who want
  to build MIPS packages should update their host systems past r286871
  prior to upgrading their qemu-user-static/qemu-sbruno ports.

  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  ffmpeg has been updated to the version 2.8.
  If you are using binary pkg, 'pkg upgrade' will do the right thing.
  Users of portmaster/portupgrade must rebuild all ports which depend
  on ffmpeg.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -w -r ffmpeg
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr multimedia/ffmpeg

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/jpeg
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  Default implementation of jpeg has been switched from graphics/jpeg to
  graphics/jpeg-turbo.  To perform the upgrade, use instructions below.

  If using binary packages: 'pkg upgrade' will do the right thing.  If it
  doesn't and complains about 'Cannot solve problem using SAT solver', run
  'pkg delete -f jpeg' before 'pkg upgrade'.

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o graphics/jpeg-turbo jpeg

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -f -o graphics/jpeg-turbo graphics/jpeg

  If you compile your ports and want to keep using IJG's jpeg implementation,
  add this line to your /etc/make.conf file:
  JPEG_PORT=graphics/jpeg

20150914:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Binary package users can ignore this.

  The way lang/perl5* ports install themselves has changed.  From now on, only
  the default Perl port (currently 5.20), or the version listed in
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS, will install /usr/local/bin/perl.

  If you are NOT using the default version of Perl (as of right now, it is
  5.20) you MUST add a line setting the version you are using to your
  /etc/make.conf, to preserve /usr/local/bin/perl:

  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=	perl5=5.xx

  If your Perl package name is not called perl5-5.xx.y but perl5.xx-5.xx.y,
  you will need to rename it so that portupgrade and portmaster do not get
  confused:

    pkg set -n perl5.xx:perl5

  After this date, to migrate from one Perl version to the other, you must
  first put the DEFAULT_VERSIONS line in your make.conf, and then, for example,
  if you want to move from 5.20 to 5.22, do:

	pkg set -o lang/perl5.20:lang/perl5.22
	portmaster `pkg shlib -qR libperl.so.5.20`

  If you do not do that, you will replace your default Perl 5.20 installation
  (one that has /usr/local/bin/perl) with an installation that does not have
  /usr/local/bin/perl, and it will break everything.

  AFFECTS: users of print/texlive-base
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  pdfclose and pdfopen utilities in print/texlive-base are now in a separate
  port print/xpdfopen.  While upgrading print/texlive-base, a conflict may
  occur between pdfclose utility installed by an old print/texlive-base and
  one being installed by print/xpdfopen.  If it occurred on your system,
  remove the installed print/texlive-base first by using the following
  command:

   # pkg delete -f texlive-base

  AFFECTS: users of editors/libreoffice
  AUTHOR: jkim@FreeBSD.org

  editors/libreoffice has been updated to 5.0.1.  However, FreeBSD 9.x is
  no longer supported because it requires C++11-capable library installed
  in the base.  If you cannot upgrade your system or still want 4.3.x for
  some reason, use editors/libreoffice4.

20150822:
  AFFECTS: users of print/ghostscript*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/ghostscript{7,8,9,9-agpl} have been split into
  print/ghostscript{7,8,9,9-agpl}-{base,x11}.
  print/ghostscript*-nox11 ports have been removed.

  The -base installs Ghostscript binaries, libgs, and other data files
  and it depends on no X11 library.  The -x11 installs a small shared
  library to enable x11* devices in the installed -base package.

  In most cases, Ghostscript is installed as a dependency.  A port/package
  which requires Ghostscript will automatically pick up -base, and
  when x11* devices required it will pick up -x11 in addition.

  If one wants to install Ghostscript manually and full compatibility
  with the previous versions, just install -x11 because it installs
  -base as a dependency.  Combination of the two provides the same
  functionality as before.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler has been updated to version
  7.10.2 and Haskell Platform has been removed.  As a result, it is
  recommended to rebuild or reinstall all the dependent ports and the
  lang/ghc port itself in one of the following ways:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc

  In case of pkg(8), it is probably safer to remove all the GHC-dependent
  packages along with GHC and reinstall everything from scratch.  For
  example:

  # pkg query "%ro" ghc > ghc-pkgs.txt
  # pkg delete -y lang/ghc

  In ghc-pkgs.txt, check and remove all the packages that have been moved,
  then:

  # pkg install -y `cat ghc-pkgs.txt`

  The Icinga port has been split into two ports: net-mgmt/icinga-core
  which contains the Icinga 1.x backend and net-mgmt/icinga-classicweb
  which contains the Icinga classic web (CGI) interface. The latter can
  be both used with Icinga 1.x and the Icinga 2 port (net-mgmt/icinga2).
  A new meta-port net-mgmt/icinga was added which depends on both new
  ports, so updating the Icinga port should be transparent.

	portmaster -f `pkg shlib -R libperl.so.5.18|tail +2`

  NOTE:
    Perl has been removed from base more than ten years ago, so it was way past
    time for the /usr/bin/perl symlink to be removed from the port.  If for
    some strange reason, you still need it, you will have to create it
    manually.

  IMPORTANT:
    In case you have not updated your system in a while, and specifically,

  Due to conflicts between base OpenSSL and ports provided OpenSSL
  library, which is required by net/libsrtp, the srtp support has
  to be removed from the default asterisk13 port configuration,
  otherwise a not working binary would be generated.

  To get SRTP support working in the asterisk ports make sure all
  dependencies are linked against the same SSL library implementation
  to avoid runtime conflicts. On 10.1 everything will work fine
  unless ports SSL libraries are explicitly installed. On older OS
  versions(10.0 and earlier) you will need to compile all ports
  with WITH_OPENSSL_PORT=yes.

  To get working SRTP support in asterisk13 with the pjsip backend
  it is also needed to enable the EXTSRTP option in the pjsip port.

  If the CURL option is enabled also make sure the ftp/curl port
  is using a GSSAPI implementation linking to the same SSL
  implementation the other ports are using (BASE or NONE if you're
  using base OpenSSL, GSSAPI_HEIMDAL GSSAPI_MIT otherwise). If an
  incompatible option is being used the curl module will cause
  asterisk to fail on startup due to mixing calls to OpenSSL from
  base and from ports.

  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  The port now uses VersionAddendum for the port version string. Setting
  the value to "none" in your sshd_config and restarting openssh will allow
  removing the version from the banner.

  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/xorg-server and other X servers
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  All fonts ports have been modified to respect XDG and install in
  share/fonts

  The Xorg servers now are looking there by default

  If you experience font related issues, view the output of

  # fc-list

  If the list appears incomplete or has fonts still pointing to
  /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts you may forcibly update the font cache:

  # fc-cache -fs

  AFFECTS: users of editors/openoffice-4 and editors/openoffice-devel
  AUTHOR: truckman@FreeBSD.org

  Contrary to what is stated in pkg-message, openoffice-4 and
  openoffice-devel have stored user settings in ~/.openoffice.org-devel/4
  since r325370 (2013-08-25). This update expects user settings to reside
  in the more standard ~/.openoffice.org/4.

  To preserve your user settings, rename or copy them from
  ~/.openoffice.org-devel/4 to ~/.openoffice.org/4. when installing this
  update to apache-openoffice-4.1.1_7 or

  to the Icons tag and select the "Adwaita" entry in the list.

20150304:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: vsevolod@highsecure.ru

  After upgrading of libressl you should manually update all packages that
  depending on this library since its version has been changed. Normally,
  you could obtain the list of dependent software by running the following
  command:

  pkg query -e '%n = libressl' %ro

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20150301:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby20
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.0 to 2.1.

  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.0 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.0

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade -f

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby21 lang/ruby20
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.1

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby20:lang/ruby21
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.1.\* -fr lang/ruby21

  encouraged to remove it or change it to an available version.

20150224:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/bitcoin (cli utilities)

  The bitcoin-cli and bitcoin-tx utilities have been re-packaged into
  a separate port. If you require these programs, or use the bitcoin-cli
  program to access the daemon or the GUI, install net-p2p/bitcoin-utils
  to reinstall them.

20150220:
  AFFECTS: users of PHP

  The default PHP version has been updated from 5.4 to 5.6.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info php5\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

20150207:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/opensmtpd-devel
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  MYSQL, PGSQL, LDAP, and REDIS options are removed from port, as
  they're moved upstream to a separate project, which is yet to
  release snapshots. If you need those options, then please install
  "mail/opensmtpd" port instead. To do that:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o mail/opensmtpd mail/opensmtpd-devel

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o mail/opensmtpd mail/opensmtpd-devel

20150206:
  AFFECTS: users of net/serviio
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The java dependency changed from java 7 (java/openjdk7 if you haven't
  installed another java 7 implementation) to java 8 (e.g. java/openjdk8).
  If serviio is the only reason that java 7 is installed, you can delete
  java 7 after the update to serviio 1.5.0.

  The Java Polling Watch Service used in Serviio 1.5 aggressively searches
  for file system updates. Until the Serviio poller is re-enabled in 1.5.1,
  consider unchecking "Keep library automatically updated" if you have a
  large media collection or are concerned about CPU/disk usage.

20150204:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The default MySQL version has been updated from 5.5 to 5.6.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 5.5 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep MySQL 5.5 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=mysql= 5.5

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  running server instance. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  on installed packages.

  # pkg set -o databases/mysql55-client:databases/mysql56-client
  # pkg set -o databases/mysql55-server:databases/mysql56-server
  # pkg upgrade

20150118:
  AFFECTS: users of www/thttpd
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  thttpd was updated to version 2.26, which brings several user-noticeable
  changes to the port:

    - Default WWW root was changed from ${PREFIX}/www/data to more expected
      (and standard) ${WWWDIR} (${PREFIX}/www/thttpd), be sure to check and
      adjust your thttpd configuration file and/or web layout accordingly;
    - Default CGI pattern was changed to "/cgi-bin/*"; this goes better in
      line with default installation;
    - Default data MIME type was changed to "application/octet-stream";
    - thttpd's own htpasswd(1) program, which was previously installed as
      thttpdpasswd(1) to avoid conflict with other webservers, is now being
      renamed to thtpasswd(1); this not just makes it shorter, but is more
      consistent with popular GNU/Linux distributions;
    - Index pages for directories are not generated by default from now on
      for security reasons; an option (INDEXES) is provided to turn them
      back on if they are wanted;
    - IPREAL option (to respect (pass on) "X-Forwarded-For" header) is now
      turned on by default: it is often required when thttpd is used as a
      CGI server behind nginx (http://wiki.nginx.org/ThttpdCGI).

  "pkg del -f speex".

20150101:
  AFFECTS: users of net/unison and net/unison-nox11
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Unison has been upgraded to version 2.48, which uses a different wire
  protocol than 2.40 did.  In order to support synchronization with
  other computers where Unison is still at version 2.40, a new port
  net/unison240 has been created.  It provides unison240 and if that is
  GTK2-enabled, also unison240-text.  This unison240 port can be
  installed in parallel with the existing net/unison port.

20141219:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg and all xorg ports
  AUTHOR: dumbbell@FreeBSD.org

  The X.Org server (x11-servers/xorg-server) is updated to 1.14. All
  ports which provide X.Org drivers must be updated simultaneously, i.e.
  x11-drivers/xf86-*, emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions, net/tigervnc,
  etc.

  The input device autodetection backend is switched from HAL to devd.
  If you configure your keyboard layout through HAL .fdi files, you need
  to migrate this configuration to plain X.Org configuration files.

  Xymon has been updated to 4.3.18. A major change is the replacement of
  the individual cgi shell scripts with symlinks to a cgi program written
  in C. This is to mitigate shellshock on Linux systems where the
  /bin/sh -> /bin/bash. FreeBSD users were not exposed except in the
  most unusual and unsupported circumstances. However, this is an
  important update for security. This change could break your
  configuration as Henrik describes here:

  OpenSSH 6.7 disables some insecure ciphers by default, such as arcfour
  and blowfish. You may have clients using these over LAN where security is
  considered less important for the connection. For these cases you may need
  to update your Ciphers entry in your sshd_config to enable them again.

20141217:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Perl now links all .so it builds with libperl.so, it makes upgrading from one
  Perl major version to another way easier.  For binary package users, it means
  pkg upgrade will detect the libperl.so.x.yy change, and reinstall the
  affected packages.  For users using ports, it will save rebuild time as it's
  easier to detect what ports really need to be rebuilt.

  Ports users are encouraged to rebuild ports that install files in SITE_ARCH.
  If using Perl 5.18, run:

  With portupgrade:

    portupgrade -f `find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.18 -name '*.so'|xargs pkg which -qo|sort -u`

  With portmaster:

    portmaster `find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.18 -name '*.so'|xargs pkg which -qo|sort -u`

20141216:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable, security/openssh-portable66
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  All patches have been fixed for version 6.7. It is no longer required to use
  the security/openssh-portable66 port.

  The LPK option was removed from security/openssh-portable as it has been
  deprecated since May 2013. Use AuthorizedKeysCommand as a replacement.

  comms/spandsp has been upgraded to version 0.0.6
  comms/spandsp-devel is now deprecated and set for removal, all ports using
  it were converted to use newer comms/spandsp. Before upgrade you must
  remove comms/spandsp-devel so that ports can pick up new dependency:

  AFFECTS: users of TeXLive
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Several scripts in print/texlive-base have been moved to
  devel/tex-kpathsea.  Upgrading them can fail because texlive-base
  depends on tex-kpathsea, and the new tex-kpathsea tries to install
  files which were installed by the old texlive-base.  The following
  error message indicates this situation:

    pkg-static: tex-kpathsea-6.2.0_1 conflicts with texlive-base-20140525_3 (installs files into the same place).  Problematic file: /usr/local/bin/kpsewhere

  To solve this problem, remove both of tex-kpathsea and texlive-base first
  and install the new versions:

	# pkg delete -f tex-kpathsea texlive-base

20141209:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-f10 and emulators/linux_base-c6
  AUTHOR: xmj@FreeBSD.org

  The CentOS ports infrastructure has replaced Fedora 10 as default.

  1. Please delete all remaining f10 ports/packages:

     # pkg delete -f linux_base-f10 linux-f10-\*

  2. Persistently update the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf:

     compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18

    This step is necessary on all FreeBSD versions, apart from 11.0-CURRENT
    (after revision 271982).

  3. Reinstall all software depending on Linux emulation.
     As an example, reinstall linux-firefox:

     # portmaster -r linux-firefox
       or
     # portupgrade -f www/linux-firefox
       or
     # pkg install linux-firefox

  If difficulties are encountered, please follow the UPDATING entry 20140922
  but skip step 2 (OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT and OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS
  in /etc/make.conf). In case these steps do not fix the issues, please submit
  an issue report in Bugzilla and send an email to FreeBSD's emulation@ mailing
  list.

  Users who need to continue using Fedora 10 base and userland should do the
  following instead:

  1. Add these lines to /etc/make.conf:

      OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f10
      OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f10

  2. Downgrade the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf on FreeBSD versions
     newer than and including 11.0-CURRENT (after revision 271982).

       compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16

  This is all that is needed to continue using an existing Fedora 10 Linux base
  and userland.

  a package containing developer tools.  The devel/gettext port still exists
  as a metaport.

  You must first delete the existing installation of gettext and then
  reinstall it.  This will break sudo, so you *must* do this in a root
  shell (sudo -i) if you use sudo.

  # pkg delete -f gettext
  # portmaster devel/gettext

  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/x264
  AUTHOR: xmj@FreeBSD.org

  With the recent split of multimedia/x264 in library and binary and library
  components, if an application that uses libx264 is updated before x264 itself,
  multimedia/libx264 will conflict with the existing x264 package. Delete
  this package before continuing any update that depends on it:

	# pkg delete -f x264

  depend on libx264, such as ffmpeg.

20141126:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The directories where Perl modules are installed has changed.  All
  affected ports' PORTREVISION have been bumped, so upgrading should
  be as painless as possible.  The old directories have been kept in
  the default Perl @INC to make it even more painless.

  The default Perl has been switched to lang/perl5.18.  These examples
  are for switching from lang/perl5.16, if you are running a different
  version, replace lang/perl5.16 with the origin of the Perl you have
  installed.

  Binary package users:

    # pkg upgrade -f

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
        pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.18):
        portupgrade -o lang/perl5.18 -f lang/perl5.16

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
        portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.18

  Portmaster users:
        portmaster -o lang/perl5.18 lang/perl5.16

        Conservative:
        portmaster p5-

        Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
        portmaster -r perl5-

  Note: If the "perl5-" glob matches more than one port you will need to specify
        the name of the installed Perl package explicitly.  You can get its name
        by running: pkg info perl5

  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The header and library files have been moved from PREFIX/{include,lib} to
  PREFIX/{include,lib}/heimdal at r373047 to fix a library dependency
  confusion when software attempts to link a Heimdal library in base and
  an external library in LOCALBASE/lib at the same time.

  All of packages which depend on security/heimdal have to be recompiled
  and reinstalled because of this library location change.

  AFFECTS: users of x11/gnome2, graphics/clutter and lang/vala
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME 3.14 was imported. Because this is a big change some manual help is
  needed. Please use the following instructions to update.

  Make a list of the installed ports:
  # pkg info > ~/installed-ports-list

  Delete the old and conflicting packages:
  # pkg delete clutter gnome-utils gnome-panel gnome-keyring vala-vapigen \
      guile gcalctool gnome-media libgnomekbd gnome-themes at-spi
  # pkg delete gnome-screensaver gnome-applets bug-buddy \
      evolution-exchange evolution-webcal gnome-system-tools \
      seahorse-plugins gnome-control-center

  For package users the following lines will be enough:
  # pkg upgrade
  # pkg install gnome3

  For ports users should do the following:
  # portmaster -a
  # portmaster x11/gnome3

  After these steps, check with the list we made earlier if your favorite
  ports are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Most of the optional patches for OpenSSH do not apply to the 6.7 update yet.
  The 6.6 version has been copied to security/openssh-portable66 if you require
  the use of one of the optional ports.

  AUTHOR: woodsb02@gmail.com

  The default MediaBrowser database/configuration/logs/media metadata
  storage directory has moved from /usr/local/mediabrowser to
  /var/db/mediabrowser. Users are advised either to move the contents of
  the old directory to the new location, or to add a mediabrowser_data_dir
  entry to /etc/rc.conf.

	# pkg delete -f kde-runtime-4\*

20141008:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby19
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 1.9 to 2.0.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 1.9 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 1.9 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=1.9

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby20 lang/ruby19
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.0

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby ruby-iconv portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby19:lang/ruby20
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.0.\* -fr lang/ruby20

  Due to the way pkg works please note that the configuration
  variables MAILDROP_SUID and MAILDROP_SGID, despite keeping their
  old names, are now required to contain a valid username and
  groupname existing on the system in which the package will be
  installed, while in the past numeric uids and gids worked fine.

  Wrong values will cause pkg to skip installing the setuid binaries
  on the system.

  Please check your configuration.

  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/calibre
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The dependency on graphics/py-imaging in calibre has been changed

  AFFECTS: users of net/foreman-proxy
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  In version 1.6 Foreman Smart Proxy splits its configuration into multiple
  ruby files located in PREFIX/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d.
  The configuration of each service (dhcp, dhs, bmc, etc.) has been moved
  into a dedicated file.

  You can use a bundled script to convert your old settings to new settings:
  PREFIX/share/foreman/extra/migrate_settings.rb

20140926:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Bash supports a feature of exporting functions in the environment with
  export -f.  Running bash with exported functions in the environment will
  then import those functions into the environment of the script being ran.
  This resulted in security issues CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169, commonly
  known as "shellshock".  It also can result in poorly written scripts being
  tricked into running arbitrary commands.

  To fully mitigate against this sort of attack we have applied a non-upstream
  patch to disable this functionality by default.  You can execute bash
  with --import-functions to allow it to import functions from the
  environment.  The default can also be changed in the port by selecting the
  IMPORTFUNCTIONS option.

20140926:
  AFFECTS: users of net/asterisk and net/asterisk11
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The asterisk ports have been modified to have the LUA option
  turned on by default to make such functionality available to users
  of binary packages.

  Some care should be taken before upgrading by people not using Lua
  to avoid the sample extensions.lua file from being loaded on reload
  after updating the asterisk port/pkg.

  Users compiling from ports not interested in LUA support are advised
  to disable the option before updating.

  People using binary packages(or not wanting to disable the LUA
  option in the port) not using the Lua functionality should add:

	noload => pbx_lua.so

  to the PREFIX/etc/asterisk/modules.conf file, if using the
  autoload=yes option in that same file. People not autoloading
  modules don't need to perform any special action.

  If asterisk is rebooted and the pbx_lua module gets loaded on a
  system were it should not, it will load the example extensions.lua
  configuration file adding unexpected logic to your dialplan. In
  such a case following the above steps and reloading asterisk will
  fix the problem.

  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-f10 and emulators/linux_base-c6
  AUTHOR: xmj@FreeBSD.org

  The complete drop-in replacement linux-c6 port infrastructure is in
  ports and will shortly replace the current linux-f10- ports as default.

  To switch to the linux-c6 infrastructure:

  0. Back up all your vital information!
  1. Remove the current linux base port and all linux-f10- ports:
       # pkg delete -f linux_base-f10 linux-f10-\*
  2. Add these lines to /etc/make.conf:
       OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=c6
       OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=c6
  3. Make sure no Linux application is running.
  4. Update the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf:
       compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18
     Make it take effect immediately:
       # sysctl compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18
  5. Install emulators/linux-c6.

  These steps are usually sufficient. If there are difficulties, expand
  step 1 to:

  1a. Remove all ports which depend on the linux base port.
  1b. Remove the linux base port.
  1c. Clean the /compat/linux/ directory.

  If there are any other difficulties not fixed by these extended steps,
  please submit an issue report in Bugzilla and send an email to
  FreeBSD's emulation@ mailing list.

  AFFECTS: users seeing build errors about missing *.la files
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  We are in the process of adjusting or, if possible, removing libtool archives
  (*.la files) from all ports because they can otherwise cause overlinking
  between packages.  This is the problem where in the dependency chain A->B->C
  an extra link is added from A to C even if A does not use C directly.  This
  makes some updates to port C expensive because then both A and B have to be
  rebuilt instead of just B.

  This is mostly behind the scenes work that you won't notice.  In fact most
  ports have already been converted.  You may however run into build errors
  about missing *.la files if a port update in the past went wrong and left
  behind *.la files with references to other *.la files that are no longer
  there.  In this case, please run the following command:

  find /usr/local/lib -name '*.la' | xargs grep -l 'libfoo\.la' | xargs pkg which
  (Replace libfoo\.la with the *.la file that is missing.)

  This command will print a list of *.la files that refer to the missing *.la
  file and what package they belong to.  First, where it says "not found in
  the database", remove the *.la file.  After removing all such files, where
  it says "installed by package X", rebuild X.  Eventually the list printed by
  that command will be empty and the build error should be gone.

  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/pkg, ports-mgmt/pkg-devel
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Pkg has been updated to 1.3.7. This fixes registration and tracking of
  shared libraries. All earlier versions of Pkg incorrectly marked some
  shared libraries and used the wrong name for some.

  Please note announcement for special instructions at:
    http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports-announce/2014-August/000086.html

  - Users need to run 'pkg update -f' and 'pkg check -Ba' after upgrading to
    pkg-1.3.7 and before updating any other packages. This avoids needing to
    reinstall anything not needed due to changed shlibs.
     For binary package users:
      # pkg install ports-mgmt/pkg
      # pkg update -f
      # pkg check -Ba
      # pkg upgrade
     For port users:
      # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg build deinstall install clean
      # pkg check -Ba
  - People building packages for serving to other systems need to rebuild
    all packages with 1.3.7.

  libjpeg-turbo installs its own unique library (libturbojpeg.so) and
  a drop-in replacement for libjpeg.so. The drop-in replacement has been
  split off into graphics/jpeg-turbo; libjpeg-turbo now installs only
  libturbojpeg.so.

  If you were using the libjpeg.so from graphics/libjpeg-turbo, you
  should install graphics/jpeg-turbo AFTER upgrading the libjpeg-turbo
  port.

  AFFECTS: users of TeXLive
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  TeXLive in Ports Collection has been updated to TL2014.

  When upgrading print/texlive-base on a system which has
  TL2012 packages, the following error may occur:

  pkg-static: texlive-base-20140525 conflicts with texlive-texmf-20120701_4

  Please remove texlive-texmf-20120701_4 first in that case.

  If you still get a similar "conflict of install files" error,
  please remove all of tex-* and texlive-* packages and then
  see if ${PREFIX}/share/texmf-dist directory are empty.  If not,
  installing TeXlive can fail.  Removing files in the directory
  manually will fix the installation problem.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/db4, databases/db4[1-7]*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  HEADS UP: for some applications that store their data in Berkeley DB
  databases, you may have to export the data before the upgrade and
  reload it afterwards.  Detailed instructions are at
  <https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/BerkeleyDBCleanup>.

  The older databases/db4* ports providing versions 4.0 to 4.7
  inclusively have been removed, and 4.8 has been deprecated.
  The default Berkeley DB version is now 5.3.
  (6.x has a different license, but will be eligible as default on
  systems that build ports from source and have db6 installed.)
    All enabled and working ports have been changed such that they use
  Berkeley DB 4.8 or newer, and an -exp run has been made.

  After you have performed the first steps from the Wiki documentation,
  and have arrived at a step that reads "build all applications", then
  type as privileged user and without the hash sign:

  # Tools/scripts/BDB-upgrade-helper.sh

  The helper script requires that ports-mgmt/portmaster or
  .../portupgrade is installed, will try to upgrade your applications
  with either of these tools (portmaster preferred), and if that succeeds,
  it will attempt to delete the packages if confirmed interactively.

20140815:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/ilmbase and graphics/OpenEXR
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The OpenEXR and ilmbase (Industrial Light and Magic) shared object
  names have changed.  You must rebuild all packages that require either
  of these libraries, by using one of these commands:

  # portmaster -r ilmbase -r OpenEXR
    or
  # portupgrade -fr graphics/ilmbase graphics/OpenEXR

  The PORTREVISIONs of all ports that require ilmbase and/or OpenEXR
  have been bumped.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler has been updated to version
  7.8.3 and Haskell Platform to 2014.2.0.0.  Hence it is recommended to
  rebuild or reinstall all the dependent ports and the lang/ghc port
  itself by one of the following commands:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc

  If you use pkg(8) then it is just safer to remove all the GHC-dependent
  packages along with GHC and reinstall everything from scratch.
  Something alone these lines may work:

  # pkg query "%ro" > ghc-pkgs.txt
  # pkg delete -y lang/ghc
  # pkg install -y `cat ghc-pkgs.txt | grep -Ev "/hs-(haskeline|terminfo|transformers|xhtml)"

  IMPORTANT: Perform a backup of the ajaxplorer installation and
  the databases backing it(if you're using that feature).

  First manually remove the ajaxplorer port and install www/pydio
  afterwards.

  Further steps will be available in the pkg-message, which can
  be shown with these commands:

	# pkg info -D pydio

  AFFECTS: users of databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Oracle Berkeley DB 6 has been upgraded to version 6.1.19.  Since the
  previous 6.0 version, the log file format has changed in 6.1.
  Depending on applications used, you may need to take action BEFORE you
  upgrade.  For details, please see the online upgrade manual at
  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_04/html/upgrading/upgrade_process.html>
  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_04/html/installation/upgrade_61_toc.html>

  Note: if you've got Apache installed and depending on db6, you may
  need to upgrade it separately BEFORE upgrading other ports, such as
  Apache modules.

  After that, you must rebuild all applications that link to db6 because
  the shared library name has changed with the upgrade.  To do that:

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -w -r db6-
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr databases/db6

20140714:

  It is no longer possible to specify the location of the gpg binary at
  buildtime to differentiate between version 1.x and version 2.x.  The port
  options GNUPG1 and GNUPG2 now merely add their respective versions of gnupg
  as build and runtime dependencies.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/m17n-* textproc/*m17n*
  AUTHOR: Nikola Lecic <nikola.lecic@anthesphoria.net>

  devel/m17n-db now incorporates a set of user-contributed input methods and

  Delete textproc/m17n-contrib first and then update/install devel/m17n-db.

20140616:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion
  AUTHOR: lev@FreeBSD.org

  The subversion port has been overhauled. Some optional parts were extracted
  into separate ports. These ports are:

  www/mod_dav_svn
    instead of option MOD_DAV_SVN.
  security/subversion-gnome-keyring
    instead of option GNOME_KEYRING.
  security/subversion-kwallet
    instead of option KDE_KWALLET.

  If you used devel/subversion with one (or more) of these non-standard
  options, you should install the appropriate port(s) after upgrading
  subversion.

  "mod_dontdothat" is installed unconditionally by www/mod_dav_svn port (it
  depended on the TOOLS option before), but is not activated by default, you
  may need to edit apache's configuration file.

  The devel/subversion port now installs svndiff, svndiff3 and svndiff4
  commands if TOOLS option is enabled. They was skipped before.
  The official names "diff", "diff3" and "diff4" are prefixed with "svn" to
  avoid conflicts with base and other diff versions.

  All libraries and binaries are now stripped if the MAINTAINER_DEBUG
  option is not selected (including all sub-ports, like bindings
  and mod_dav_svn).

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba4 port now re-uses the same logic and startup script as Samba41. So,
  to get net/samba4 runing you need to rename samba4_enable in /etc/rc.conf
  to the samba_sever_enable.

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140416:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg graphics/dri graphics/libGL and related ports
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD 10-STABLE and
  FreeBSD 9-STABLE.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg ports but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg
  distribution.

  For users in need of working console when using KMS drivers (intel and
  radeon graphics cards) please use the new vt(9) console driver.
  For more information, see https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics and
  https://wiki.freebsd.org/Newcons .

  To update:

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
    followed by
  # portmaster graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    or
  # portupgrade graphics/dri graphics/libGL

  lang/dmd and lang/dmd2 have switched places. Dmd 1.x is no longer supported
  by digitalmars.com and is now the secondary dmd port in the collection.
  Dmd2 is the primary port. What this means to dmd users is that dmd1 is now
  used to invoke dmd 1.x and the dmd command (instead of dmd2) now invokes
  dmd 2.x.

20140413:
  AFFECTS: users of Python and pkg >= 1.2.7_1
  AUTHOR: koobs@FreeBSD.org

  There have been reports of the following error when upgrading Python ports:

    pkg-static: Plist error, directory listed as a file: <name>.egg-info

  The cause is an outdated or unpatched version of setuptools or distribute
  installed by the user, or leftover from previous upgrades being used during
  the `setup.py install` phase. pkg >= 1.2.7_1 now generates an error where
  previously it did not.

  Users should inspect their ${LOCALBASE}/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages
  directory, and remove any entries that reference versions of
  setuptools or distribute *not* provided by ports or packages.

  Examples of entries that may be removed are:

    1) distribute-0.6.35-py2.7.egg
    2) setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg
    3) *Any* version of setuptools directly from PyPI via pip or easy_install

  The Apache PHP module has been separated from the main PHP port.
  If you had the APACHE OPTION selected, you have to perform the
  following steps:

  1) update your lang/php* options (i.e. 'make config')
  2) rebuild lang/php* port
  3) install www/mod_php* port

  It is *mandatory* to build both ports with the same DEBUG and ZTS
  options, so if you have a threaded Apache (i.e. worker or event MPM)
  you have to select the ZTS option in lang/php* port.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/py-setuptools dependent ports
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  devel/py-setuptools is being used for every python ports (if USE_PYDISTUTILS
  defined) since r336553. Due to PKGORIGIN limitation, we cannot build one
  python port with python27 and the other with python33 since they require
  different setuptools versions which have same PKGORIGIN. With the addition
  of py-setuptools{27,32,33}, we could now have py27-foo and py33-bar coexist
  in one system.

  Note that this is only a short-term solution. It does not help if you need
  coexistence of one port with different python versions, e.g. py27-foo and
  py33-foo.

  Please rebuild all ports that depend on devel/py-setuptools and use
  devel/py-setuptools{27,32,33} instead.

  XX represents python version (27, 32 or 33) in the following steps.

  pkgng users:

  # pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools:devel/py-setuptoolsXX

       pkg set -o lang/perl5.12:lang/perl5.16

    2) Upgrade perl and all dependencies:
       pkg install -Rf lang/perl5.16

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
       pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.16):
       portupgrade -o lang/perl5.16 -f lang/perl5.12

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
       portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.12

    Conservative:
      portmaster p5-

    Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
      portmaster -r perl-

    Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port specify the name of
      the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.  Also, depending on when
      perl 5.12 was installed last, the prefix may be perl-, perl5- or
      perl5.12-.

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/zabbix*
  AUTHOR: koobs@FreeBSD.org

  The login shell for the zabbix user in UIDs was changed from
  /usr/sbin/nologin to /bin/sh to fix the zabbix-agent UserParameter
  feature.

  To update the existing user on your system, run:

  # pw usermod zabbix -s /bin/sh

  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_authnz_external
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  www/mod_authnz_external was moved to www/mod_authnz_external22
  Please do the following according to package manager used.

  # portmaster -o www/mod_authnz_external22 www/mod_authnz_external
    or

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba41
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  With the introduction of Samba 4.1 corresponding port lost SWAT support
  and made WINBIND support mandatory. As samba4 introduced additional 'samba'
  daemon to the tripplet of nmbd/smbd/winbindd to avoid confusion startup
  script for samba41 was renamed to 'samba_server'. To start the whole band
  up it's enough to add to the rc.conf:

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140112:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libical
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The libical port was updated to 1.0.0. Due to the shared library bump
  and the removal of the .la file, all ports that use libical need to be
  rebuilt.

  # portmaster -r libical
   or
  # portupgrade -fr libical
   or
  # pkg install -fR libical

20140111:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/go
  AUTHOR: jlaffaye@FreeBSD.org

  Third party Go packages installed via the ports tree are no longer installed
  in GOROOT (PREFIX/go) but in a specific path: PREFIX/share/go

  Affected ports had their PORTREVISION bumped.
  To reinstall these packages via the ports tree, it is needed to deinstall
  them first (the build will fail if the `go` command detects that they
  already exists in GOROOT).

  If you are using these third party Go packages for local Go development,
  you have to add this new path to your GOPATH environment variable.

  AFFECTS: users of Qt 4 ports
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  Qt 4 ports framework has been reworked, several ports have been renamed.
  To ease upgrading run the following set of commands:

  # pkg set -o devel/qt4-declarative:x11-toolkits/qt4-declarative
  # pkg set -o devel/qt4-qtestlib:devel/qt4-testlib
  # pkg set -o textproc/qt4-clucene:textproc/clucene-qt4

  AFFECTS: users of archivers/p7zip
  AUTHOR: rakuco@FreeBSD.org

  The MINIMAL and MODULES options have been removed from archivers/p7zip,
  which now unconditionally installs the 7z, 7za and 7zr, as if the MINIMAL
  option was previously unset.

  The RAR decompression codec, whose source code has a more restrictive
  license that forbids its use for creating RAR archives, has been moved to
  a separate port, archivers/p7zip-codec-rar.

  AUTHOR: ume@FreeBSD.org

  The SASL GSSAPI authentication plugin was removed from
  security/cyrus-sasl2 port and divided into new
  security/cyrus-sasl2-gssapi port.

  If you are using the SASL GSSAPI authentication, please install
  security/cyrus-sasl2-gssapi port, in addition to upgrading
  security/cyrus-sasl2 port.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/ruby-bdb or ports-mgmt/portupgrade and databases/db5 or databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  databases/db5 and databases/db6 have recently been updated to fix
  bugs. This changed their patchlevel version.

  However, ruby-bdb used to break during the db[56] upgrade due to a bug
  described in <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=184921>.

  THEREFORE, YOU MUST MANUALLY UPGRADE databases/ruby-bdb INDIVIDUALLY
  TO 0.6.6_2 OR NEWER WHEN USING portupgrade AGAINST databases/db[56]
  PORTS. To achieve that, type:

  # portupgrade databases/ruby-bdb
  or
  # portmaster -x 'db*' databases/ruby-bdb

  before proceeding with other upgrades.

  Should you have corrupted the portupgrade databases, or if ruby-bdb
  refuses to work with the upgraded db* port with errors such as "DB
  needs compatible versions of libdb & db.h", then rebuild the ruby-bdb
  port manually, and fix the portupgrade databases:

  # make -C /usr/ports/databases/ruby-bdb all deinstall install clean
  # pkgdb -fu
  # portupgrade -f db5 db6

  This should return portupgrade to normal operation.

  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg, graphics/libGL, graphics/dri, all xorg ports
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD CURRENT.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg port but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg
  distribution.

  To update:

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
    followed by
  # portmaster graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    or
  # portupgrade graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    and then
  # portmaster -a
    or
  # portupgrade -a

20131216:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db4*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Berkeley DB versions before and excluding 4.8 have been marked deprecated.
  New port installations should be based on Berkeley DB 5 or 6.

  Note that Oracle Berkeley DB 6 is under the more restrictive Affero GPL v3
  license, be sure to review if using that fits your requirements.

  You can add WITH_BDB_VER=5 or WITH_BDB_VER=6 to /etc/make.conf to have all
  applications that get rebuilt use Oracle Berkeley DB 5 or 6, respectively.

  DO NOT FORCE DELETE older BerkeleyDB packages, that breaks the upgrade
  tools.  Instead, first rebuild the ports that depend on it, then
  remove the old Berkeley DB versions.

  Berkeley DB ports should be able to build/install with an older and a
  newer version version both installed if WITH_BDB_VER is set.  If a
  port then grabs the old Berkeley DB version, that is an issue with the
  port that requires Berkeley DB, and should be reported to the
  maintainer.

  If you are interested in upgrading now already, we have instructions
  at <https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/BerkeleyDBCleanup>.
