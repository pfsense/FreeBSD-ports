The Elasticsearch Module for Icinga Web 2 integrates your Elastic stack into
Icinga Web 2. Based on Elasticsearch instances and event types you configure,
the module allows you to display data collected by Beats, Logstash and any
other source. After you've installed and configured the module, you can browse
events via the host action Elasticsearch Events.
