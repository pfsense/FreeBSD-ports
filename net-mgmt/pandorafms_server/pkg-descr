Pandora FMS is a monitoring Open Source software. It watches your systems and
applications, and allows you to know the status of any element of those systems.

any value of the NASDAQ new technology market. Pandora FMS could send out SMS

platform, gathering data and sending it to a server, it has specific agents for

factors such as temperature, or application values like strings contained in
web pages or any possible way to collect data in an automatic way.
