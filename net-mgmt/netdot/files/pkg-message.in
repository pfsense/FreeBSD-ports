1. If you do not already have a Site.conf configuration file, you will need
to create one.  Simply copy %%WWWDIR%%/etc/Default.conf
to Site.conf and edit to suit.

2. New installations will need to run the following commands:

cd %%WWWDIR%%/bin/
./initdb initdb

This command assumes that you have created a customised Site.conf
configuration file.

3. Upgrading?  Back up your database first, then run the following commands:

cd %%WWWDIR%%/upgrade/
perl updatedb

This command assumes that you have created a customised Site.conf
configuration file.

4. Please see %%WWWDIR%%/etc/netdot.cron
in the root directory of the installation package for suggestions on
what should be added to your server's crontab.

5. Suggested Apache configuration files are available here:

%%WWWDIR%%/etc/netdot_apache2_local.conf
%%WWWDIR%%/etc/netdot_apache2_ldap.conf

6. Running Apache 2.4?  Make sure that both the mod_perl and mod_apreq2 have
been added to httpd.conf:

LoadModule perl_module		libexec/apache24/mod_perl.so
LoadModule apreq_module		libexec/apache24/mod_apreq2.so

Note that any changes to Site.conf require an apache reload.
