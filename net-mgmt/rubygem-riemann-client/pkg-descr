Submit custom events and query aggregated events across all your
infrastructure, using Riemann, a powerful real-time event stream
processor for monitoring all your distributed systems.

Only plain UDP and TCP connections are provided, TLS is not available.
Thus, either use a TLS proxy (haproxy or nginx), or a tool such as
spiped, to add encryption to your Riemann servers.
