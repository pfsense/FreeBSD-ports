YAF is Yet Another Flowmeter. It processes packet data from pcap(3)
dumpfiles as generated by tcpdump(1) or via live capture from an
interface using pcap(3) into bidirectional flows, then exports those
flows to IPFIX Collecting Processes or in an IPFIX-based file format.
YAF's output can be used with the SiLK flow analysis tools and any
other IPFIX compliant toolchain.
