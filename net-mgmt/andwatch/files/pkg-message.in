Before using ANDwatch, you must create the MAC Address database. The
The MAC Address database is created with the following command:

    %%PREFIX%%/bin/andwatch-update-ma

It is generally a good idea to update the MAC Address database on a
periodic basis to incorporate new address assignments. This update
can be done via cron. Here is an example cron entry to update the
MAC Address database once per month:

    0 0 1 * * root /usr/bin/nice -n20 %%PREFIX%%/bin/andwatch-update-ma

Note that the database update is performed live, and andwatchd does
not need to be stopped in order to run the update.
