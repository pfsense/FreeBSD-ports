  message: <<EOM
SmokePing has now been installed in %%PREFIX%%/smokeping/.

NOTE: A set of sample configuration files have been installed in
%%ETCDIR%%.

You *MUST* edit these to suit your requirements. Please read the
manpages 'smokeping_install' and 'smokeping_config' for further
details on installation and configuration.

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Smokeping, the
manpage 'smokeping_upgrade' may be of help.

Once configured, you can start SmokePing by adding:

  smokeping_enable="YES"

to /etc/rc.conf, and then running, as root:

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/smokeping start

For configuration of web access, please see the 'smokeping_install'
manpage.

Enjoy!
