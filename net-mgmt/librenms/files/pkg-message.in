  message: <<EOM

You can mostly follow the guide at:
http://docs.librenms.org/

with the following notes:
- Installation directory is %%WWWDIR%%

NOTE: setting sql-mode="" is no longer required. You can remove
it from %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/mysql/my.cnf

However, 'lower_case_table_names=0' is required.

HEADS UP

Polling via cron job has been removed.. Please use the Dispatcher.

LibreNMS will be dropped support for PHP 7.1 and Python 2
see https://community.librenms.org/t/dropping-support-for-php-7-1-and-python-2/11851

Your existing crontab entries are no longer useful and should be deleted.

Enable the poller service with this command:

sysrc librenms_enable="YES"

The service will log to /var/log/librems/librenms-service.log

see also https://docs.librenms.org/Extensions/Dispatcher-Service/

For log file rotation

* sample file installed to %%WWWDIR%%/contrib/newsyslog.conf.sample
* actual file installed, never overwriting, to %%PREFIX%%/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/librenms.conf

When converting from PYPOLLER to the Dispatcher Service (PYSERVICE),
these steps will help you get started:

* compile with PYSERVICE enabled and PYPOLLER disabled
* comment out the crontab entries listed above under PYPOLLER
* populate %%WWWDIR%%/.env with:
  * APP_KEY - see farther below for how to create
  * NODE_ID - see just below for how to create
  * DB_HOST
  * DB_DATABASE
  * DB_USERNAME
  * DB_PASSWORD
* you can create a NODE_ID with: php -r 'echo uniqid() . "\n";'

When setting up a new install, you need a %%WWWDIR%%/.env file.

To create:

cd %%WWWDIR%%
cp -i .env.example .env

That file will eventually contain secrets.  Make sure it is not world-readable.

Database connection details are required in that file.

Then run:

sudo php artisan key:generate

It should write directly to your .env file

The output should look something like this:

$ sudo php artisan key:generate
Application key set successfully.

When migrating to PYSERVICE (also known as the Dispatcher Service):

It is also a good idea to:
cd %%WWWDIR%%
sudo ./validate.php

You need an APP_KEY.


After that, follow the LibreNMS documentation for configuration.

You probably want to install lang/python3 to get validate.php clean.

EOM
}
{ type: upgrade
  message: <<EOM
Depending on the version, you may have to run the upgrade script.

cd %%WWWDIR%%
./build-base.php

Or the database upgrade script:

./lnms migrate
