Notes:

 * See the documentation at https://mathias-kettner.com/checkmk_livestatus.html

 * Requires Nagios (net-mgmt/nagios, or net-mgmt/nagios4) be built with event
   broker support enabled, or 'livestatus.o' will never be loaded. This is
   the default for net-mgmt/nagios4.

 * unixcat (for use with reading from the socket and/or inetd(8) support)
   moved from %%PREFIX%%/bin to %%PREFIX%%/lib/mk-livestatus
   in order to avoid a conflict with sysutils/ucspi-unix

 * livecheck was removed in 1.2.3.i5. Please adjust your "broker_module=..."
   directive in %%PREFIX%%/etc/nagios/nagios.cfg!
