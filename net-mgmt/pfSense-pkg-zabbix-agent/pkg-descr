Zabbix agent is deployed on a monitoring target to actively monitor local
resources and applications (hard drives, memory, processor statistics etc).

The agent gathers operational information locally and reports data to Zabbix
server for further processing. In case of failures (such as a hard disk running
full or a crashed service process), Zabbix server can actively alert the
administrators of the particular machine that reported the failure.

Zabbix is an enterprise-class open source distributed monitoring solution.
