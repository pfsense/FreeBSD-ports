 Message encryption / CLI version

If the messaging between server/client should be encrypted, one will require a
certificate and a key otherwise the program will throw an exception and exits.

Generate a certificate with the following command:

$ openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout napalm-logs.key -out napalm-logs.crt -days 365

If no encryption is required, please read further below how to start the server
without a certificate.


 Starting the server / CLI version

a) with encrypted messaging:

# napalm-logs-%%PYTHON_VER%% --certificate napalm-logs.cert --keyfile napalm-logs.key

b) with unencrypted messaging:

# napalm-logs-%%PYTHON_VER%% --disable-security

In both cases the server will listen on

	0.0.0.0:514 [UDP / incoming syslog messages]
	0.0.0.0:49017 [TCP / incoming client requests]

In case a) when security is enabled, the server will listen also on:

	0.0.0.0:49018 [TCP / incoming authentication requests]  

Please read https://napalm-logs.readthedocs.io/en/latest for further
information.
