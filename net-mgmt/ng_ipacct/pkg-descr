The ng_ipacct is Netgraph IP accounting node intended to gather
IP traffic informations.

IP accounting is collected in both simple and extended modes.
Output format is similar to the one used in Cisco IOS (command
"show ip accounting").

In simple mode output format is:
    ip_from ip_to packets bytes

and in verbose mode:
    ip_from s_port ip_to d_port proto packets bytes

Also, effective user ID of relevant process and timestamp can be saved.

CPU overhead is minimal because ng_ipacct works at kernel level.
