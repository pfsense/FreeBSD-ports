The Net::IP::Match::XS module efficiently matches IP addresses against
IP ranges.  The unconditionally exported subroutine 'match_ip'
determines if the ip to match ( first argument ) matches any of the
subsequent ip arguments.  Match arguments may be absolute quads, as
'127.0.0.1', or contain mask bits as '111.245.76.248/29'.
