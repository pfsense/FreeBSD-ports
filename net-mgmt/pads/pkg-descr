PADS is a signature based detection engine used to passively detect
network assets. It is designed to complement IDS technology by
providing context to IDS alerts.

Goals:

* Passive: Records and identifies traffic seen on a network without
    actively "scanning" a system. There will never be a packet sent
    from the pads applications.

* Portable: Has the ability to be placed easily on a remote system.
    Does not require additional external libraries other than those
    associated with libpcap.

* Lightweight: Logging is sent to a simple CSV file. There is no need
    for a database or other data repository installed on the local
    machine. All correlation is done outside of the pads program.
