To improve bgpq4 performance when expanding extra-large AS-SETs OS settings needs to be tuned to enlarge TCP send buffer.

To enlarge TCP send buffer, run the following:

# sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_max=2097152

To make it persistent across reboots, add the following to /etc/sysctl.conf:

net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_max=2097152
