NSCA-ng provides a client-server pair which makes the Nagios command file
accessible to remote systems. This allows for submitting passive check
results, downtimes, and many other commands to Nagios or compatible
monitoring solutions. The submitted data is queued by the NSCA-ng
server if Nagios goes down. Multiple check results or commands can be
submitted in one go, and multiline plugin output is fully supported.
NSCA-ng uses TLS encryption and shared-secret authentication with
per-client passwords, as well as fine-grained authorization control.

This package contains the NSCA-ng server, which is written in C and
uses an event-driven architecture. Disk I/O is avoided unless the data
cannot be submitted in one go due to its size (on Linux, the threshold
is 4kB). In this case, the data is handed over to Nagios via
asynchronously written files.

NSCA clients cannot talk to NSCA-ng servers (nor vice versa), but NSCA
and NSCA-ng servers can happily run side by side.
