To start blackbox_exporter, create a configuration file at
%%PREFIX%%/etc/blackbox_exporter.yml and run
"sysrc blackbox_exporter_enable=yes".

For details about the configuration file format, visit
https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/blob/%%GH_TAGNAME%%/CONFIGURATION.md

Since blackbox_exporter allows setting arbitrary probe
targets via HTTP parameters, it is set to listen on localhost
only by default. To change the listen address, set the
blackbox_exporter_listen_address rcvar.

To use the 'ping' module, blackbox_exporter needs to run with
root privileges. To run blackbox_exporter with root privileges,
run "sysrc blackbox_exporter_user=root".

By default, blackbox exporter will log via syslog.  Examples for
controlling which log file and setting up log rotation may be found in:
