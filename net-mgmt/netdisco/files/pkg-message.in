  message: <<EOM
to get Netdisco running, you just have to:
 * edit %%ETCDIR%%/environments/deployment.yml to suit your needs
   (https://github.com/netdisco/netdisco/wiki/Configuration)
 * edit rc.conf according to %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/netdisco
 * have a look at https://metacpan.org/pod/App::Netdisco
   note that ~/environments is replaced here by %%ETCDIR%%/environments
 * launch netdisco-deploy *as user netdisco* to install/upgrade your database
     su - netdisco -c "netdisco-deploy"
 * copy (or link) %%ETCDIR%%/netdiscologs.conf
   to %%PREFIX%%/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/ to take care
   of logs rotation
    ln -s %%ETCDIR%%/netdiscologs.conf %%PREFIX%%/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/netdiscologs.conf

Always use "su - netdisco" or "sudo -l -u netdisco" before running netdisco-do or
  any netdisco-* command (because of locallib use)
If running with another user or missing HOME variable (eg: sudo without -l) you
  need NETDISCO_HOME=%%ETCDIR%% environment variable
