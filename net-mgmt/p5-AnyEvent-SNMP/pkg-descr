This module implements an alternative "event dispatcher" for Net::SNMP, using
AnyEvent as a backend.

It integrates Net::SNMP into AnyEvent: You can make non-blocking Net::SNMP
calls and as long as other parts of your program also use AnyEvent (or some
event loop supported by AnyEvent) and they will run in parallel.
