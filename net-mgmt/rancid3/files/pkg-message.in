For further configuration information please look at
%%PREFIX%%/share/rancid/README.

If you are upgrading from the previous version of rancid look at
%%PREFIX%%/share/rancid/UPGRADING.

If you would like to set up Rancid to be browseable from Web,
you need to install devel/cvsweb or devel/viewvc.

For rancid looking-glass copy the actual CGIs (located at
%%PREFIX%%/libexec/rancid/{lg.cgi lgform.cgi}) to your cgi-bin.

Schedule rancid-run with cron at your desired interval or add
hourly_rancid_enable="YES" to /etc/periodic.conf for automatic hourly
runs. Note, you'll need to enable an hourly job in /etc/crontab:

0       *       *       *       *       root    periodic hourly
