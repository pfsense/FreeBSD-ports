Nitpicker is a free IP flow accounter.  It started because the commercial
accounting software was just not fast, precise and reliable enough to fit
today's ISP/MSP requirements.

Here are some of the large benefits of nitpicker:

  - 100% free, in public domain
  - Designed for speed
  - Designed to run reliably under djb's daemontools
  - Consumes minimal processor power
  - Runs within little memory
  - Does not banally summarize the traffic
  - Stores all relevant traffic data for comprehensible interaction
