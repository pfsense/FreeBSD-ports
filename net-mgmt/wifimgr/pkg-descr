wifimgr is a GTK+-based GUI for management of WiFi networks on BSD systems.
It acts as an interface to the existing /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf networks
configuration file, and supports WEP and WPA-PSK security.

wifimgr was designed for users of the XFce4 window manager but will work
in any environment with GTK+ libraries installed.
