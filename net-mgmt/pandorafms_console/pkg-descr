Pandora FMS Console is a web application to manage Pandora FMS.
Console allows to see graphical reports, state of every agent,
also to access to the information sent by the agent, to see every
monitored parameter and to see its evolution throughout the time, to
form the different nodes, groups and users of the system. It is the
part that interacts with the final user, and that will allows you to
administer the system.
