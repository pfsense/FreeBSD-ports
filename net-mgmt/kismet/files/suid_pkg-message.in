kismet has been installed with a setuid-root capture helper binary,
%%LOCALBASE%%/bin/kismet_capture, which may be executed by users in the
kismet group.  USERS IN THIS GROUP WILL BE ABLE TO ALTER NETWORK
INTERFACE STATES, but this is more secure than running all of kismet
as root.  ONLY users in this group will be able to run kismet and capture
from physical network devices.
