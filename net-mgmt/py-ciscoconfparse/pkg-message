  message: <<EOD
Since the 1.4.2 release the behavior of "ip_helper_addresses()" function has
changed.  Parsing helper-addresses under factory=True won't work anymore as
expected.

Also the method named "find_objects_w_all_children()" has changed since the
1.4.0 release.  Former releases used the keyword "all_children" which has been
replaced with "recurse".

If you use one of those features mentioned above, please migrate your scripts
to the new format.
