# Note: Wildcard matches are only matched if there are NO exact matches.  This takes

#	only be used if there are no other exact matches.

# (which includes the local hosts file, depending on how the OS is configured).  This name
# will be used for: NODES entry matches, hostname field in logged traps (file / database),
