rcpd is a RCP server intended specifically for router
or network device clients. It is used to transfer
configurations, boot images, and kernels images
(eg: IOS) to the devices.

These files are often tranfered with TFTP, but TFTP
has reliability and speed issues and file size
limitations due to it's protocol specification and
underlying transport; while RCP is not affected.
