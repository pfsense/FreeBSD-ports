  message <<EEOOMM
ATTENTION: The mongodb dependency has been changed from 36 to 44, as MongoDB
3.6 is long out out support and end of life.

One of implications is that the instance MUST be restored from backup.

The upgrade path can be as following:

- Take a backup from within the unifi7 application PRIOR to
  updating!
 
- Stop the unifi7 service (if running)
 
- Copy the "backup" directory from %%LOCALBASE%%/share/java/unifi/data
  to a safe location. Also copy keystore and system.properties if
  you have made any modifications to those files
 
- Remove files and directories under %%LOCALBASE%%/share/java/unifi/data
 
- Upgrade the package
 
- Copy the "backup" directory from a safe location back to
  %%LOCALBASE%%/share/java/unifi/data
 
- Start the service
 
- Restore the configuration from backup

- Review system.properties and keystore to merge any manual
  modifications you have made (this has to be done with
  the application stopped)
