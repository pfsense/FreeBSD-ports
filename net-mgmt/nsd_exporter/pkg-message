Don't forget to run nsd-control-setup to generate the required
certificates and then ensure the user this process runs as can read them.

The default user is nobody.  You can change the user (or group) by running:
% sysrc nsd_exporter_user="user"
% sysrc nsd_exporter_group="group"

Be aware that any user with access to the certificates can run all of the
nsd-control commands.
