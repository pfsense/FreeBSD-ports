  message: <<EOD
Release 3.0.0 introduced support for the Arista FN 0039 command changes (Github
issue #1093), by replacing the old style commands with the new style commands.

This also affected the way NAPALM loads the configuration on the device (i.e.,
it would transform the configuration before loading).

In order to prevent this, and avoid unexpected results, a new optional argument
"eos_fn0039_config" was introduced, defaulting to "False", which can be used to
select whether NAPALM should convert the configuration command before loading.

By default, NAPALM won't transform the configuration, but setting the variable
"eos_fn0039_config" to "True" it would help one to transition to newer EOS
versions.
