Xymon is a system for monitoring servers and networks. It has a great deal
of inspiration from the Big Brother monitor, but unlike Big Brother it is
designed to work well whether you need to monitor small network with just
a handful of hosts, or large networks with thousands of hosts.

Xymon is the successor to the bbgen toolkit, which has been available as
an add-on to Big Brother since late 2002. The name change was decided upon
when Xymon acquired enough functionality to be a stand-alone product.
The tools that formed the bbgen toolkit are still present in Xymon
and are quite important for it, so if you have used bbgen before,
Xymon will seem quite familiar.

This is the server.
