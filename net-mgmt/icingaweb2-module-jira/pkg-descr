This module integrates an existing Jira installation in your Icinga Web 2
frontend.

Hassle-free deep integration with Atlassian Jira. Depending on your needs, this
module is able to:

* create JIRA Issues for Problems detected by Icinga
* create only one issue per problem
* acknowledge Icinga Problems once a JIRA issue has been created
* manually create Host- or Service-related JIRA issues
* shows a Host/Service-related JIRA Issue History

And there is more. Use custom templates to trigger JIRA Workflows according
your very own needs. This way you can automatically fill JIRA custom fields
based on monitored system properties. This feature is mostly being used to
assign monitored objects to their related CIs or to trigger dedicated
customer-related workflows.
