EtherPEG was a program that sniffed for JPEGs passing by on the AirPort
networks at MacHack, and showed them on the huge screen to shame people
into a) turning the 802.11 encryption on, or b) reducing amount of pr0n
they download at weirdo Mac conventions. DRIFTNET can do the same for
*your* office, and make an attractive desktop accessory to boot. The
program promiscuously sniffs and decodes any JPEG downloaded by anyone
on your LAN, displaying it in an attractive, ever changing mosaic of
fluffy kittens, oversized navigation buttons, and blurred images of Big
Brother Elizabeth fiddling. It's UNIX only. Your sysadmin is undoubtedly
running it already. So stop that. Now.
