Dickens is a simple, one-buffer-in-one-window, console text editor.

Dickens only understands UNIX-style text files expressed in ASCII, and is
therefore of little or no use to the non-English-speaking world.

Dickens is written in Munger(1).  Features include interactive filename
completion, tags support, regular-expression search-and-replace, and
unlimited undo/redo.
