Neovim is an aggressive refactor of editors/vim. It represents a
complete overhaul of the codebase with many sanity improvements,
including sensible defaults, a built-in terminal emulator,
asynchronous plugin architecture, and powerful APIs designed for
speed and extensibility. It retains full compatibility
with almost all Vim plugins and scripts.

For most users, Neovim is a drop-in Vim replacement.
