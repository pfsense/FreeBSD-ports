To use the sly-asdf contrib, you must:
1. Register sly-asdf into SLY. You just have to add this line to some init
   file:
(require 'sly-asdf)
   Doing this is not strictly necessary if you want to automatically activate
   this contrib using `sly-contribs' (see below), but it never hurts.
   This contrib's automatic activation at load was disabled, contrary to what
   upstream does.
2. Ensure that ASDF is loaded by your Common Lisp implementation.

If you want sly-asdf to be automatically activated on each new SLY
session, put it in the `sly-contribs' list. E.g., you can add something like
this in some Emacs' init file:
(setq sly-contribs '(sly-fancy sly-asdf))
or customize the variable.

To enable it on demand in already running SLY sessions instead, just use the
`sly-enable-contrib' command, or modify `sly-contribs' and run `sly-setup'.

NOTE: The experimental Flymake code has been elided from this port (it requires
dependencies that are not in ports currently).
