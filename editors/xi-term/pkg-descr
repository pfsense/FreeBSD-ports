Formely known as xi-tui, xi-term is a terminal frontend for the xi editor.

The xi editor project is an attempt to build a high quality text editor, using
modern software engineering techniques.

Goals include:
- Incredibly high performance.  All editing operations should commit
  and paint in under 16ms.  The editor should never make you wait for
  anything.
- Reliability.  Crashing, hanging, or losing work should never happen.
- Developer friendliness.  It should be easy to customize xi editor,
  whether by adding plug-ins or hacking on the core.
