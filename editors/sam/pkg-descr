Sam is a text editor originally written for the Blit graphical terminal
connected to a machine running 9th Edition Research Unix. It contained many
useful innovations, the most famous of which was its use of structural regular
expressions. This version of sam is based on that 1990s Unix port, with many
useful additions and modifications.
