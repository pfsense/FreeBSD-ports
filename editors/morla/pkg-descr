Morla is a RDF editor written in C. It is based on the libnxml and librdf
libraries. With Morla you can manage more RDF documents simultaneously,
visualize graphs and use templates for quick writing.

With Morla you can import RDFS documents and use their contents to write new
RDF triples. Templates are also RDF documents and they make Morla easily
personalizable and expandable.

You can also use Morla as a RDF navigator, wandering among the net knots of
the RDF documents present on Internet exactly as we are used to do with normal
browsers.
