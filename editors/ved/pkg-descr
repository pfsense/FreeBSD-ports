Ved is a fast and easy to learn screen oriented editor, that implements
no file size limits.  The user interface is somewhere between emacs and
vi and does not limit the work speed even of experienced users.

Ved has been inspired by an editor of the same name that appeared in
1980 as system editor on UNOS (the first UNIX clone).
