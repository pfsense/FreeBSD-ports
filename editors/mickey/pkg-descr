Mickey is a hexadecimal/ASCII file viewer and editor that runs on all
major operating systems thanks to FLTK.  It supports various integer
and floating-point data types, and allows to work with multiple files
simultaneously via well-known tabbed interface.  Unfortunately, there
is no support for editing of very large files yet.
