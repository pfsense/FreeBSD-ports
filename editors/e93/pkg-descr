e93 is a portable window based text editor oriented to the needs of
programmers.  It was begun in 1993 (thus the name).  It uses the mouse,
selections, cut/copy/paste, and closely follows the model of editors
on the Macintosh and NeXT platforms.

e93 supports columnar selection.  It achieves this by allowing multiple
pieces of the text to be selected simultaneously (this is perhaps its
most unique feature).

e93 imposes no limits on the line length, file length, or number of
simultaneous files which it can edit.

e93 is able to handle all 8-bit binary codes without complaint, or
confusion.

e93 is highly configurable without recompiling because scripts which
control the editor can be written in Tcl.

e93 supports user-configurable syntax highlighting.
