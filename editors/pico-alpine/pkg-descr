Pico and Pilot are simple, display-oriented tools.  Commands are displayed
at the bottom of the screen, and context-sensitive help is provided.

In Pico as characters are typed they are immediately inserted into the text.
It has three basic features: paragraph justification, searching, and block
cut/paste.

In Pilot several basic file manipulation commands are provided:
Delete, Rename, Copy, View, Launch, and Edit.  The "View" and "Edit"
commands operate on text files only.  The "Edit" command invokes "pico."
The "Launch" command provides a convenient way to either execute the selected
file or to run an application on it.
