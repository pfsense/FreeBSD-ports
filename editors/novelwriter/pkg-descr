novelWriter is a markdown-like text editor designed for writing novels and
larger projects of many smaller plain text documents.

It is designed to be a simple text editor that allows for easy organisation of
text files and notes, with a meta data syntax for comments, synopsis, and
cross-referencing between files, and built on plain text files for robustness.
