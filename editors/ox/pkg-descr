Ox is a code editor. It was written in Rust using ANSI escape sequences.
It assists developers with programming by providing several tools to speed up
and make programming easier and a refreshing alternative to heavily bloated
and resource hungry editors such as VS Code and JetBrains. Ox is lightweight
so it can be used on older computers.
