TECO is the grand old text editor.  It is a powerful and compact precursor
to EMACS, and has a completely nongraphical user interface.  It is very fast
(probably the fastest editor in the world) and has a macro language. TECO
was written by Dan Murphy (http://www.opost.com/dlm) at Digital Equipment
Corporation in 1962.  This is based on Pete Siemsen's TECOC implementation,
and comes with a copy of the original's DECUS TECO documentation.
