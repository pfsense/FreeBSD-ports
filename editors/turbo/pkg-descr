Turbo is an experimental text editor for the terminal, based on the
Scintilla editing component and the Turbo Vision application framework.

It aims at being intuitive and easy to use.  Usability and productivity
are its two other major objectives, although it has not got that far yet.
And only for being a Turbo Vision application, it offers a vintage look
and feel, while being fully Unicode/UTF-8 aware, including support for
CJK (wide) characters.
