The editor Python library allows users to open their default text
editor or a specified editor to edit existing files, new files, or
temporary files. It blocks execution while the user edits the text
and then returns the file's contents.

The library determines the editor to use based on the VISUAL or
EDITOR environment variables, or defaults to 'Notepad' on Windows
and 'vim' otherwise.
