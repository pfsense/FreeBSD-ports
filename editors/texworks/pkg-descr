The TeXworks project is an effort to build a simple TeX front-end program
(working environment) that will be available for all today's major desktop
operating systems.  It is deliberately modeled after Dick Koch's award-
winning TeXShop for Mac OS X.

TeXworks includes an integrated PDF viewer, based on the Poppler library,
and supports source/preview synchronization.  This capability is based on
the "SyncTeX" feature developed by Jerome Laurens, and supported by both
the pdfTeX and XeTeX programs in TeX Live, and other current distributions.
