Mined was the first text mode editor with Unicode support. It now has both
extensive Unicode and CJK support offering many specific features and
covering special cases that other editors are not aware of (like auto-
detection features and automatic handling of terminal variations).

And basically, it is an editor tailored to efficient editing of plain text
documents and programs, with features and interactive behaviour designed
for this purpose.
