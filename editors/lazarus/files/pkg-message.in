  message: <<EOM
The Lazarus RAD was installed

1) You can run it using:

   # lazarus

2) The first time that lazarus is running, you should set the path to fpc
   source directory at lazarus configuration environment. Also it could be
   setting later.

3) Now you can obtain freepascal source installing lang/fpc-source port or 
   package

   It will be extracted to %%LOCALBASE%%/share/fpc-source-X.X.X

4) You can use %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/gdb debugger instead of gdb installed debugger
   installed from base system. Lazarus works better with this version.

5) The lazbuild.cfg file has been removed, it is not necessary anymore. Now
   we can use the following ports for aplications that depend of lazarus
   and these can be built with an interface different than lazarus has compiled
   by default:

   editors/lazarus
   editors/lazarus-qt5

   You can added those ports if you want support for gtk2, or qt5
   interfaces. Please look at net-p2p/transmission-remote-gui like a example of
   how use it

6) Enjoy it ;)
EOM
