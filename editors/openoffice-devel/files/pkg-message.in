Apache OpenOffice Build %%AOOTAG%% Personal Install How-To

Written by:	Martin Blapp <mbr@freebsd.org>
		and Maho Nakata <maho@FreeBSD.org>

Apache OpenOffice %%AOOTAG%% will soon be installed in
%%PREFIX%%/%%EXECBASE%%

1. Scanner interface
--------------------
To enable the scanner interface, install the sane-backends package.

2. Spell checkers
-----------------
Dictionaries for various languages are available as packages.
They are named LANG-hunspell, where LANG can be "en", "es", "it" etc.
The corresponding ports are in the textproc category.

3. User installation
--------------------
Just type "%%EXECBASE%%" after you have successfully installed
the package.  If there is no installed .openoffice.org directory in your
home directory, the setup installs the "%%AOOUDIR%%" folder.

4. Starting Apache OpenOffice
-----------------------------
There are some wrappers installed for faster startup.  Add "%%PREFIX%%/bin/"
to your PATH and you will be able to use them.

%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-printeradmin
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sbase
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-scalc
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sdraw
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-simpress
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-smath
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-swriter

OpenOffice does need $LANG to be set to a suitable value.

5. If you run into problems
---------------------------
If you somehow run into problems, please remove the already installed
"%%AOOUDIR%%" directory in your home directory, then redo the
user installation and the problems should go away.

In general, it is always a good idea to do a backup of important
and personal data, so we recommend to always back up your OpenOffice
user profile before doing an upgrade to a newer release.

Users can back up their profile by copying this directory:
  /home/<user name>/.openoffice

  message: <<EOM
It is recommended to make a backup of the Apache OpenOffice users
profile before upgrading. It is especially essential for users who
use the Master Password functionality and may decide to use an older
version later. There is a change in the encoding of stored passwords
between the 4.1.2 and  4.1.13 releases (and in a similar timeframe
for the -devel port) that may make your user profile unusable for
previous versions.
