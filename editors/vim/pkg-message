  Vim no longer installs or reads a system-wide vimrc. The only overridden
  defaults are those which provide FreeBSD-specific settings. Read through
  $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim to see Vim's defaults, and see ':h initialization'
  for the standard locations Vim looks for configuration files.

  The Vim port no longer brings in python automatically. Instead, it is
  a dynloadable feature that can be enabled at runtime by installing python.

      # pkg add python3

  It will ONLY work with the version of python that the port was build with
  (i.e. the defualt python version). If you've changed it manually, and want
  python plugin, then you'll need to build and install the port locally.
