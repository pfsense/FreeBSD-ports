To enable autoloading of SLY, add this to some Emacs init file:
(require 'sly-autoloads)

You should specify some Lisp implementation. This works for both SLY and SLIME:
(setq inferior-lisp-program "path_to_your_lisp_binary")
SLY however has convenient specific variables for more complex
configurations. E.g.:
(setq sly-default-lisp 'sbcl
      sly-lisp-implementations '((sbcl ("sbcl"))))
Please see their documentation.

Contribs in `sly-contribs' list are automatically loaded and enabled (and those
not in it are disabled) each time a new session is launched, or `sly-setup' is
called. If you define `sly-contribs' in some initialization file, be sure to
include sly-fancy in it (instead, you can add to the list using `add-to-list',
after the `require' above).

If you just want to immediately enable a contrib, you can instead use
`sly-enable-contrib', but be aware that the effect will be temporary. It will
last up to the next connection established or `sly-setup' call, unless you add
the contrib to `sly-contribs' in the meantime.
