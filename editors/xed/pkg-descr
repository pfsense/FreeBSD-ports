xed is a small and lightweight text editor, which supports most standard
editing features, plus several not typically found in one's average text
editor (plugins being the most notable of these).

Although new features are always under development, currently xed has:

  * Complete support for UTF-8 text
  * Syntax highlighting for many languages
  * Support for editing remote files
  * Search and replace
  * Printing and print previewing support
  * File revert
  * Complete preferences interface
  * Configurable Python-based plugin system
