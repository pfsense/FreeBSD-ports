Kakoune is a code editor that implements Vi's "keystrokes as a text
editing language" model.  As it's also a modal editor, it is somewhat
similar to the Vim editor (after which Kakoune was originally
inspired).

Kakoune can operate in two modes, normal and insertion.  In insertion
mode, keys are directly inserted into the current buffer.  In normal
mode, keys are used to manipulate the current selection and to enter
insertion mode.

Kakoune has a strong focus on interactivity, most commands provide
immediate and incremental results, while still being competitive (as
in keystroke count) with Vim.

Kakoune works on selections, which are oriented, inclusive range of
characters, selections have an anchor and a cursor character.  Most
commands move both of them, except when extending selection where the
anchor character stays fixed and the cursor one moves around.
