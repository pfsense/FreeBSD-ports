Lingua::ZH::HanDetect uses statistical measures to test a text string to see if
it's in Traditional or Simplified Chinese, as well as which encoding it is in.

If the string does not contain Chinese characters, both the encoding and variant
values will be set to the empty string.

This module is needed because the various encodings for Chinese text tend to
occupy the similar byte ranges, rendering Encode::Guess ineffective.
