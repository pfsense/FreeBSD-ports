NTHU-CS Maple BBS 2.36 BBS-like editor

Besides normal functions, it has some great features for programmers --
goto line (ESC-G)
cut & paste cross files (Ctrl-G to see ve.hlp)
block shift left/right (ESC-J/K, Ctrl-G to see ve.hlp)
parenthesis matching (ESC-[)
seaching (Ctrl-S, ESC-n, ESC-p)
   (matching start of line, case sensitive/in-sensitive, forward/backward)
undo line (ESC - '-', or ESC-_   )
undelete lines (ESC-u)
...
emacs-like hot-key

ve is a tiny editor, about 60K. It's woju's favorite UNIX editor.
The most obvious weakness of ve is changing TABs into Spaces. So
please don't use ve to edit TAB-important files, such as Makefile,
sendmail.cf, syslog.conf... etc.
