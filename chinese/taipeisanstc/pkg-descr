Taipei Sans TC is re-edited based on the KR version of Source Han Sans. Most
Han characters in daily life of the Traditional Chinese world have been applied
unified print style and contemporary Han character characteristics.

Taipei Sans TC retains all Han characters (including Chinese simplified Hanzi,
Japanese Kanji and Korean Hanja) and Japanese Kana from Source Han Sans. Han
characters not originally included in the KR version still retain their
characteristics from the CN (SC), JP or TW (TC) version.
