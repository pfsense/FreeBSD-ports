Source Han Serif: The second Pan-CJK typeface family from Adobe

This is Source Han Serif SC/CN, which supports all four variants in this family
but prioritizes Simplified Chinese Hanzi over other three.

"Source Han Serif supports four different East Asian languages---Simplified
Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean---and the 65,535 glyphs in
each of its seven weights are designed to work together with a consistent design
that emphasizes shared elements between the languages while honoring the
diversity of each. Also included is a rich set of Western glyphs supporting the
Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts, which were derived from Source Serif."
