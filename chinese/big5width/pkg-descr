Unicode define some character width as ambiguous. Software determines
the width of characters accroding the context. However, sometimes it is
hard or impossible to know the context. Thus, this port dirty fixes some
console software, let them recognize all characters in Big5 encoding
range as double width. Now you will be happy with UTF8 terminal and
Big5 fonts :)

This port fixes the zh_TW.UTF-8 locale for wcwidth(3) and wcswidth(3).
