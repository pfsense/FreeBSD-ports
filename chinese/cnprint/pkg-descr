CNPRINT is a utility to print Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK) text
(or convert to PostScript) under DOS, VMS and UNIX systems. It
works just as a print command on your system. Currently GB, Hz,
zW, BIG5, CNS, JIS, EUC, Shift-JIS, KSC, UTF8, UTF7 and UTF16
formats are supported.

CNPRINT also has many other features, among them:

    * print all CJK codes using a single Unicode CJK font
    * print GB using Big5 fonts or print Big5 using GB fonts
    * multiple columns, vertical printing, change font or character
      size within document
    * phrase-based GB<->BIG5 conversions
    * built-in HZ<->GB conversion
    * repair/re-format functions for CJK text
    * envelope and address label printing
    * decode MIME quoted printable (=20=3C=5E like text)
    * true type fonts (TTF) support

With its full Unicode support, it should be able to print other
language (e.g. Thai, Vietnames, Arabic as well). For more information,
please read the help file.
