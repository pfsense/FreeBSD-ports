Mah jongg is an ancient chinese game usually played by four players
with tiles similar to dominos.  This is an X windows version for
the solitaire game originally seen on the PC and later ported to
SunView, and later on completely rewritten by Eddie Kohler.

THEORY OF PLAY
The object of the game is to remove all the tiles from the board.
Tiles are removed in by matching two identical tiles which have
either an open left edge or open right edge.  The only exception
to this rule is that any open "flower" tile (bamboo, orchid, plum,
or chrysanthemum) matches any other open "flower" tile and any open
"season" tile (spring, summer, autumn, or winter) matches any other
open "season" tile.
