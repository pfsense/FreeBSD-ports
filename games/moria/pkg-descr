The game of moria is a single player dungeon simulation.  A player
may choose from a number of races and classes when creating a
character, and then `run' that character over a period of days,
weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by defeating the
Balrog which lurks in the deeper levels.

The player will begin his adventure on the town level where he may
acquire supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by bartering
with various shop owners. After preparing for his adventure, the
player can descend into the dungeons of moria where fantastic
adventures await his coming!
