Moagg stands for "Mother of all gravity games".
In this game you are pilot of a small space ship and have to navigate it
through different caves by using the thrusters and rotating the ship.
But besides gravity there are many other difficulties you have to master.

The game is strongly influenced by some classical cave flyers from
the C64 and Amiga era such as "Space Taxi" or "Gravity Force".
But Moagg is supposed to be more than just a clone of these games.
