  message: <<EOM
At the moment, game assets (graphics, sounds, levels, translations, etc.)
are loaded from the original game files.  Therefore, you will require a
pre-existing Theme Hospital install in order to use CorsixTH.  If you've
got a copy of the original game disk lying around, then great -- copy the
HOSP folder (which should contain directories called Data, QData, Levels,
etc.) from the root of the CD to somewhere on your hard drive, and use
this for the theme_hospital_install setting later.  If you are unable to
acquire the full game data files, then the demo can be downloaded easily
and used instead (though the demo only has one level, and lacks most of
the management screens).
