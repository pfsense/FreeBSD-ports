Blob Wars : Metal Blob Solid is a platform game, not unlike those found on
the Amiga and SNES. The object of the game is to take on the role of
solider Blob, Bob, and play through the various levels and attempt to rescue as
many MIA (Missing In Action) Blobs as possible. This is not quite as straight
forward as it sounds, since the MIAs will often be not directly reachable and
will require some extra thought. Bob also has to contend with environmental
hazards, alien invaders and assimilated Blobs.
