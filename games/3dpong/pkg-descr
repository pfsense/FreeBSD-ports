3D Pong is an X Window game for 1 or 2 players. It's a 3D game based
on the first arcade game, "Pong." Like "Pong," it's a game played with
a ball and paddles. The object is to hit the ball and get it in the
other player's goal. Use your paddle to deflect the ball and keep it
from getting in your goal.
