To finalize installation of Spring, you need to get at least one
map and at least one mod, and place those into your ~/.spring. Also,
if you wish to play mods based on Total Annihilation, you'll need
OTA content as well.

For further instructions, see:

Alternatively, you can use games/springlobby port which allows you
to download maps and setup single- and multiplayer games.
