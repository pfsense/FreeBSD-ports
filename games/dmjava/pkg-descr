Dungeon Master Java is a remake of the classic FTL game Dungeon Master.
It is written entirely in Java, and is designed to run as a stand-alone
application rather than an applet in a web browser. It has high-resolution
graphics that simulate a 3D environment. Most of the graphics are rendered
in the free ray-tracer Pov-Ray. Item graphics and character portraits are
done by hand with a paint program, though many are simply taken from the
original and its sequels and touched-up.

Gameplay is very similar to the original, with real-time action, 90-degree
turns, and step-by-step movement. One major change from the original is that
monsters are not "stuck" in groups: they are completely free to wander,
sometimes occupying a square with other monsters and sometimes not.
