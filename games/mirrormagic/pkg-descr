This is a nice  little  game with color graphics and sound for your
Unix system with color X11. You need an 8-Bit color display or better.
It is not  recommended  on  black&white systems, and maybe not on gray
scale systems.
It  was  first  released  as "Mirror Magic" in the year 1989 on the
Amiga (with ports on other computer systems).
