Way before Lara Croft, back in the 1980's and early 1990's, Rick
Dangerous was the Indiana Jones of computer games, running away from
rolling rocks, avoiding traps, from South America to a futuristic
missile base via Egypt and the Schwarzendumpf castle.

xrick is a clone of Rick Dangerous. Written entirely in C, it relies on
the Simple DirectMedia Layer library.
