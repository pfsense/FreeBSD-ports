RetroArch supports multiple backends for input devices like gamepads:

- evdev/udev: usable with the kernel driver from sysutils/iichid
  or a userspace driver from e.g. multimedia/webcamd
  (you have to grant access permissions on the appropriate
   /dev/input/eventN device to your user account)
- SDL2, which uses userspace raw USB HID access
  (you have to grant access permissions on the appropriate
   /dev/uhidN device to your user account)
