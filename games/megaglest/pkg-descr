MegaGlest is an open source 3D-real-time strategy game, where you control
the armies of one of seven different factions:  Tech, Magic, Egyptians,
Indians, Norsemen, Persian or Romans (Beta). The game is setup in one of
14 naturally looking settings, which -like the unit models- are crafted
with great appreciation for detail. MegaGlest is heavily based on the
widely known Glest, which it forked from in early 2010.
