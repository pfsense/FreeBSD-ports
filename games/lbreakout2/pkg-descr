The polished successor to LBreakout offers you a new challenge in more
than 50 levels with loads of new bonuses (goldshower, joker, explosive
balls, bonus magnet ...), maluses (chaos, darkness, weak balls, malus
magnet ...) and special bricks (growing bricks, explosive bricks,
regenerative bricks, indestructible bricks, chaotic bricks).

And if you're through with all the levels you can create complete new
levelsets with the integrated easy-to-use level editor!
