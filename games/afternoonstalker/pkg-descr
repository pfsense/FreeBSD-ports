Afternoonstalker is a clone of the Intellivision game Night Stalker.
You are in a two-dimensional maze in which you are attacked by robots
that shoot at you and that you must shoot down. You must pick up a gun
somewhere in the maze in order to have a few bullets to shoot. Avoid
the spiders and the bats, which can paralyze you long enough for a
robot to come and shoot you. The bunker in the center is your only
protection.
