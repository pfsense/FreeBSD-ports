Port of pMARS using the Simple Directmedia Library. Currently the port
is in beta testing stage testing and bug reports/feature requests are
more than welcome.

Features/fixes:

* Environment sensitive. Now looks for macro files in the directory
  specified by the environment variable PMARSHOME if they are not
  found in the current directory.
* Both Win32 and X11 supported.
* Command line history using Shift-Up and Shift-Down keys.
* Rewrote text display and screen update routines for faster text
  panels (for slow computers like mine.)
* BIG core cells for those tiny cores. (Choose a display mode larger
  than 2, e.g. -v 134.)
