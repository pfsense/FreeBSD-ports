What if a simple mental exercise could improve your memory and
intelligence?

A recent study published in PNAS, an important scientific journal,
shows that a particular memory task called Dual N-Back actually
improves working memory (short term memory) and fluid intelligence.
This finding is important because fluid intelligence was previously
thought to be unchangeable. The game involves remembering a sequence
of spoken letters and a sequence of positions of a square at the
same time.

In addition to its ability to closely replicate the conditions of
the original study by Jaeggi et al. (2008), Brain Workshop includes
optional extended game modes such as Triple N-Back and Arithmetic
N-Back. It also includes features such as statistics tracking,
graphs and easy configurability.
