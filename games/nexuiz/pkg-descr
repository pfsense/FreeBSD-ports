Nexuiz is a fast-paced, chaotic, and intense multiplayer first person
shooter, focused on providing basic, old style deathmatch.

Nexuiz is built on the power of the Darkplaces engine, which is a heavily
modified version of the original Quake.  Darkplaces features realtime
lighting and stencil shadows, bumpmapping, gloss, bloom, and totally
rewritten network code that supports up to 64 players on a single server.
While quality gameplay was our primary goal, its graphics technology and
artwork allows the game to compete with the current quality of commercial
games.

Any online deathmatch fan will instantly feel at home with Nexuiz' weapons
and movement style.  The fast server browser and quick loading time allows
you to jump right into a game at a moments notice and play a quick game.

Now it also comes with community map pack compiled by Strahlemann.  It
includes 35 maps, and a campaign mode for the user to fight through.  The
map pack includes Quake3 community maps, Nexuiz community maps, and some
new maps from Nexuiz developers.
