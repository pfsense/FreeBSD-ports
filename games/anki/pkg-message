  message: <<EOD
  The 2.1.58 release fixes an issue in 2.1.57 that caused cards and deck
  presets to be reset to the default ease, if you exported a .colpkg with
  compatibility with older clients enabled, or used the downgrade and quit
  option, then opened the collection again.

  For the former issue, this occurred to the collection you were exporting
  from, and not just the .colpkg file. If you were affected by this, running
  the following in the debug console after updating should restore your cards
  to the ease they were at when you last reviewed them, if they were not
  reviewed after the problem occurred. Please make a backup before proceeding.

  updated = 0
  for cid, old, new in mw.col.db.all("select id, factor, (select factor from revlog where cid=cards.id order by id desc limit 1) as factor2 from cards where type=2"):
    if new and old != new:
      card = mw.col.get_card(cid)
      card.factor = new
      mw.col.update_card(card)
      updated += 1
  print("updated", updated)

  It will print the number of updated cards.  Instructions how to use the debug
  console can be found here:
