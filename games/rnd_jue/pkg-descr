"R'n'D jue" is an alternative version of Rocks'n'Diamonds, developed in
cooperation with R&D author Holger Schemel.

In contrast to the "rnd_jue -contribution package"
(still available on Download page) it is a separate and independent program
with the same source code as the original R'n'D but with a
completely different appearance.

This is based on the wide customizing features which have been developed
recently while all the integrated games have been produced with the R'n'D
Level Editor, which is actually a great "game creation tool" for
non-programmers. So far "R'n'D jue" is also an example for what is possible
with the old Rocks'n'Diamonds and should be an inspiration for potential
level designers and game developers.

Regarding the games and levels "R'n'D jue" is intended for players who have both
an eye for an attractive design and a bent especially for "puzzle games".
The user will also find "action" and many opportunities to test his
manual-skill - nevertheless, the main feature of "R'n'D jue" is primarily
to offer some (moderate) challenges for the brain.
