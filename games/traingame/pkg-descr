Train Game is a game about trains! Woo! You control a train which you drive
around a 3D world picking up cargo, trundle it about, and deliver it for PROFIT;
whilst avoiding disasters like falling off the rails, hitting other trains,
bad weather, or privatisation.
Imagine Elite but with trains instead of space craft.
Cant believe no ones thought of it before.
