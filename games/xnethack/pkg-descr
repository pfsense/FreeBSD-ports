xNetHack is a fork of the dungeon exploration game NetHack.  It is a
distant descendent of Rogue and Hack, and a direct descendant of the
development version of NetHack 3.7.

The main goals of xNetHack are to take vanilla NetHack and:

 - Fix gameplay balance issues.
 - Remove tedious and frustrating parts of the game.
 - Make uninteresting parts of the game more interesting.
 - Experiment with new ideas from the community.

In general, the game design takes a conservative approach to changing
the gameplay compared to other variants, with focus on deepening
elements of the game rather than broadening them.  For example, this
philosophy would prefer to differentiate monsters in a class that all
tend to play the same way, instead of adding new monsters to that class.
