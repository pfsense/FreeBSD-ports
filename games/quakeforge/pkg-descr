This is a port of the GPL'd Quake 1 source maintained by the Quake Forge
team. They're patching it with an eye towards portability and bug fixes,
and in the future, feature enhancments.

Note that to actually USE this port you will need to obtain an installed
copy of Quake 1 from a DOS/Windows machine.
