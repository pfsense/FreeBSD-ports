When Simutrans could only support 64px size graphics, pak128 already
started. First pak to feature a complex economy and have a very
wide variety of objects. It contains roughly 7 times more graphic
data than pak64 and thus requires by far the largest amount of RAM
and processing power of all Simutrans sets.
