Crimson Fields is a tactical war game in the tradition of Battle Isle. While
not being an exact clone, it tries to keep closer to the very first part of
the series than to the later ones, especially with regard to a rather simple
rule set and straight forward game play. Right now, the game can only be
played by two human adversaries in hot-seat mode or via e-mail. There is no
AI player code yet.
