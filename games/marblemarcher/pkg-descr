This is the community edition of Marble Marcher, a procedurally rendered fractal
physics marble game in which you must get to the flag in each level as fast as
you can. With 24 levels to unlock and an active speedrunning community, along
with a fully-featured level editor, there's always new features being developed.
If you complete all levels, you can use cheats to create and enhance a more
exploratory experience.
