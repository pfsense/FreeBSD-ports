Alien Arena (native version) has been installed.

1) The OSS (native FreeBSD sound) version of Alien Arena 2011 (named
"alienarena") uses by default a slow sound speed, which causes a notable
delay. To solve this you have to run it once like this:

$ alienarena +set sndspeed <speed>

Where <speed> could be 22050 and 44100 for example (the default that has the
delay is 11025, and the SDL version uses 22050). The value of "sndspeed" will
be saved in the configuration file for future runs.

2) Enjoy it :)
