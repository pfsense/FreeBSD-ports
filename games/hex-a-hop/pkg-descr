Hex-a-hop is a puzzle game based on hexagonal tiles. There is no time
limit and no real-time elements.

The objective is simply to destroy all the green hexagonal tiles on each
of the 100 levels. As you progress through the game, more types of tiles
are introduced which make things more difficult and interesting
(hopefully).
