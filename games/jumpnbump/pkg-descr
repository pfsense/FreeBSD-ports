This is a game for the whole family. You play cute fluffy little
bunnies and hop on each other's heads.

At the beginning you are in the menu, where you have to let each
active player jump over the tree trunk to enter the play area, and
then walk to the right. You will then enter the arena. The aim is
to jump on the other bunnies' heads...

Jump 'n Bump was originally a DOS game by Brainchild Design, which
was open sourced under the GPL license and ported to SDL, and then
SDL2.
