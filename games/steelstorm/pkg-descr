Steel Storm is an old school top down arcade shooter with score
oriented competitive gameplay, and is designed for people who like
fast paced action and have limited amounts of time to play computer
games.

The events take place in an alternative universe where you control
an advanced hovertank, packed with the most advanced and sophisticated
weapons. Your task is simple, but, nevertheless, is not trivial.
In the fight with presumed extraterrestrial invaders, you must
prevail!
