This package is set to allow per-user config files, and a shared books
directory.  To accomplish this, crafty is setgid nobody, and the books
and learning information are owned by the user 'nobody.'

The location values are tunable, see message when make is issued.

If you have an SMP system, add a line to your ~/.craftyrc file to the
effect:

smpmt=2 (or however many cpus you have)

Do not set this higher than you really have, or performance will
actually drop.

New "skill" command that can be used to "dumb down" crafty.  "skill <n>"
where n is a number between 1 and 100.  100 is max (default) skill.
Skill 70 will drop the playing Elo by about 200 points.  Skill 50 will
drop it about 400 points.  The curve is not linear, and the closer you
get to 1, the lower the rating.
