The object of the game is to remove all of the blocks from the screen
before the time runs out. Two blocks are removed at a time,
and must be of the same color. After completing a level,
you will be rewarded with a bonus point for every tick left on the clock.
For each level thereafter, the time to complete the the level will be shorter.
