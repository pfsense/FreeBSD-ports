The `exhaust' project is a redcode simulator that is (hopefully)
easy to embed into your applications, as an alternative to pMARS.

The documentation contains the following:

README     -  Instructions to embed exhaust in a program.
test.pl    -  Perl script to check for differences between exhaust
              and pMARS.
src/       -  The C source code of exhaust (highly commented).
warriors/  -  Test warriors.

The "warriors" subdirectory contains Redcode assembly files (.red)
and parsed Redcode assembly files (.rc). The last ones can be loaded
into exhaust, the others have to be parsed, for example with pMARS.

NOTE: this documentation is only useful for developers.
