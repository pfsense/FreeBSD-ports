fmars is Fast Memory Array Redcode Simulator

A specialized simulator for the game of Corewars. It's designed to be
of particular use in automated redcode optimizers and evolvers. fmars
borrows the idea from Martin Ankerl's qmars and pushes it to the
extreme.

It generates source code with special case for every possible
opcode/addressing mode combination. This allows some optimizations
that aren't possible in other simulators.

fmars is compatible with pMARS with an exception for p-space, which
is not yet implemented.
