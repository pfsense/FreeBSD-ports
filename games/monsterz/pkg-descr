Monsterz is a little arcade puzzle game, similar to the famous Bejeweled or
Zookeeper.

The goal of the game is to create rows of similar monsters, either
horizontally or vertically. The only allowed move is the swap of two adjacent
monsters, on the condition that it creates a row of three or more. When
alignments are cleared, pieces fall from the top of the screen to fill the
board again. Chain reactions earn you even more points.

This game is mostly about luck, but it remains highly addictive. You have been
warned. Currently two modes are available:

    * Classic - play against the clock and clear a given number of each monster
      type to reach next level.
    * Puzzle - clear lines of monsters to move pieces around and put together
      the puzzle.
    * Training - play against the clock in a neverending level, chose the timer
      difficulty and number of monsters for infinite fun.
