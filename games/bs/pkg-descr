Battleships solitaire game with a color point-and-shoot interface
in the style of blue and galaxis games (for console).

This program allows you to play the familiar Battleships game against
the computer on a 10x10 board. The interface is visual and largely
self-explanatory; you place your ships and pick your shots by moving
the cursor around the `sea' with the rogue/hack motion keys hjklyubn.
