Warzone 2100 is a real-time strategy game, developed by Pumpkin Studios and
published by Eidos-Interactive. Although comparable to Earth2150 in many
significant respects, it does contain aspects that are unique. These include
various radar technologies, a greater focus on artillery and counter-battery
technologies, more frequent in-game cinematic updates as gameplay progress, as
well as a different vehicle design method. It was released in 1999 for both PC
and Playstation.

In late 2004 warzone was released by its copyright holders, Eidos-Interactive,
to the public under the GNU General Public License (GPL), and the Warzone 2100
Resurrection Project was born.
