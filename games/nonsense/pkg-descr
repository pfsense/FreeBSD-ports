From the nonsense README:

Nonsense generates random (and sometimes humorous) text from datafiles and
templates using a very simple, recursive grammar. It's like having a million
monkeys sitting in front of a million typewriters, without having to feed or
clean up after them.  From fake Slashdot headlines to absurd college courses to
buzzword bingo cards, Nonsense is a good way to waste time.
