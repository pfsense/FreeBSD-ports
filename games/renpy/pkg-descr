Ren'Py is a visual novel engine – used by thousands of creators from
around the world – that helps you use words, images, and sounds to
tell interactive stories that run on computers and mobile
devices. These can be both visual novels and life simulation
games. The easy to learn script language allows anyone to efficiently
write large visual novels, while its Python scripting is enough for
complex simulation games.
