R1Q2 is an enhanced client/server for Quake II. Based on the id Software 3.21
source, rather than concentrate on fancy graphics, embedded MP3 players and
other "gimmick" features, R1Q2 is focused on providing stability, security and
speed whilst remaining fully compatible with existing mods and other clients.
