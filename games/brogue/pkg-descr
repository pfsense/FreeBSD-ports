Countless adventurers before you have descended this torch-lit
staircase, seeking the promised riches below. As you reach the bottom
and step into the wide cavern, the doors behind you seal with a powerful
magic...

    Welcome to the Dungeons of Doom!

Brogue is a single-player strategy game set in the halls of a mysterious
and randomly-generated dungeon. The objective is simple enough --
retrieve the fabled Amulet of Yendor from the 26th level -- but the
dungeon is riddled with danger. Horrifying creatures and devious,
trap-ridden terrain await. Yet it is also riddled with weapons, potions,
and artifacts of forgotten power. Survival demands strength and cunning
in equal measure as you descend, making the most of what the dungeon
gives you. You will make sacrifices, narrow escapes, and maybe even some
friends along the way -- but will you be one of the lucky few to return
alive?
