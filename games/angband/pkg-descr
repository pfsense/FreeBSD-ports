A roguelike game derived from Moria, based loosely on the books of J.R.R.
Tolkien.  The ultimate aim of the game is to advance in skill and strength,
collecting better and more powerful magical items until you are ready to face
the Master of the dungeon: Morgoth himself!  Your character, the dungeon, and
all the monsters are represented on the screen using ASCII characters.  Game
also provides graphical tiles mode.
