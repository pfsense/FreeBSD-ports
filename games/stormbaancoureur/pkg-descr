Stormbaan Coureur is the Linux game that was formerly known as
Sturmbahnfahrer. It is back with a larger track, more challenges,
many improvements in a PC (Politically Correct) edition. In this
game, it is all about the car Physics. If you want to master it,
try to have the laws of physics work with you, not against you.

Stormbaan Coureur is a game by Bram Stolk.
