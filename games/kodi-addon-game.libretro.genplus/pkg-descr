Genesis Plus GX is an open-source Sega 8/16 bit emulator focused on
accuracy and portability. Initially ported and developped on
Gamecube / Wii consoles through libogc / devkitPPC, this emulator is now
available on many other platforms through various frontends such as:
- Retroarch (libretro)
- Bizhawk
- OpenEmu

The source code, initially based on Genesis Plus 1.2a by Charles
MacDonald has been heavily modified & enhanced, with respect to original
goals and design, in order to improve emulation accuracy as well as
adding support for new peripherals, cartridge or console hardware and
many other exciting features.

The result is that Genesis Plus GX is now more a continuation of the
original project than a simple port, providing very accurate emulation
and 100% compatibility with Genesis / Mega Drive, Sega/Mega CD, Master
System, Game Gear & SG-1000 released software (including all unlicensed
or pirate known dumps), also emulating backwards compatibility modes
when available. All the people who contributed (directly or indirectly)
to this project are listed on the Credits page.
