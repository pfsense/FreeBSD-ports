LinCity is an SVGALIB and X based city/country simulation game for Linux.
(Solaris 2.5, FreeBSD, HP_UX, AIX and IRIX are ALPHA at this time, but have
been reported to work - sometimes needing a tweak to the Makefile[s].)

You are required to build and maintain a city. You must feed, house,
provide jobs and goods for your residents. You can build a sustainable
economy with the help of renewable energy and recycling, or you can go for
broke and build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and resource
starved planet, it's up to you. Due to the finite resources available in any
one place, this is not a game that you can leave for long periods of time.
