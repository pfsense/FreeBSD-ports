Tenebrae is a modification of the Quake source that adds stencil shadows and
per pixel lights to Quake.  Stencil shadows allow for realistic shadow
effects on every object in the game world.  Per pixel lighting allows you to
have fine surface details correctly lit.  These are essentially the same
algorithms as used by the new Doom game.
