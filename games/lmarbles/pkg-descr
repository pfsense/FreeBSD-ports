The goal is to arrange a figure out of single marbles within a time
limit to reach the next level.

Your goal in the puzzle game marbles is to create a more or less complex
figure out of single marbles within a time limit to reach the next
level. Sounds easy? Well, there is a problem: If a marble starts to
move, it will not stop until it hits a wall or another marble.
