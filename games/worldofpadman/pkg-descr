World of Padman (WoP) is an open source first-person shooter computer game
available in both English and German.  Originally it was a modification for
the Quake III Arena titled PadMod, created in the year 2004.

After the source code for the Quake III Arena was released, the game became
standalone.  The idea is based on the Padman comic strip for the magazine
PlayStation Games, created by the professional cartoon artist Andreas "ENTE"
Endres, who is also the man who made many of the maps included with the game
in 1998.

The current version runs on an enhanced version of the ioquake3 engine, which
is based on the Quake III Arena engine.  Most of the maps in the game are
lilliput style, and have a commercial-quality level of graphic complexity.

Because it was originally a mod for Quake III Arena, most of the gameplay is
similar.  However, there is no Capture the Flag mode in World of Padman.
World of Padman fully supports bots with a variety of skill levels in both
online and offline play for all of the game types included.  A single-player
mode has not yet been implemented.  Players can also record audio and video
as they play.  The game fully supports modifications, and custom maps can be
created.
