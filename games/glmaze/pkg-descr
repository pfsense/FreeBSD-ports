glMaze is a multiplayer maze game based on the opengl 3d graphics engine.
If a command line argument is present, glmaze tries to interpret this as
the server name to connect to. If no argument was given, glmaze becomes
the master client and starts a local server. Up to six players can join
a session. Only the master client can start the session. Other players
can join a running game. The game stops when the first player reaches
ten kills. The player with the top score at this moment is the winner.
