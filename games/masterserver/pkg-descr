LASANGE aims at creating a mostly-automated LAN session administration and
management system. It will provide game server management (instant deployment
of game servers) and tournament management in a more advanced and automated
way than other systems. It will also consist of basic tools for LAN sessions
such as a generic modular Masterserver, IRC bot, etc.
