Free Bee is an enhanced Free Software clone of The New York Times
game Spelling Bee.

In this game, your goal is to find as many words as you can with
the seven letters you are given. You don't have to use any letter
except the middle letter and letters can be used more than once in
a word. Finding a word that uses all seven letters yields bonus
points! Every game has at least one such word, and many games have
multiple.

Earning enough points to reach the rank of Queen Bee wins the game!

You can play the daily challenge like the original game or try your
hand at a nearly infinite number of computer-generated random
challenges. Unlike the original game, you are not restricted to
only a single game per day!
