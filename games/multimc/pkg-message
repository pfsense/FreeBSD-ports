Minecraft requires LWJGL (the Lightweight Java Game Library) to run.
Mojang hosts prebuilt LWJGL shared objects for Windows, macOS, and Linux,
which MultiMC is written to download and add to a new instance. The FreeBSD
port of MultiMC is patched to use the system LWJGL instead, to work around the
lack of a Mojang-provided binary for FreeBSD.

From version 1.13, Minecraft requires LWJGL 3 to run, but presently the latest
version in the Ports Collection is 2.9.3. In order to run Minecraft 1.13
instances in MultiMC, LWJGL 3 will have to be ported, and ideally MultiMC should
be patched to use version 2 or 3 depending on the Minecraft version of a given instance.
This is planned for the future, but as of now it is only possible to play versions
up to 1.12.x with this port.
