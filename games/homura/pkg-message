Homura was created for the gui usage in the first place, the gui can be opened via the commandline by typing Homura but also via a shortcut (if you have Homura allowed to create one).

For terminal fans there are also some fast commands:

Examples:

    To install something use: Homura Install Steam
    To launch something use: Homura Launch Steam
    To uninstall something use: Homura Uninstall Steam

To see what applications are currently working take a look at:

Enjoy playing!
