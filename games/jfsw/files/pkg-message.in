JonoF's Shadow Warrior is now installed.

Before playing, you need to copy the following files from the original (or
shareware) game:

 * sw.grp
 * sw.rts

to %%DATADIR%%

If you want music support as well (optional), also copy CD track files to that
directory. They must be Ogg Vorbis files and named:

  * track{02..14}.ogg

Launch the game by typing 'jfsw'

Enjoy!
