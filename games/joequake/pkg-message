To start it in full-screen mode you can run it with the "-fullscreen"
parameter.

If you have mouse problems you can try running it with the "-nomdga"
parameter (this will make the mouse work fine when the DGA X11 extension is
disabled).

If you have sound problems try running it with the parameter
"-sndspeed <speed>", where "<speed>" could be 22050 or 44100 for example.

If you enable water alpha ("r_wateralpha" or from the menu), set "r_novis" to
"1" or you will have problems with water/lava. Note that the value of
"r_novis" will be saved in the configuration file.
