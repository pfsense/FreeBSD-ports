This is a port of Atomic Tanks, a 2D tank game where small tanks use
cartoonishly large weapons to blow up each other. Atomic Tanks is loosely
based on the classic DOS game, Scorched Earth. The game is very
flexible, allowing anywhere from two to ten players, variable environments
and a wide range of weapons and other items.

To work, this game requires that the Allegro graphics library be installed.
