This is a port of Apogee's 3D action title Rise of the Triad, originally
released in 1994.  This port duplicates the functionality of the original
game on modern operating systems, including Linux, Win32, OSX and now FreeBSD.

In order to run game you'll need either the original game data or a shareware
version (see pkg-message).
