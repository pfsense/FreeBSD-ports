Openage: a volunteer project to create a free engine clone of the Genie Engine
used by Age of Empires, Age of Empires II (HD) and Star Wars: Galactic
Battlegrounds, comparable to projects like OpenMW, OpenRA, OpenTTD and
OpenRCT2. Openage uses the original game assets (such as sounds and graphics),
but (for obvious reasons) doesn't ship them. To play, you require an original
AoE II : TC installation or AoE II: HD (installation via Wine).
