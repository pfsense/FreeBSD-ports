Welcome to the Arena, where high-ranking warriors are transformed into
spineless mush. Abandoning every ounce of common sense and any trace of doubt,
you lunge onto a stage of harrowing landscapes and veiled abysses. Your new
environment rejects you with lava pits and atmospheric hazards as legions of
foes surround you, testing the gut reaction that brought you here in the first
place. Your new mantra: Fight or be finished.
