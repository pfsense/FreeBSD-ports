Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course
of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They
then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and
kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs
may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking
and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the "Rope"
or "Parachute", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn
is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with
excessive thinking or moving.

A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players
during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Shotgun,
Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope,
Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause explosions
that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks. The landscape
is an island floating on a body of water, or a restricted cave with
water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when it enters the water (either
by falling off the island, or through a hole in the bottom of it),
it is thrown off either side of the arena or when its health is
reduced, typically from contact with explosions, to zero (the damage
dealt to the attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU
turn is shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).
