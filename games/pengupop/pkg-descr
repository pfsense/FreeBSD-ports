The aim of this game is to shoot colored balls so the form similarily
colored groups, causing them to fall out of the screen. You can
either win by clearing your entire field, or lose if any balls
attach below the white line near the bottom.

The main difference between this game and the classic Bust a Move,
is online multiplayer support, with menu options for playing against
random opponents, or starting or joining a named (private) game.
