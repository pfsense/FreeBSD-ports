Augustus is a fork of the Julius project that intends to incorporate gameplay
changes.

The aim of this project is to provide enhanced, customizable gameplay to
Caesar 3 using project Julius UI enhancements.

Augustus is able to load Caesar 3 and Julius saves, however saves made with
Augustus will not work outside Augustus.

Gameplay enhancements include:
*  Roadblocks
*  Market special orders
*  Global labour pool
*  Partial warehouse storage
*  Increased game limits
*  Zoom controls
*  And more!
