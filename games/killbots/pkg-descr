Killbots is a simple game of evading killer robots.  Who created
the robots and why they have been programmed to destroy, no one
knows.  All that is known is that the robots are numerous and their
sole objective is to destroy you.  Fortunately for you, their creator
has focused on quantity rather than quality and as a result the
robots are severely lacking in intelligence.  Your superior wit and
a fancy teleportation device are your only weapons against the
never- ending stream of mindless automatons.
