Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic world.
While some have described it as a "zombie game", there's far more to
Cataclysm than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistant,
procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization
for for food, equipment, or, if you're lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of
gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide
variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer
robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like
yourself, that want what you have...
