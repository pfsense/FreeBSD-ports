Free Tennis is a tennis simulation. The most notable features of Free Tennis
are:

- Real tactics are useful in the game. For example, it is best to take the net
  with a slow, low shot (backspin); it is best to play diagonal when you are
  decentered horizontally, in order not to give angles; you should get back to
  center and behind the baseline after the shot, in order not to be caught in
  No-Man's-Land when the opponent hits
- The A.I. is very advanced and reflects those tactics;
- You have total control over the parabola described by the shot;
- The graphic gestures are realistic and elegant;
- Different players have different skills;
