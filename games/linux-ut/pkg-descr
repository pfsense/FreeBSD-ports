Unreal Tournament, the ultimate challenge of competitive game-play.
Unreal Tournament showcases the enhanced, hugely-popular Unreal engine,
the benchmark of 3-D graphical excellence and immersive gameplay.
This stand-alone game brings you never before,
richly-textured and thrilling environments.
In single player mode with "bots" (virtual customizeable team mates) or
in multiplayer mode with up to 16 bots and/or humans.
Step into the Unreal arena and stake your life in the pursuit of victory
as the Unreal Grand Master. Or suffer the agonizing death of defeat.
