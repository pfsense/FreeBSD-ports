This is a game similar to Thrust - you pick things up with your
ship, carry them off, and drop them somewhere. Exactly why this
needs to be done is not well explained.

Features realistic(ish) physics: Explosions toss things around,
some weapons knock enemies back, and of course gravity is a constant
companion. Improved weapons are available to replace the pathetic
peashooter that the player starts out with.
