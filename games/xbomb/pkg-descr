A program that looks superficially like the minesweeper program that
comes supplied with MS Windows (and is also available in other
versions). Runs under X Windows on the UNIX operating system.

Features
--------
There are a number of features that make this version different from
the others available (that I have seen).

3 Grid Tile options
        Hexagonal      - Easy (the endgame can be difficult).
        Square         - Traditional.
        Triangular     - Difficult.

3 Grid sizes
        Small          - 8x8 with 10 bombs
        Medium         - 16x16 with 40 bombs
        Large          - 30x16 with 99 bombs

Highscore table
        10 entries for the fastest times for each of the 3 levels of
        each of the 3 grid shapes.
