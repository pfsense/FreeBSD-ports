Frogatto is a "platformer", or "jump-and-run" videogame.  Like many classic
games, the world is viewed as a cross-section seen from the side, and your
character walks and jumps between solid platforms, whilst avoiding monsters.

Frogatto is not a clone of any specific game; although, being a platformer,
it is impossible not to have something in common with titles like Mario or
Sonic, but authors are trying to innovate a bit.

Frogatto is also the protagonist's name.  It's eponymous.
