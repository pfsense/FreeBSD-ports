QCC is the original QuakeC compiler created by John Carmack of id Software,
used to generate `progs.dat' file that essentially holds game logic behind
the graphic engine.  It is used primarily to create modifications for Quake
and QuakeWorld.

Note that more feature-rich, optimizing QuakeC compilers are available in
the Ports Collection.
