NetRadiant is a fork of the well-known map editor for Quake 3 based games,
GtkRadiant 1.5.  The focus is put on stabilizing and bugfixing the included
map compiler, q3map2, so it can become a reliable tool for map authors.

Fixes include:

  - Better decompiling by q3map2 (texcoords no longer get lost)
  - Fixed 3D display in the Windows XP software renderer
  - Fixed deluxemapping when a surface is lit from both sides
  - Fixed some buffer overruns
  - Fixed the "expand selection to whole entities" feature
  - Fixed the origin of mirrored eclassmodel entities
  - Key bindings no longer disappear when using an international
    keyboard layout
  - Plane snapping fixed (no more fall-through holes in imported
    model terrain)
  - Various other map compiler fixes

Original, classic GtkRadiant 1.5 is available as `games/gtkradiant' port.
