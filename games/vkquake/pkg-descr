vkQuake is a Quake 1 port using Vulkan instead of OpenGL for rendering. It is
based on the popular QuakeSpasm port and runs all mods compatible with it like
Arcane Dimensions or In The Shadows.

Compared to QuakeSpasm vkQuake also features a software Quake like underwater
effect, has better color precision, generates mipmap for water surfaces at
runtime and has native support for anti-aliasing and AF.
