TADS is a set of programming tools specially designed for writing
adventure games. TADS consists of:
    * A programming language, which resembles C and Java.
    * A compiler, which reads a set of source files written in the
TADS programming language and produces a portable binary game
file.
    * A library, which provides a set of generic adventure game
definitions.
    * An interactive debugger, which lets you examine
your program's execution in order to find and fix programming
errors.
    * An interpreter, which a player uses to run your game.
