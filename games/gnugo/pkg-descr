This plays a competent beginner's game of Go (the development line has
achieved a rating of 17 kyu on the No Name Go Server, nngs.cosmic.org 9696),
and operates both in plain ASCII and using the Go Modem Protocol.

For a nice graphical interface, cgoban's Go Modem feature can operate as a
front-end for gnugo (cgoban is available as a port/package).
