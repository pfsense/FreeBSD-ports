Tanglet is a single player word finding game based on Boggle. The
object of the game is to list as many words as you can before the
time runs out. There are several timer modes that determine how
much time you start with, and if you get extra time when you find
a word.

You can join letters horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in any
direction to make a word, so as long as the letters are next to
each other on the board. However, you cannot reuse the same letter
cells in a single word. Also, each word must be at least three
letters on a normal board, and four letters on a large board.
