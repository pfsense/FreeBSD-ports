glBSP is a node builder specially designed to be used with OpenGL-based
DOOM game engines.  It adheres to the "GL-Friendly Nodes" specification,
which means it adds some new special nodes to a WAD file that makes it
very easy for an OpenGL DOOM engine to compute the polygons needed for
drawing the levels.

There are many DOOM ports that understand the GL Nodes created by glBSP,
including: EDGE, Doomsday (JDOOM), PrBoom, Vavoom, ZDoomGL, Legacy 2.0,
and Doom3D.
