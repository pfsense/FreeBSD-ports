still a work in progress, it has a pretty solid set of features:

 * Nearly complete core (CPU, video, audio, ...)
 * JIT recompiler for fast emulation
 * OpenGL renderer, 3D upscaling
 * RTC, microphone, lid close/open
 * Joystick support
 * Savestates
 * Various display position/sizing/rotation modes
 * (WIP) Wifi: local multiplayer, online connectivity
 * (WIP) DSi emulation
 * DLDI
 * (WIP) GBA slot add-ons
 * and more are planned!
