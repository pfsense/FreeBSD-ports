Evilfinder shows you whether things are evil.  By default, the port will
install a wrapper called "evilfinder," but you can define WITH_WRAPPER
to build the web-oriented default binary only.

   **** THE PROOF THAT The FreeBSD Project IS EVIL ****

Thus, "The FreeBSD Project" is 33362.  Add 1947, the year Aleister Crowley paid
a longer visit to Hell.  The result is 35309.  Turn the number backwards, and
add 1945 - the year Mussolini was executed for the first time. The number is now
92298.  Add 9981 to it - this is the year "Scrabble" was invented to promote
violence and anger, written backwards - you will get 102279.  Subtract 23, the
symbol of death. The result will be 102256.  Divide the number by 83 - this is
the symbol of slavery, backwards. It gives 1232.  This number, read as octal,
gives 666 - the number of the Beast.  This is truly evil. QED.
