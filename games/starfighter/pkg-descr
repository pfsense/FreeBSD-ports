Project: Starfighter is an old school 2D shoot 'em up. In the game you take on
the role of a rebel pilot called Chris, who is attempting to overthrow a
military corporation called Weapco. Weapco has seized control of the known
universe and currently rules it with an iron fist. Chris can no longer stand
back and watch as millions of people suffer and die. He steals an experimental
craft known as "Firefly" and begins his mission to fight his way to Sol,
freeing key systems along the way. The game opens with Chris attempting to
escape a Weapco patrol that has intercepted him.
