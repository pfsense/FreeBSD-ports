Species is a corewars evolver. It is a program to generates corewars warriors
using genetic algorithms. This is the program which generated the best evolved
warrior in the recent Multi-Manics corewars competition. Contemporaries
include YACE, RedRace, Red Maker and CCAI.

Species is definitely the most over-engineered, complicated and buggy Corewars
Evolver on the freeware market today!
