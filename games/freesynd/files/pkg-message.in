    Freesynd has been installed.

    To actually play the game you need to copy the original game
    datafiles to %%DATADIR%%/data/ directory.

    Game will expect english version of the game data files, if you
    have a different language, you can try setting the test_data
    configuration option to false and see if the game runs with
    that data.
