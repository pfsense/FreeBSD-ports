Kubrick is a game based on the Rubik's Cube (TM) puzzle.  The cube
sizes range from 2x2x2 up to 6x6x6, or you can play with irregular
"bricks" such as 5x3x2 or "mats" such as 6x4x1 or 2x2x1.  The game
has a selection of puzzles at several levels of difficulty, as well
as demos of pretty patterns and solution moves, or you can make up
your own puzzles.
