EDuke32 is a fork of the JFDuke3D port of Duke Nukem 3D (aka Duke3D), merging
it with EDuke to provide many new features for mod authors. Built on the
foundation of Jonathon "JonoF" Fowler's JFDuke3D work (including Build engine
author Ken "Awesoken" Silverman's badass Polymost renderer) combined with
Matt "Matteus" Saettler's EDuke advances, EDuke32 screams cool so loud you'll
think Bruce Dickinson got uppercut in the balls by Freddy Krueger. Hell, it
even comes with Mapster32, the enhanced Build editor.

The EDuke32 and Mapster32 development team is lead by Richard "TerminX"
Gobeille, author of the popular Cinema mod for Max Payne 2, the Project X TC
demo for EDuke 2.0, and Mapster, the original Build editor enhancement.
