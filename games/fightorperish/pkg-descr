Fight or Perish (FOP) is a dungeon-crawling game based on Jack Pavelich's
Atari 8-bit computer game "Dandy", which was in turn the influence for
Atari Games arcade game "Gauntlet".

Wikipedia "Gauntlet (1985 video game)"

FOP uses concepts from both games, providing one- to four-player action in
dungeons filled with creeping enemies.

Collect and use bombs to wipe out screenfuls of enemies, keys to unlock doors,
and gather food and treasure along the way to stay alive.

Choose from four characters, each with different abilities and weaknesses.
(The one with the strongest weapon also has the weakest health,
the fastest one cannot shoot diagonally, etc.)
