You must keep the tiles from piling up to the top of the board or
they will crash down on you. But be warned they keep coming and
they come faster each time. Click on groups of three or more to
remove tiles. Additional "helper" tiles are given occasionally to
assist and some times hinder in the removal of tiles.
