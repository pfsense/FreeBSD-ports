MVDSV is popular QuakeWorld server with new amazing possibilities, most
notably, of course, being multi-view demos.  MVD demos are probably the
biggest step in QuakeWorld since Qizmo release.  MVDSV is also the best
server to use with KTeams Pro deathmatch mod, and in fact is required
for the latter's full functionality.
