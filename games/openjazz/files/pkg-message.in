OpenJazz is now installed. In order to work, the game
needs additional files. Please buy the full version or
download the shareware version (e.g.) here :

https://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/jazz-jackrabbit

and copy every file of the game *uppercase* to
%%DATADIR%%

Once this is done, run 'openjazz'. Enjoy !
