Phalanx is a chess playing program. Phalanx is xboard compatible.
Running with xboard: 'xboard -fcp phalanx'. Note that permanent
brain (pondering) is off by default. Newer versions of xboard set
it on with the 'hard' command. If this does not work, try 'xboard
-fcp "phalanx -p+"' or (for <4.0.0 versions of xboard) change your
initString (see Xboard documentation for details). It's better to
stop permanent brain in both programs, when playing Phalanx against
another program on a machine with one CPU.

It's also possible to run phalanx without xboard. Do "phalanx -h"
to get a list of command line options. One important command of
phalanx's ASCII interface is "help".
