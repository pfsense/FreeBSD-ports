The FreeCol team aims to create an Open Source version of
Colonization (released under the GPL). At first we'll try
to make an exact clone of Colonization. The visuals will
be brought up to date with more recent standards but will
remain clean, simple and functional. Certain new 'features'
will be implemented but the gameplay and the rules will be
exactly the same as the original game. Examples of modern
features are: an isometric map and multiplayer support.
