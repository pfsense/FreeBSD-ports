  message: <<EOM
Before running this software, you need to configure it first.  This is best
to be done with `install_umark_data.sh' script, which is installed here:

	%%DATADIR%%/install_umark_data.sh

It should be run from %%DATADIR%%.

If you want to manually configure the UT200x install paths, you may edit
your ~/.umarkrc file.  The ~/.umarkrc file format is as follows (in order):

	BuildNumber|/UT2003/Retail/install/path
	BuildNumber|/UT2004/Retail/install/path
	BuildNumber|/UT2003/Demo/install/path
	BuildNumber|/UT2004/Demo/install/path

If one of the lines says "n/a|n/a", it means that `install_umark_data.sh'
did not find where the respective version of the game is installed.  In this
case, you should manually enter the game build number and root installation
path.
