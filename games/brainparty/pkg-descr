made up of 36 minigames designed to push your brain to its limits

in a row and adds up your brain weight to see how smart you are,
and practise mode lets you play your favourite minigames as often
as you want. If you do well enough, there are six extra minigames
that can be unlocked as well as a new game mode designed to keep
