3rd Zigock II bots has been installed.

Due to the fact that game library (i.e. game.so file) is unable to read the
file system paths (i.e. %%Q2DIR%% in the client executable),
it will look for and write node files in the current directory.  So you have
to do the following (only once) in the directory where you want to run it
from (you could use ~/.quake2 for example):

  $ mkdir -p ~/.quake2/3zb2
  $ cd %%Q2DIR%%/3zb2
  $ cp -a 3ZBConfig.cfg 3ZBMaps.lst chctf chdtm ~/.quake2/3zb2
  $ chmod -R u+w ~/.quake2/3zb2

Then run it from the recently created directory.

  $ cd ~/.quake2
  $ quake2 +set game 3zb2

See the docs in %%DOCSDIR%% for help on using it.

Check the website for additional DM and CTF maps (respective routes section).
