HighMoon is a game similar to "Artillery" or "Worms" -- but it takes place
in the universe. There is a planet system between two flying saucers.
The gravitational fields of the planets and moons change inevitably each
ballistic curve. It is not easy to eliminate an enemy. If you miss it,
the shoots can change their direction and become dangerous to the attacker.

HighMoon can be played against a computer or a human opponent in many
planet systems.
