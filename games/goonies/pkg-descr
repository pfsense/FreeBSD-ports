Welcome to the Brain Games remake of the 8 bit classic game 'The
Goonies'. This game was made by Konami in 1986. There were both a
NES version and an MSX version of the game; this remake is based
on the MSX version.

This remake was made for the 2006 competition organized by Retro
Remakes. After having participated in 2003 (with Road Fighter, which
finished on the 7th place out of 83 entries), and in 2004 (with F-1
Spirit, gaining the 13th place amongst the 73 contestants), we
decided to give another go at the first prize! And, who knows....
