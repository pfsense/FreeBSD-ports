Suyimazu was created for the gui usage in the first place,
the gui can be opened via the commandline by typing Suyimazu
but also via a shortcut (if you have allowed to create one).

For terminal fans there are also some fast commands:

Examples:

    To install something use: 	Suyimazu Install Steam
    To launch something use: 	Suyimazu Launch Steam
    To uninstall something use: Suyimazu Uninstall Steam

Enjoy playing!
