Slump is a random map generator for FreeDoom that is based on David M. Chess'
SLIGE map generator.

Basically Slump is a fork of SLIGE that is optimized for making FreeDoom maps.
In particular, Slump only places monsters that the FreeDoom artists have drawn
in to maps; this way one can play FreeDoom without feeling that the game is
incomplete.
