I have ported the Wolfenstein missions to DOOM II, creating what is
essentially an improved and updated Wolfenstein. Each scenario is
painstakingly recreated as a DOOM II WAD, complete with all the Wolfenstein
textures, objects, sounds, and enemies. The result is a total conversion, a
complete Wolfenstein experience which takes full advantage of the DOOM engine.
There are even ambient sounds.

In addition to recreating the original missions, I have also created brand new
scenarios which go beyond the original scope and concept of Wolfenstein.
Scenarios such as Operation: Arctic Wolf, Operation: Rheingold, and the
Astrostein Trilogy take the Wolfenstein fan where no Wolfenstein has gone
before, immersing the player in adventures not possible with the original
Wolfenstein.
