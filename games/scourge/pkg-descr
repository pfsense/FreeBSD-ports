S.C.O.U.R.G.E. is a rogue-like game in the fine tradition of NetHack
and Moria It sports a graphical front-end, similar to glHack or the
Falcon's eye. I tried to design the 3D UI as a best of both worlds
from old to new: It lets you rotate the view, zoom in/out, view
special effects, etc. On the other hand I've always liked the
old-school isometric games like Exult or Woodward.
