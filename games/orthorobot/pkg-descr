Literally bridging the gap between 2D and 3D games, Ortho Robot is a
perspective based puzzle game, where you flatten the view to move across gaps.
Your objective is to reach the ending green block (either by standing directly
on it or standing on it in relative space). For some extra challenge, try to
collect all coins and perfect your time, steps and number of warps.
