Please note, this is an unofficial wrapper for the Steam client
and as such it is supported on a best effort basis.

Limitations:

- Sandbox is disabled for the web browser component.
- Valve Anti-Cheat doesn't work with FreeBSD < 13.
- No controller input, no streaming, no VR.
- No support for Linux Proton builds.

Additional dependencies:
- If you use an NVIDIA card, you need to install a suitable
  x11/linux-nvidia-libs(-xxx) port.

Steam setup:

1. Create a dedicated FreeBSD non-wheel user account for Steam. Switch to it.
2. Run `steam-install` to download the Steam bootstrap executable.
3. Run `steam` to download updates and start Steam.

For the list of tested Linux games see https://github.com/shkhln/linuxulator-steam-utils/wiki/Compatibility.

Native Proton setup (optional, semi-experimental):

1. Run `sudo pkg install wine-proton libc6-shim python3`.
2. Run `%%LOCALBASE%%/wine-proton/bin/pkg32.sh install wine-proton mesa-dri`.
3. In Steam install Proton 6.3 (appid 1580130).
4. Run `lsu-register-proton` to register emulators/wine-proton as a compatibility tool.
5. Restart Steam.
