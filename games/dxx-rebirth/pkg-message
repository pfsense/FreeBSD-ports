dxx-rebirth requires the original game files from Descent I and/or
Descent II to work properly.  These can come from an original CD or from
GOG.com.

If using the GOG.com version of Descent I, you must extract the files
from setup_descent_1.4a_(16596).exe using the innoextract package.

You can install it with "pkg install innoextract" or 
"portmaster archivers/innoextract".

The files will be in a directory named app. You must move the contents
of this directory to a directory named ~/.d1x-rebirth/Data

The eaisest way to do this is to follow these steps:
$ mkdir -p ~/.d1x-rebirth/Data
$ cp -R app/* ~/.d1x-rebirth/Data

You can then delete everything extracted from the exe.

If you own the GOG.com version of Descent II, follow the above steps
with the setup_descent_2_1.1_(16596).exe file and using
~/.d2x-rebirth/Data as the directory name.
