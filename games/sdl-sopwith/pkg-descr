This is a port of the classic computer game "Sopwith" to run on
modern computers and operating systems. It is named "SDL Sopwith"
as it was originally used the LibSDL graphics library. There is now
also a port to Gtk+, the widget library used by GNOME and there is
initial code written toward a backport allowing it to be run under
DOS, like the original.
