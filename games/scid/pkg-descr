Scid is a chess database application; with it you can browse databases of
chess games, edit games and search for games by various criteria.

Scid uses its own special three-file database format which is very compact
and fast, but it can convert to and from the standard PGN (Portable Game
Notation) format. Scids PGN window displays the text of the current game in
PGN format.

You can use Scid to add chess games to a database, using the keyboard or mouse
to enter moves.

You can also use Scid as a PGN file browser, by pasting PGN text into Scids
Import window or by opening a PGN file in Scid. However, PGN files cannot be
edited by Scid (it opens them read-only) and they use more memory and are
slower to load, so for large PGN files it is recommended that you create a
Scid database from them first with the pgnscid utility.
