PCSX ReARMed is yet another PCSX fork based on the PCSX-Reloaded
project, which itself contains code from PCSX, PCSX-df and
PCSX-Revolution.
This version is ARM architecture oriented and features MIPS->ARM
recompiler by Ari64, NEON GTE code and more performance improvements.
It was created for Pandora handheld, but should be usable on other
devices after some code adjustments (N900, GPH Wiz/Caanoo, PlayBook
versions are also available).

PCSX ReARMed features ARM NEON GPU by Exophase, that in many cases
produces pixel perfect graphics at very high performance. There is also
Una-i's GPU plugin from PCSX4ALL project, and traditional P.E.Op.S. one.
