The Egoboo Development team aims to create a fully free, 3D, Rogue
and Zelda-like in the spirit of Nethack. We continue to add new
features into the game, such as new levels, classes, items, monsters,
etc. The game is now in a stable and very playable state, but still
there are a lot of things to do before it reaches out of it's beta
stages.

The aim of the game is to build up your character in the World of
Bishopia and to find the five Sporks of Power. You have to vanquish
devious monsters, deadly traps, solve mindboggeling puzzles and
continuously build up a stronger and stronger character.
