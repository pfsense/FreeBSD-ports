LTris is just another clone of Tetris but IMHO a good one, so if you like
Tetris, download and play it!

Features:
     Tetris clone using SDL
     Sound
     Menu
     Controls can be redefined
     Block preview
     Starting level between 0 and 9
     Various backgrounds
     HighScores
     Nice graphics
     Smooth gameplay
     Cool effects (transparency, animations)
     Two player mode
     Two game modes

Two game modes?  Yes.  The "normal" mode is the one everbody knows well.  You
play as long as you can while the blocks are getting faster.  The second one
called "advanced" has some additional features.  First there is a new figure in
each new level and second later on there are suddenly appearing tiles and rows.
