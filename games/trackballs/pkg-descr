Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classical game Marble Madness on the
Amiga in the 80's. By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth filled with
vicious hammers, pools of acid and other obstacles the player collects points.
When the ball reaches the destination it continues at the next, more difficult
level - unless the time runs out.
