    OpenTTD requires the original Windows version of "Transport Tycoon
    Deluxe" data files in order to function.  Copy the following files
    to %%DATADIR%%/data/ (or better, $HOME/.openttd/data/)
    directory:

	sample.cat
	trg1r.grf
	trgcr.grf
	trghr.grf
	trgir.grf
	trgtr.grf

    If you want the TTD music, copy the gm/ folder from the Windows
    version of TTD to your OpenTTD folder (not your data folder).  The
    music from the DOS version does not work.

    Alternatively, you can use free data files, split into OpenGFX for
    graphics, OpenSFX for sounds, and OpenMSX for music.  They can be
    installed from corresponding `games/opengfx', `games/opensfx', and
   `games/openmsx' ports.

    If you are using a non-Latin language, you may see lots of `?'s on
    the screen.  Please open your configuration file and add desired
    fonts (file name with full path).  Bold fonts might look better:

	[misc]
	small_font =
	medium_font =
	large_font =

    Enjoy!!
