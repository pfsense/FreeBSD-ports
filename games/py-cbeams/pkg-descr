cbeams is a command-line program which draws pretty animated colored circles in
the terminal.

The feeling of the generated visuals could be described
with the following quote:

>    I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the
>    shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark, near the
>    Tannhauser Gate. All those moments will be lost, in time, like tears in
>    rain. Time to die.
