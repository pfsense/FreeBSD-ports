SuperTuxKart is a Free 3d kart racing game; we want to make the
game fun more than we want to make it realistic. You can play with
up to 4 friends on one PC racing against each other, or just try
to beat the computer.

See the great lighthouse or drive through the sand and visit the
pyramids. Race under water or in space, watching the stars passing
by. Have some rest under the palms on the beach (watching the other
karts overtaking you :) ). But don't fall in the volcano.

You can do a single race against other karts, compete in one of
several Grand Prix, or try to beat the high score in time trials
on your own.
