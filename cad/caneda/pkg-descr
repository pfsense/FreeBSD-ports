Caneda is an open source EDA software suite focused on ease of use and
portability.

Its main goal is to handle the complete design process: schematic capture,
simulation and circuit layout or PCB.

Caneda aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types, e.g. DC, AC,
S-parameter and harmonic balance analysis.
