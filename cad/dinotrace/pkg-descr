Dinotrace is a signal waveform tracing tool that supports traces in the form of
Verilog Value Change Dump (VCD), ASCII, Verilator, Tempest CCLI, COSMOS, Chango
and Decsim Binary. Dinotrace is also equipped with an interface to GNU Emacs.

Dinotrace was conceived in the early 1980's by Allen Gallotta at Digital
Equipment Corporation, who wrote the code and supported it through version 4.2.
When created, it was the first graphical display tool for the simulators being
designed at Digital.
