SPICE is a general-purpose circuit simulation program for nonlinear DC,
nonlinear transient, and linear AC analyses. Circuits may contain resistors,
capacitors, inductors, mutual inductors, independent voltage and current
sources, four types of dependent sources, lossless and lossy transmission
lines (two separate implementations), switches, uniform distributed RC
lines, and the five most common semiconductor devices: diodes, BJTs, JFETs,
MESFETs, and MOSFETs.

Patch Levels I and II (including a new spec command for spectral analysis)
and the level 2 JFET model are courtesy from the Macquarie University.
