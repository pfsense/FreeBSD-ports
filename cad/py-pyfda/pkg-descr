pyFDA is a GUI based tool in Python/Qt for analysing and designing discrete
time filters. The capability for generating Verilog and VHDL code for the
designed and quantized filters will be added in the next release.

Since the digital filter design is a research area with many unanswered
questions, this project is also a research project.
Please expect freezes in case of some parameter values.
