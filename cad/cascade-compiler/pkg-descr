Cascade is a novel solution to the problem that FPGAs take a long time to
program, with complex programs taking hours to be compiled to run on FPGA.
Cascade is a first just-in-time compiler for Verilog. Cascade executes code
immediately in a software simulator, and performs compilation in the
background. When compilation is finished, the code is moved into hardware, and
from the user's perspective it simply gets faster over time. Cascade's ability
to move code back and forth between software and hardware also makes it the
first platform to provide generic support for the execution of unsynthesizable
Verilog from hardware.
