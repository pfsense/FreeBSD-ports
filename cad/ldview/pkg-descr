LDView is a real-time 3D viewer for displaying LDraw models using
hardware-accellerated 3D graphics. For information on LDraw, please visit
www.ldraw.org, the centralized LDraw information site.

The program can read LDraw LDR/DAT files as well as MPD files. It then allows
you to rotate the model around to any angle with the mouse.
