Netgen is a tool for comparing netlists, a process known as LVS, which stands
for "Layout vs. Schematic". This is an important step in the integrated circuit
design flow, ensuring that the geometry that has been laid out matches the
expected circuit. Very small circuits can bypass this step by confirming circuit
operation through extraction and simulation. Very large digital circuits are
usually generated by tools from high-level descriptions, using compilers that
ensure the correct layout geometry. The greatest need for LVS is in large analog
or mixed-signal circuits that cannot be simulated in reasonable time. Even for
small circuits, LVS can be done much faster than simulation, and provides
feedback that makes it easier to find an error than does a simulation.
