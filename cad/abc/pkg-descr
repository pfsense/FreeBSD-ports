ABC is a growing software system for synthesis and verification of binary
sequential logic circuits appearing in synchronous hardware designs. ABC
combines scalable logic optimization based on And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs),
optimal-delay DAG-based technology mapping for look-up tables and standard
cells, and innovative algorithms for sequential synthesis and verification.

ABC provides an experimental implementation of these algorithms and a
programming environment for building similar applications. Future development
will focus on improving the algorithms and making most of the packages
stand-alone. This will allow the user to customize ABC for their needs as if
it were a tool-box rather than a complete tool.
