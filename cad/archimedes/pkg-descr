Archimedes is the GNU package for semiconductor device simulations that has been
released for the first time on 2005 under GPL. It has been created by Jean
Michel Sellier who is, since then, the leader of the project and the main
developer. It is a Free software and thus it can be copied, modified and
redistributed under GPL. This is the one of the big advantages of using
Archimedes.
