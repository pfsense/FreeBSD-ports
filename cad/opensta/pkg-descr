OpenSTA is a gate level static timing verifier. As a stand-alone executable it
can be used to verify the timing of a design using standard file formats.

* Verilog netlist
* Liberty library
* SDC timing constraints
* SDF delay annotation
* SPEF parasitics

OpenSTA uses a TCL command interpreter to read the design, specify timing
constraints and print timing reports.
