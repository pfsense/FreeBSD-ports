TOCHNOG is a free finite element program with many features. TOCHNOG
accepts free format input. Boundary conditions can be imposed at
geometrical entities, as well as nodes and elements.

Among the FE models supported are: differential equations (materials),
convection-diffusion equations, Stokes and Navier-Stokes (fluids),
elasticity (isotropy and transverse isotropy), plasticity (Von-Mises,
Mohr-Coulomb, etc.; plastic surfaces can be arbitrarily
combined). Residues in equations and error estimates for all data can
be printed or plotted using gnuplot/plotmtv, CalculiX or gmsh.

TOCHNOG supports a choice of description frames including Lagrangian,
Eulerian and arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian (AEL).
