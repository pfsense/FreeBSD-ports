K40 Whisperer is an alternative to the Laser Draw (LaserDRW) program that comes
with some Chinese laser cutters. It reads SVG and DXF files, interprets the
data and sends commands to the K40 controller to move the laser head and
control the laser accordingly. K40 Whisperer does not require a USB key
(dongle) to function.

Features:
- Reads SVG files and DXF files.
- Splits input design based on color formatting (red, blue).
- In SVG files blue and red paths are interpreted as vectors for vector
  engraving and cutting. Everything else is transferred as a raster image.
- In DXF files blue paths are interpreted as vector engrave (blue).
  Everything else is interpreted as vector cut (red).
- Performs cuts on features inside of other features before cutting the outside
  features. (If you cut the outside first the part might drop out of the stock
  material.)
- Converts gray scale images to halftone images to simulating varying levels of
  gray (i.e. engraving pictures). The Halftone option needs to be selected
  under "Raster"-"Settings" to enable halftoning.
