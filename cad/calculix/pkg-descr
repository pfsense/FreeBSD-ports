A Three-Dimensional Structural Finite Element Program

CalculiX Finite Element Models can be build, calculated and
post-processed. The pre- and post-processor is an interactive 3D-tool
using the openGL API.

Notice: The authors acknowledge that naming conventions and input style
formats for CalculiX are based on those used by ABAQUS, a proprietary,
general purpose finite element code developed and supported by Hibbitt,
Karlsson & Sorensen, Inc (HKS) and are used with kind permission from HKS.
Results obtained from CalculiX are in no way connected to ABAQUS.
