The Amaranth project provides an open-source toolchain for developing hardware
based on synchronous digital logic using the Python programming language, as
well as evaluation board definitions, a System on Chip toolkit, and more. It
aims to be easy to learn and use, reduce or eliminate common coding mistakes,
and simplify the design of complex hardware with reusable components.

The Amaranth toolchain consists of the Amaranth hardware definition language,
the standard library, the simulator, and the build system, covering all steps of
a typical FPGA development workflow. At the same time, it does not restrict the
designer's choice of tools: existing industry-standard (System)Verilog or VHDL
code can be integrated into an Amaranth-based design flow, or, conversely,
Amaranth code can be integrated into an existing Verilog-based design flow.
