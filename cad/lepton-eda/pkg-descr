Lepton EDA is a suite of free software tools for designing
electronics. It provides schematic capture, netlisting into
over 30 netlist formats, and many other features.
It was forked from the gEDA/gaf suite in late 2016 by most
of its active developers at that time.
It's backward compatible with its predecessor and supports
the same file format for symbols and schematics.
It's in active development and well supported.
