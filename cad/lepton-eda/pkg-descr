Lepton EDA is a suite of free software tools for designing
electronics. It provides schematic capture, netlisting into
over 30 netlist formats, and many other features.
It was forked from the gEDA/gaf suite in late 2016 by most
of its active developers at that time.
It's in active development and well supported.
