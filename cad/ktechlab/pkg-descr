KTechlab has been designed to be as easy to use and unintrusive as possible.
All components and FlowParts have context sensitive help, and simulating
electronics is as simple as dragging components onto the work area and creating
connectors that autoroute themselves between their pins. FlowCode allows users
new to PICs to instantly create their own programs, while the electronic
simulation allows stepping through a PIC's assembly program inside a circuit.
