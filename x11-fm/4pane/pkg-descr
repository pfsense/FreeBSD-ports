4Pane is a multi-pane, detailed-list file manager for Unix-like systems.
It is designed to be fully-featured without bloat, and aims for speed
rather than visual effects.  In addition to standard file manager things,
it offers multiple undo and redo of most operations (including deletions),
archive management including "virtual browsing" inside archives, multiple
renaming/duplication of files, terminal emulator, and user-defined tools.
