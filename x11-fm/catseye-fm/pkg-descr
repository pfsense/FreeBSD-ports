This is Cat'sEyE (catseye-fm), a filesystem browser using gtk+2.
Main goals: clear view, powerfull, no icons, fast.

Cat'sEyE gots its power by the configuration file where the user can
(but not has to) 'create' dialogs and build complicated commandlines
which Cat'sEyE calls to the Shell.
You can define how the items are called to some program: each item
(e.g. for viewing some pictures), all items (e.g. for listen to
some music) or processed in a list, calling one item after each
other waiting for the previouse item to finish.

FileShelfs help you to keep track of your data spread out
over the whole filesystem, but also belonging together such as
configfiles.
