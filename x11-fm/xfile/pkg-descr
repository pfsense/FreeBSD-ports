XFile is a compact file manager for Unix and alike systems running X11.
It presents the file system as is, without imaginary locations, trashcans etc.
XFile uses its own file type association database written in typical Unix/RC
file syntax. Mounting support for file systems defined in fstab, and integration
with mount daemons that manage a dedicated media directory is also included.

XFile is easily configurable and customizable with X resources. The Tools
dropdown menu can be populated with user defined commands, which may be run with
selected files, current directory and user specified parameters as arguments.

The application has no dependencies, save for X and Motif, and is built using
simple Makefiles. It's written in C, and the source code is freely available
under the terms of the X/MIT license.
