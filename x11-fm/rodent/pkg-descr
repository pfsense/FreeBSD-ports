Rodent is a fast, small and powerful file manager for the
GNU operating system (but it also works in BSD). That's one
way to look at it. Another way is to call it a graphic shell
(that's probably more accurate).

* Rodent wastes no space on menus or function buttons (display
  real estate is too valuable).
* All functionality is available through popup menu or keyboard
  action.
* Popup menu is context sensitive.
* Full lpterminal is available from keyboard.
* Functionality is extendible via plugin technology.
