TDFSB is a "3D - Filesystem Browser".  It reads directory information and
displays them as a 3D world, so you can take a walk through your file
system.  It also reads images, MPEG and MP3 files as well as some other
formats.

It is highly recommended that you have decent (hardware-accelerated) gfx
card, otherwise it may run very slow.
