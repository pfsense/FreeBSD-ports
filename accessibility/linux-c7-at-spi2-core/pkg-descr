This is the Gnome Accessibility Project's Assistive Technology
Service Provider Interface.  It allows accessibility applications
and assistive technologies to announce their respective existence
to each other.

This version of at-spi is a major break from previous versions.
It has been completely rewritten to use D-Bus rather than
ORBIT / CORBA for its transport protocol.
