This client library is designed to provide an ergonomic interface to
the myriad of potential speech providers that are installed in a given
session.
The API is inspired by the W3C Web Speech API. It serves several purposes:

- Provide an updated list of installed across all speech providers voices.
- Offer a "speaker" abstraction where utterances can be queued to speak.
- If no voice was explicitly chosen for an utterance, negotiate global
  user settings and language preferences to choose the most appropriate
  voice.
