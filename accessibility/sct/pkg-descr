This is a port of sct, a simple command-line utility written by Ted Unangst,
which can be used to control screen temperature. It exceeds at being much more
lightweight than similar software solutions like Redshift and f.lux. At the
same time it is easier to use than xrandr.

Sct takes temperature values in range 1000 to 10000, where 6500 is the default
value. Here are some usage examples:

 * Campfire style: `sct 4500`
 * Dust storm on Mars style: `sct 2000`
 * Coffee free all nighter style: `sct 8000`
 * Default style: `sct`
