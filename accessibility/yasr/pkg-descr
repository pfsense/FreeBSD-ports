YASR ("Yet Another Screen Reader") is an attempt at a lightweight,
portable screen reader. It works by opening a shell in a pty and
intercepting all user input/output, maintaining a window of what
should be on the screen by looking at the codes and text sent to the
screen. It thus uses no Linuxisms such as /dev/vcsa0 and does not
necessarily need to be setuid root (the only requirement being that
the user be able to access the tts device).
