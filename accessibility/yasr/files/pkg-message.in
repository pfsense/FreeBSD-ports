Yasr requires a text-to-speech engine to work. FreeBSD offers two: Festival
and FLite (Festival Lite). Edit the system configuration file
%%DATADIR%%/yasr.conf
or user configuration file ~/.yasr.conf and set "synthesizer" and
"synthesizer port".

NOTE: To use FLite requires the Emacspeak speech server eflite to be
installed.

EXAMPLES:

Festival
    synthesizer=festival
    sythesizer port=|%%LOCALBASE%%/bin/festival
Festival running as a server
    synthesizer=festival
    synthesizer port=127.0.0.1:1314
FLite
    synthesizer=Emacspeak server
    synthesizer port=|%%LOCALBASE%%/bin/eflite

See man page for more information.
