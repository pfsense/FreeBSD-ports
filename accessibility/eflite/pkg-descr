EFlite is a speech server for Emacspeak and other screen readers that allows
them to interface with Festival Lite, a free text-to-speech engine developed at
the CMU Speech Center as an off-shoot of Festival.  EFlite is still in beta,
but I have been using it successfully with Yasr to get speech on my notebook
under Linux without having to lug my Speak-out around.  It uses Festival Lite's
code to interface with the sound driver and, therefore, should work with some
versions of ALSA, but I have only tested it with the OSS sound drivers so far.
