Accerciser is an interactive Python accessibility explorer for the GNOME
desktop. It uses AT-SPI to inspect and control widgets, allowing you to check
if an application is providing correct information to assistive technologies
and automated test frameworks. Accerciser has a simple plugin framework which
you can use to create custom views of accessibility information.
