hyprsunset is a small utility to provide a blue light filter for your
system.

This method is preferred to screen shaders as it will not be captured
via recording / screenshots.

hyprsunset also provides a gamma filter, which can be used to adjust
perceived display brightness on monitors that do not support software
control, or to reduce perceived brightness below the monitor's
minimum.
