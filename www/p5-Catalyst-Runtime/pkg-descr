Catalyst is a web application framework. This means that you use it to
help build applications that run on the web, or that run using proto-
cols used for the web. Catalyst is designed to make it easy to manage
the various tasks you need to do to run an application on the web,
either by doing them itself, or by letting you "plug in" existing Perl
modules that do what you need.
