The Apache engines have been moved to a separate package: Please install
www/p5-Catalyst-Engine-Apache if you need Apache/mod_perl support.

The parts necessary to do development with Catalyst have been moved to
a separate package: Please install www/p5-Catalyst-Devel, if you need
to develop Catalyst-apps, as opposed to simply running them.

The majority of the documentation has been moved to a separate package as
well: Install www/p5-Catalyst-Manual for the tutorially goodness.
