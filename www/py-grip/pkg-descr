Grip (GitHub Readme Instant Preview) is a command-line server
application written in Python that uses the GitHub markdown API to
render a local readme file. The styles come directly from GitHub,
so you'll know exactly how it will appear. Changes you make to the
Readme will be instantly reflected in the browser without requiring
a page refresh.
