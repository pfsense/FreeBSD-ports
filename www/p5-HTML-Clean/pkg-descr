The majority of the web pages of the internet today are much larger than they
need to be. The reason for this is that HTML tends to be stored in a human
readable format, with indenting, newlines and comments.

However, all of these comments, whitespace etc. are ignored by the browser, and
needlessly lengthen download times.

Second, many people are using WYSIWYG HTML editors these days. This makes
creating content easy. However these editors can cause a number of compatibility
problems by tying themselves to a particular browser or operating system.

The HTML::Clean module encapsulates a number of HTML optimizations and cleanups.
The end result is HTML that loads faster, displays properly in more browsers.
Think of it as a compiler that translates HTML input into optimized machine
readable code.
