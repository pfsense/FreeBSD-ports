IMDbPY is a Python package useful to retrieve and manage the data of the IMDb
movie database.

IMDbPY aims to provide an easy way to access the IMDb's database using a Python
script. Platform-independent and written in pure Python, it's theoretically
independent from the data source (since IMDb provides two or three different
interfaces to their database). IMDbPY is mainly intended for programmers and
developers who want to build their Python programs using the IMDbPY package, but
some example scripts - useful for simple users - are included.
