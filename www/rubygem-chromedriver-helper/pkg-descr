chromedriver-helper installs an executable, chromedriver-helper, in your gem
path, and configures Selenium to invoke it as the web driver.

This script will, if necessary, download the appropriate binary for your
platform and install it into ~/.chromedriver-helper, then exec it. Easy peasy!

Individual projects can even select which version of chromedriver they want to
run.
