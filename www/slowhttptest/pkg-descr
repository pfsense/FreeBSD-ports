SlowHTTPTest is a highly configurable tool that simulates some Application
Layer Denial of Service attacks by prolonging HTTP connections in different
ways.

Use it to test your web server for DoS vulnerabilites, or just to figure out
how many concurrent connections it can handle. SlowHTTPTest works on majority
of Linux platforms, OS X and Cygwin - a Unix-like environment and command-line
interface for Microsoft Windows, and comes with a Dockerfile to make things even
easier.
