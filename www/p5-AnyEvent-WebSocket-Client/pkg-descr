AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client provides an interface to interact with a web server
that provides services via the WebSocket protocol in an AnyEvent context. It
uses Protocol::WebSocket rather than reinventing the wheel. You could use
AnyEvent and Protocol::WebSocket directly if you wanted finer grain control, but
if that is not necessary then this class may save you some time.
