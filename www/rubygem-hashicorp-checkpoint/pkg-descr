Checkpoint is an internal service at Hashicorp that we use to check version
information, broadcoast security bulletins, etc.

We understand that software making remote calls over the internet for any reason
can be undesirable. Because of this, Checkpoint can be disabled in all of our
software that includes it. You can view the source of this client to see that
we're not sending any private information.
