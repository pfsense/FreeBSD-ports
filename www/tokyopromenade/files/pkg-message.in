  message: <<EOM
1) Install an arbitrary web server which supports the CGI mechanism.
   Then, create a directory where CGI scripts can be executed. We call
   it the base directory, which contains some files of Tokyo Promenade.

   mkdir -p /path/to/the/base/directory
   cd /path/to/the/base/directory

2) Copy the CGI script and some configuration files into the base
   directory.

   cp %%PREFIX%%/libexec/promenade.fcgi .
   cp %%DATADIR%%/promenade.* .
   cp %%DATADIR%%/passwd.txt .

3) Create the database file where articles are stored.

   prommgr create promenade.tct

4) Import the help articles into the database.

   prommgr import promenade.tct %%DATADIR%%/misc/help-*.tpw

5) Create a directory where uploaded files are stored.

   mkdir upload

6) The CGI script should have permissions to read/write the database
   file, the upload directory and the password file. To achieve the
   purpose, one of the following is suggested.

   Change the owner:
      sudo chown -R www:nobody /path/to/the/base/directory

   Forget the security:
      chmod -R 777 /path/to/the/base/directory

   Run the web server by the same user of the owner of the base
   directory.

   Change the user ID of the CGI script by using a feature of the
   web server like suExec.

7) Run the FastCGI script.

   %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/spawn-fcgi -a 127.0.0.1 -p 8889 \
                             -d /path/to/the/base/directory \
                             -f /path/to/the/base/directory/promenade.fcgi

8) Configure your web browser with FastCGI-specific directives. For
   Apache, this might look like:

   FastCgiExternalServer /path/to/the/base/directory/promenade.fcgi \
      -host 127.0.0.1:8889

When all steps above are finished, access the CGI script with a Web
browser.
