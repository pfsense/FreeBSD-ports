A slick app that supports automatic or manual queryset caching and automatic
granular event-driven invalidation.

It uses redis as backend for ORM cache and redis or filesystem for simple
time-invalidated one.

And there is more to it:

* Decorators to cache any user function or view as a queryset or by time
* Extensions for django and jinja2 templates
* Transparent transaction support
* Dog-pile prevention mechanism
* A couple of hacks to make django faster
