Libevhtp was created as a replacement API for Libevent's current HTTP API.
The reality of libevent's http interface is that it was created as a JIT
server, meaning the developer never thought of it being used for creating a
full-fledged HTTP service. The maintainer is under the impression that the
libevent http API was designed almost as an example of what you can do with
libevent. It's not Apache in a box, but more and more developers are
attempting to use it as such.
