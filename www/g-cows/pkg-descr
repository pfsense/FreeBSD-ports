This is a port of G-Cows, a software project consisting in:
- definition of a scripting language designed for creation of web sites (Cows);
- interpreter for the scripting language (cows);
- a makefile generator (cows-mkgen).

Cows is a scripting language whose main goal is to make the creation
and updating of a web site faster, more flexible and less prone to
errors without relying on server-side technologies.

Cows allows to use your Unix background and your favorite tools while
creating a site: you can traverse the whole directory tree with
`find', extract informations with `grep', build complex pipelines,
include external scripts and programs written in every language whose
interpreter or compiler is installed on your system.

Even if you use server side technology, you can still appreciate Cows
for every task not relying on dynamic change of your site's contents
mixing Cows, PHP, custom Apache modules, application servers etc.

Cows gives the best results when used in conjunction with the Make
utility, available on all Unix systems.
