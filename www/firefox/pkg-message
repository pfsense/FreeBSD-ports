## Missing features

Some features found on Windows, macOS and Linux are not implemented:

- Native audio (requires OSS backend, feature parity with ALSA or PulseAudio)
- Encrypted Media Extensions (requires Widevine CDM binary)
- Process sandboxing (requires Capsicum backend)
- Reduced memory usage (requires mozjemalloc)
- Crash Reporter (requires Google Breakpad and reproducible builds)
- Performance profiling (requires GeckoProfiler)
- Gamepad API (requires libusbhid backend)
- WebVR (requires open source runtime)
- TCP fast open
- `about:networking` (requires link state notification)

## Audio backend

To select non-default audio backend open `about:config` page and
create `media.cubeb.backend` preference. Supported values are: `alsa`,
`jack`, `pulse`, `pulse-rust`, `sndio`. Currently used backend can be
inspected on `about:support` page.

Microphone selection only works in `pulse` and `pulse-rust` backends.
Other backends are limited to `default` which is usually `/dev/dsp`,
so use virtual_oss to reroute microphones from non-default devices.

## smb:// issues
Network group, machine, and share browsing does not work correctly.

## sftp://
Only sftp access using public key authentication works. To easily
setup public key authentication to `remote_host`:

    $ ssh-keygen
    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh remote_host "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

The SSH server on `remote_host` must allow pub key authentication.
