net-http-persistent manages persistent connections using Net::HTTP including a
thread pool for connecting to multiple hosts. Using persistent HTTP connections
can dramatically increase the speed of HTTP. Creating a new HTTP connection for
every request involves an extra TCP round-trip and causes TCP congestion
avoidance negotiation to start over. Net::HTTP supports persistent connections
with some API methods but does not make setting up a single persistent
connection or managing multiple connections easy. Net::HTTP::Persistent wraps
Net::HTTP and allows you to focus on how to make HTTP requests.
