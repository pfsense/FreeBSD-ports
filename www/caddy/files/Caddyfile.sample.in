# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace the line below with your
# domain name.

# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
localhost {
		# Set this path to your site's directory:
		root * %%WWWDIR%%

		# Enable the static file server:
		file_server

		# Set up a reverse proxy:
		# reverse_proxy localhost:8080

		# Serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
		# php_fastcgi localhost:9000

		# Enable logging:
		log {
				output file /var/log/caddy/access.log
				# Caddy's structured log format:
				format json
				# Or, for Common Log Format:
				# format single_field common_log
		}
}

# Caddy will automatically obtain ACME certs for domains
# example.com {
#     root * /path/to/example.com
#     file_server
# }

# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
