To enable caddy:

- Edit %%ETCDIR%%/Caddyfile
  See https://caddyserver.com/docs/
- Add caddy_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf

%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/caddy has the following defaults:

- Server log: /var/log/caddy/caddy.log
  (runtime messages, NOT an access.log)
- Automatic SSL certificate storage: /var/db/caddy/data/caddy/
- Runs as root:wheel (you can run as another user, like www,
  but caddy will be unable to bind to low-numbered ports,
  including 80 and 443)
