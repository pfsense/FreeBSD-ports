This add-on module allows the apache web server to use a MySQL database
for user and/or group authentication. For large user lists this can offer
a significate speed up over apache's standard flat file format.

There is a different version of mod_auth_mysql in the ports tree with
different configuration. Unfortunatly this version has a bug if used on
a system which has more than one authentification databases. You may have
to look which version fits your requirements.
