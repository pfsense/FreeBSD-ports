CGI::Application::Plugin::TT adds support for the popular Template
Toolkit engine to your CGI::Application modules by providing several
helper methods that allow you to process template files from within
your runmodes.

It complements the support for HTML::Template that is built into
CGI::Application through the load_tmpl method.  It also provides a few
extra features than just the ability to load a template.
