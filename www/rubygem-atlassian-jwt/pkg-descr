In order to access the Atlassian Connect REST APIs, an app authenticates using a
JSON Web Token (JWT). The token is generated using the app's secret key and
contains a claim which includes the app's key and a hashed version of the API
URL the app is accessing. This gem simplifies generating the claim.

This gem provides helpers for generating Atlassian specific JWT claims. It also
exposes the ruby-jwt gem's encode and decode methods.
