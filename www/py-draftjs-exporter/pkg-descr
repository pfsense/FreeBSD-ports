Draft.js exporter is a library to convert rich text from Draft.js raw
ContentState to HTML.

It is developed alongside the Draftail rich text editor, for Wagtail.

Draft.js is a rich text editor framework for React. Its approach is different
from most rich text editors because it does not store data as HTML, but rather
in its own representation called ContentState. This exporter is useful when the
ContentState to HTML conversion has to be done in a Python ecosystem.
