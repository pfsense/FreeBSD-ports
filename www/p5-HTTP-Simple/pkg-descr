HTTP::Simple is a wrapper of HTTP::Tiny that provides simplified functions for
performing HTTP requests in a similar manner to LWP::Simple, but with slightly
more useful error handling. For full control of the request process and response
handling, use HTTP::Tiny directly.

IO::Socket::SSL is required for HTTPS requests with HTTP::Tiny.

Request methods that return the body content of the response will return a byte
string suitable for directly printing, but that may need to be decoded for text
operations.

The HTTP::Tiny object used by these functions to make requests can be accessed
as $HTTP::Simple::UA (for example, to configure the timeout, or replace it with
a compatible object like HTTP::Tinyish).

The JSON encoder used by the JSON functions defaults to a JSON::PP instance, and
can be accessed as $HTTP::Simple::JSON.
