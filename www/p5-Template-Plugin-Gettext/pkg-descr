Template::Plugin::Gettext offers an end-to-end localization and
internationalization solution for the Template Toolkit 2. It consists of a
plugin that offers translation functions inside templates and a string extractor
xgettext-tt2 that extracts translatable strings from templates and writes them
to PO files (or rather a .pot file in PO format). The string extractor
xgettext-tt2 is fully customizable and also usable for other i18n plugins or
frameworks for the Template Toolkit.
