Command line tool to help you work with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).  Like
most JWT command line tools out there, you can decode almost any JWT
header and claims body.  Unlike any that I've found, however, jwt-cli
allows you to encode a new JWT with nearly any piece of data you can
think of.  Custom header values (some), custom claim bodies (as long
as it's JSON, it's game), and using any secret you need.
