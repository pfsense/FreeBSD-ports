Anubis is a web proxy that protects upstream resources from scraper bots
by using a short hash-based proof-of-work challenge. It "weighs the soul of
your connection" to determine if you're a legitimate user or an automated bot.

Anubis serves as a protective layer for websites that are being aggressively
scraped by AI bots and other automated systems that don't respect robots.txt
standards. It provides an alternative to services like Cloudflare when those
options aren't available or desired.

The proof-of-work system requires clients to solve a computational challenge
before accessing protected content, effectively deterring most automated
scrapers while allowing legitimate users through with minimal disruption.

It should be noted that Anubis may cause problems for accessibility of
protected websites, potentially confusing screen readers for blind users,
or other problems for assisted interaction. Please consider carefully.
