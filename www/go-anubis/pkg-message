  message: <<EOM
Anubis has been installed! Typically anubis is run behind a proxy, such as
nginx, caddy, haproxy, or similar, that passes the `x-real-ip` header to
anubis, which runs by default on port 8923. You will need to supply the
target url that you are protecting.

Amend rc.conf as required. For example:

anubis_enable=YES
anubis_args="-target http://localhost:4000/myapp -bind :8923"
