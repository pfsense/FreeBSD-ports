Falkon is a new-ish and very fast QtWebEngine browser. It aims to be a
lightweight web browser available on all major platforms. Falkon
has all standard functions you expect from a web browser. It includes
bookmarks, history (both also in sidebar) and tabs. Beyond that, you
block ads with a builtin AdBlock plugin, block Flash content with
Click2Flash and edit the local CA Certificates database with an SSL Manager.

Falkon has a wide range of features supported by KDE Frameworks
and many integration points with KDE Plasma. A "-qtonly" flavor is
available without these features:
- spellchecking
- word completion
- crash reporting
- progress notifications
- KIO (virtual filesystem) support
- wallet integration
- content-sharing
