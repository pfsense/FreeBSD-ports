The OwnTracks Recorder is a lightweight program for storing and accessing
location data published via MQTT (or HTTP) by the OwnTracks apps. It is a
compiled program which is easy to install and operate even on low-end hardware,
and it doesn't require an external database.

There are two main components: the Recorder obtains data via MQTT subscribes or
HTTP POST, stores the data in plain files and serve it via its built-in REST
API, and the ocat command-line utility reads stored data in a variety of
formats.
