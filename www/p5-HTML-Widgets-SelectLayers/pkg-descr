This module implements an HTML widget with multiple layers.  Only one
layer is visible at any given time, controlled by a <SELECT> box.

The HTML generated by this module uses JavaScript, but nevertheless
attempts to be as cross-browser as possible, testing for features via
DOM support rather than specific browsers or versions.
