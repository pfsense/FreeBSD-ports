Web Adjuster, Annotator Generator and TermLayout

These are tools for applying custom processing to Web pages,
particularly useful for mobile browsers that do not support
browser extensions.

* Web Adjuster is a domain-rewriting proxy that can inject
  Javascript and/or CSS into every page, as well as running
  the text through an arbitrary filter command;

* Annotator Generator is an examples-driven generator of fast
  text annotators (that add language-learning hints to text):
  these can be used as filters in Web Adjuster;

* TermLayout displays complex Web layouts on text terminals.
