This perl module provides an Active Server Pages port to the Apache HTTP Server
with perl as the host scripting language. Active Server Pages is a web
application platform that originated with the Microsoft IIS server. Under Apache
for both Win32 and Unix, it allows a developer to create dynamic web
applications with session management and perl code embedded in static html
files.

This is a portable solution, similar to ActiveState PerlScript and MKS PScript
implementation of perl for IIS ASP. Work has been done and will continue to make
ports to and from these other implementations as smooth as possible.

This module works under the Apache HTTP Server with the mod_perl module enabled.
See https://www.apache.org/ and https://perl.apache.org/ for further
information.

section.
