WebFlash is a library to display "flash" messages in python web
applications. These messages are usually used to provide feedback
to the user (eg: you changes have been saved, your credit card
number has been stolen, ...). One important characteristic they
must provide is the ability to survive a redirect (ie: display the
message in a page after being redirected from a form submission).
