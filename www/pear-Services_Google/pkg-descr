pear-Services_Google is a pear class that provides access to the Google
SOAP Web APIs.  It allows easy access to the Google SOAP Web APIs for the
search engine, spelling suggestions, and cache.

Please note that as of December 5, 2006 Google is no longer issuing new
API keys for the SOAP search API, so this package is only for developers
which has an API key already.
