Data hoarder's dream come true: bundle any web page into
a single HTML file. You can finally replace that gazillion
of open tabs with a gazillion of .html files stored somewhere
on your precious little drive.

Unlike the conventional "Save page as", monolith not only saves
the target document, it embeds CSS, image, and JavaScript assets
all at once, producing a single HTML5 document that is a joy to
store and share.

If compared to saving websites with wget -mpk, this tool embeds all
assets as data URLs and therefore lets browsers render the saved page
exactly the way it was on the Internet, even when no network connection
is available.
