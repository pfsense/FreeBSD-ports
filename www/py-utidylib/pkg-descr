This is fork of uTidylib with permission with original author. Originally it
incorporated patches from Debian and other distributions, now it also brings
compatibility with recent html-tidy versions and works with Python 3.

This is uTidylib, the Python wrapper for the HTML cleaning library named
TidyLib. It supports both original Tidy and new HTML5 enabled Tidy.
