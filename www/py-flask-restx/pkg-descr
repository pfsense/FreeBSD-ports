Flask-RESTX is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly
building REST APIs. Flask-RESTX encourages best practices with minimal
setup. If you are familiar with Flask, Flask-RESTX should be easy to
pick up. It provides a coherent collection of decorators and tools to
describe your API and expose its documentation properly using Swagger.

Flask-RESTX is a community driven fork of Flask-RESTPlus.
