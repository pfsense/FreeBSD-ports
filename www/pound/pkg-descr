The Pound program is a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTPS front-end for
Web server(s). Pound was developed to enable distributing load among several
Web-servers, and to allow for a convenient SSL wrapper for those Web servers
that do not offer it natively. Pound is distributed under the GPL -- no
warranty, it's free to use, copy and give away.
