     o You can find the configuration files for this package in the
       directory %%PREFIX%%/etc/e2guardian.

       Note:
       If you just updated your e2guardian installation from an earlier version,
       make sure to check your e2guardian.conf and e2guardianf[1..9].conf 
       configuration files against the respective e2giardian.conf.sample 
       and e2guardianf1.conf.sample files.
       Do not forget to check/configure log rotation and compression- read
       newsyslog(8) man page for details.

     o Running of e2guardian and squid on the same machine is common configuration.
       In order to get reliable and fast-working configuration  on heavy loaded
       systems with real-time content checking with antivirus you might want to set
       the following tunables (see tuning(7) man page for details prior to tuning):

       **** /boot/loader.conf ****
         kern.ipc.msgmnb=8192
         kern.ipc.msgssz=64
         kern.ipc.msgtql=2048
         net.inet.tcp.syncache.hashsize=1024
         net.inet.tcp.syncache.bucketlimit=100

       **** /etc/sysctl.conf ****
         net.inet.ip.portrange.last=65535
         net.inet.ip.portrange.first=1024
         net.inet.tcp.delayed_ack=1
         net.inet.tcp.nolocaltimewait=1
         kern.ipc.soacceptqueue=8192
         net.local.stream.recvspace=65535
         net.local.stream.sendspace=65535
         net.inet.ip.portrange.randomized=0
         #Skip feeding /dev/random from network.
         kern.random.harvest.mask=399
          
         Also do not forget to raise kern.threads.max_threads_per_proc to the value
         higher then httpworkers in e2giardian.conf.

     o As of v.4 e2guardian is a single process multithreaded application.
       It might be reasonable to use sysutils/fsc or similar tools to control 
       it's status.
