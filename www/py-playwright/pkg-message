  message: <<EOM
You installed playwright: API to automate web browsers.

playright expects Linuxlator to be initialized because it
downloads and runs Linux binaries for web browsers and
ffmpeg.
playwright is known to work with linux_base-rl9.

playright is supposed to work with 3 browsers: Chrome, Firefox, WebKit.

Chrome is currently broken: https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=289285
WebKit is also broken due to missing dependencies.

You are expected to run the command 'playwright install' to download
browser binaries before you can use playwright.
