This middleware provides a convenient way to modify requests in flight in Plack
apps. Rewrite rules are simply written in Perl, which means everything that can
be done with mod_rewrite can be done with this middleware much more intuitively
(if in syntactically wordier ways). Its primary purpose is rewriting paths, but
almost anything is possible very easily.
