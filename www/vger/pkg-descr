Vger is a gemini server supporting chroot, virtualhosts, CGI, default language
choice, redirections and MIME types detection.

Vger design is relying on inetd and a daemon to take care of TLS. The idea is
to delegate TLS and network to daemons which proved doing it correctly, so vger
takes its request from stdin and output the result to stdout.
