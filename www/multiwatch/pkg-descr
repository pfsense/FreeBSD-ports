Multiwatch forks multiple instance of one application and keeps them
running; it is made to be used with spawn-fcgi, so all forks share the same
fastcgi socket (no webserver restart needed if you increase/decrease the
number of forks), and it is easier than to setup multiple daemontool
supervised instances.
