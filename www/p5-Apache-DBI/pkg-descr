These modules are supposed to be used with the Apache server together
with an embedded perl interpreter like mod_perl.  They provide support
for basic authentication and authorization as well as support for
persistent database connections via Perl's Database Independent
Interface (DBI).

o AuthDBI.pm provides authentication and authorization:

- optional shared cache for passwords to minimize database load -
configurable cleanup-handler deletes outdated entries from the cache

o DBI.pm provides persistent database connections:

- connections can be established during server-startup - configurable
rollback to ensure data integrity - configurable verification of the
connections to avoid time-outs.
