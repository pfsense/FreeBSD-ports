Jitsi Meet is an open-source (Apache) WebRTC JavaScript application that uses 
Jitsi Videobridge to provide high quality, secure and scalable video 
conferences.

The Jitsi Meet client runs in your browser, without installing anything else 
on your computer. You can try it out at https://meet.jit.si.

Jitsi Meet allows very efficient collaboration. Users can stream their desktop 
or only some windows. It also supports shared document editing with Etherpad.
