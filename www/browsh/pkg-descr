Browsh is a fully-modern text-based browser. It renders anything that a modern
browser can; HTML5, CSS3, JS, video and even WebGL. Its main purpose is to be
run on a remote server and accessed via SSH/Mosh or the in-browser HTML service
in order to significantly reduce bandwidth and thus both increase browsing
speeds and decrease bandwidth costs.
