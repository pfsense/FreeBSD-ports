CGI::Session::ExpireSessions is a pure Perl module.

It deletes CGI::Session-type sessions which have passed their use-by date.

It works with CGI::Session-type sessions in a database or in disk files,
but does not appear to work with CGI::Session::PureSQL-type sessions.

The recommended way to use this module is via method expire_sessions(),
which requires CGI::Session V 4 or later.
