  message: <<EOM
The nginx flavor of this port installs passenger core binaries only,
to make it works with nginx make sure www/nginx or www/nginx-devel
port has been compiled with third-party PASSENGER module support and
installed into a system.



Please edit a nginx configuration file, and add these lines:

   server {
       root %%PASSENGER_INSTALL_DIR%%;
       passenger_enabled on;
       passenger_ruby %%RUBY%%;
       passenger_sticky_sessions on;
   }
   
Once nginx restarts it's possible to deploy a Ruby on Rails
application without any further Ruby on Rails-specific configuration!
