WWW::OAuth implements OAuth 1.0 request authentication according to RFC 5849
(sometimes referred to as OAuth 1.0A). It does not implement the user agent
requests needed for the complete OAuth 1.0 authorization flow; it only
prepares and signs requests, leaving the rest up to your application. It can
authenticate requests for LWP::UserAgent, Mojo::UserAgent, HTTP::Tiny, and
can be extended to operate on other types of requests.
