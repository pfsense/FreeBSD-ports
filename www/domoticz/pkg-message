Notice:
 This port runs per default using uid:gid domoticz:domoticz to
 avoid security problems.

 Some code of Domoticz may needs root access. If you are ok with
 that change the following rc.conf to:

domoticz_user="root"
domoticz_group="wheel"

 And restart domoticz.

If you have issues with domoticz listen option, you can add
 net.inet6.ip6.v6only=0 to /etc/sysctl.conf
