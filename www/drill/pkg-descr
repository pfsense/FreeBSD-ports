Drill is a HTTP load testing application written in Rust. The main goal for
this project is to build a really lightweight tool as alternative to other
that require JVM and other stuff.

You can write benchmark files, in YAML format, describing all the stuff you
want to test.

It was inspired by Ansible syntax because it is really easy to use and extend.
