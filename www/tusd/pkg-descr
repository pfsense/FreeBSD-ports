tusd is the official reference implementation of the tus resumable upload
protocol. The protocol specifies a flexible method to upload files to remote
servers using HTTP. The special feature is the ability to pause and resume
uploads at any moment allowing to continue seamlessly after e.g. network
interruptions.
