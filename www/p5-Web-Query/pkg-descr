Web::Query is a yet another scraping framework, have a jQuery like interaface.

Yes, I know ingy's pQuery. But it's just a alpha quality. It doesn't works.
Web::Query built at top of the CPAN modules, HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath,
LWP::UserAgent, and HTML::Selector::XPath.

So, this module uses HTML::Selector::XPath, then this module only supports CSS3
selector supported by HTML::Selector::XPath. Web::Query doesn't support jQuery's
extended quries(yet?).
