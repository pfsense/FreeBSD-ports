CGI::Ajax is an object-oriented module that provides a unique
mechanism for using perl code asynchronously from javascript-enhanced
web pages.  You would commonly use CGI::Ajax in AJAX/DHTML-based
web applications.  CGI::Ajax unburdens the user from having to write
any javascript, except for having to associate an exported method
with a document-defined event (such as onClick, onKeyUp, etc). Only
in the more advanced implementations of a exported perl method would
a user need to write any javascript.
