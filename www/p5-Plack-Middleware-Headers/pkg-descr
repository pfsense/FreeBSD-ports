This Plack::Middleware simplifies creation (set or append), deletion (unset),
and modification (set) of PSGI response headers. The modification can be
enabled based on response code (code) or existing response headers(when).
Use Plack::Middleware::Conditional to enable the middleware based in
request headers.
