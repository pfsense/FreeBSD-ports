1) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   Alias /xoops %%WWWDIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%WWWDIR%%/>
      AllowOverride None
      Require all granted
   </Directory>

2) Visit your XOOPS site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/xoops/htdocs/), and you should
   be taken to the install script, which will lead
   you through creating a config file and then
   setting up XOOPS.
