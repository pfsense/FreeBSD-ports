Notes:

1.  SuiteCRM requires that you increase the default PHP memory limit to 128M.
    in the php.ini file.
    memory_limit = 128M	; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume

2.  In order to get Apache or your preferred web server to recognise Suite
    Community Edition's location on your disk, you'll need to put the
    following line (or the equivalent) into the web server configuration:

Alias /suitecrm %%WWWDIR%%
<Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
	AllowOverride None
	Require all granted
</Directory>
