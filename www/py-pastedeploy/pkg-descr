Load, configure, and compose WSGI applications and servers

Paste Deployment is a system for finding and configuring WSGI applications and
servers. For WSGI application consumers it provides a single, simple function
(loadapp) for loading a WSGI application from a configuration file or a Python
Egg. For WSGI application providers it only asks for a single, simple entry
point to your application, so that application users don't need to be exposed to
the implementation details of your application.

The result is something a system administrator can install and manage without
knowing any Python, or the details of the WSGI application or its container.

This tool provides code to load WSGI applications and servers from URIs; these
URIs can refer to Python Eggs for INI-style configuration files. Paste Script
provides commands to serve applications based on this configuration file.
