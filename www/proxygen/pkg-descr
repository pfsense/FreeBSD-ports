Proxygen comprises the core C++ HTTP abstractions used at Facebook. Internally,
it is used as the basis for building many HTTP servers, proxies, and clients.
This release focuses on the common HTTP abstractions and our simple HTTPServer
framework. Future releases will provide simple client APIs as well. The
framework supports HTTP/1.1, SPDY/3, SPDY/3.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3. The goal is
to provide a simple, performant, and modern C++ HTTP library.
