Writing RESTful apps is a good thing, but if you're also trying to support web
browsers, you're probably going to need some hackish workarounds. This module
provides one such workaround for your Plack applications.

Specifically, you can also use a header named X-HTTP-Method-Override (as used by
Google for its APIs) override the POST request method. Or you can add a
parameter named x-tunneled-method to your form action's query. Either way, the
overriding works only via POST requests, not GET.

If either of these attributes are available in a POST request, the
REQUEST_METHOD key of the Plack environment hash will be replaced with its
value. This allows your apps to override any HTTP method over POST. If your
application needs to know that such overriding has taken place, the original
method is stored under the plack.original_request_method key in the Plack
environment hash.

The list of methods you can specify are: GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS,
TRACE and CONNECT.
