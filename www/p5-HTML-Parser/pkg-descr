This is a collection of modules that parse HTML text documents. These
modules used to be part of the libwww-perl distribution, but are now
unbundled in order to facilitate a separate development track.  Bug
reports and discussions about these modules can still be sent to the
<libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu> mailing list.  Remember to also take a look at
the HTML-Tree module collection that create and extract information from
HTML syntax trees.
