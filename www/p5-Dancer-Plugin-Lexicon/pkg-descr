Dancer::Plugin::Lexicon uses Locale::Maketext::Lexicon to provide I18N
functionality to your Dancer application.

Translations are stored in PO or MO (compiled PO) gettext files in the
"languages/" dir. You can generate or update your PO files by
automatically extracting translatable strings from your code and
templates with xgettext.pl.

The user's preferred language can be auto-detected from their browser
settings, and the current language is automatically stored in the user's
session. Including "lang=$lang_tag" in the query string change the
user's language.
