Basecamp is a web based project collaboration tool that makes it
simple to communicate and collaborate on projects. Basecamp is built
on the Ruby on Rails platform but provides a webservice API to many of
the application functions. WebService::Basecamp is a Perl interface to
the Basecamp web service API.

For more information on Basecamp, visit the Basecamp website.
http://www.basecamphq.com.

This module does much of the heavy lifting for you when accessing the
Basecamp API. Once initialising a WebService::Basecamp object you can
access the API function via method calls. The module takes care of the
creation and parsing of the XML (using XML::Simple) that relays the
data across the web service, however there is an option to access the
XML directly (see new()).

The documentation for this module is based on the Basecamp API docs
available at http://www.basecamphq.com/api. It is recommended you read
the official docs to become familiar with the data reference.
