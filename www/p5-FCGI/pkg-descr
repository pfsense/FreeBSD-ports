This the FCGI module for perl5 which enables CGI scripts to take
advantage of servers that are FastCGI-enabled. This module does not abstract
the writing of CGIs themselves, for that you should refer to the p5-CGI
module. For more information about FastCGI, the performance enhancements it
offers, and how to write scripts using it, visit their web site at
