Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a socket
for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of IO::Socket::INET, so
you can perform socket operations directly on it too.

The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is another
IO::Socket::INET subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this object will
read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The ClientConn
object also provide methods to send back various responses.

This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note that
the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the HTTP/1.1
protocol.
