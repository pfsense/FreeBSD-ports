In order to install GeneWeb in a user's public_html directory, please run:
	%%DATADIR%%/install.sh
OR from directory to install in, run:
	cp -a %%DATADIR%%/distribution/ .
	./gwsetup

Sample rc-script %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/gwd has been provided to help run gwd
as a daemon process. Adjust it to suit your needs, and add gwd_enable="YES"
to your /etc/rc.conf to enable gwd to run automatically upon reboot.

Unfortunately, the documentation that was present with earlier GeneWeb
versions has been dropped since 6.02. Please refer to the GeneWeb wiki
http://opensource.geneanet.org/projects/geneweb/wiki
and/or to the GeneWeb mailing list GeneWeb@yahoogroups.com if you need
help.

Main Makefile in GeneWeb 6.07 does not build the experimental GUI, however
it remains in the codebase. GTK2 option is being retained in this port in
case the GUI becomes part of the main Makefile again in a later version.

If you notice odd failures, e.g., when editing a family, make sure you are
using an up-to-date template. Additional attributes, e.g., occupation got
added around v6.06, and if your template does not include this, you will
likely experience problems as the code throws an exception when trying to
edit a family.
