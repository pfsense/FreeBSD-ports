Gumbo is an implementation of the HTML5 parsing algorithm implemented as a pure
C99 library with no outside dependencies.

Goals and features of the C library:
 - Fully conformant with the HTML5 spec.
 - Robust and resilient to bad input.
 - Simple API that can be easily wrapped by other languages.
   (This is one of such wrappers.)
 - Support for source locations and pointers back to the original text.
   (Not exposed by this implementation at the moment.)
 - Relatively lightweight, with no outside dependencies.
 - Passes all html5lib-0.95 tests.
 - Tested on over 2.5 billion pages from Google's index.
