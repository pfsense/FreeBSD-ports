Streamlit builds upon three simple principles:

Embrace scripting:

Build an app in a few lines of code with our magically simple API. Then
see it automatically update as you iteratively save the source file.

Weave in interaction:

Adding a widget is the same as declaring a variable. No need to write a
backend, define routes, handle HTTP requests, connect a frontend, write
HTML, CSS, JavaScript.


Deploy instantly:

Effortlessly share, manage and deploy your apps, directly from Streamlit.
