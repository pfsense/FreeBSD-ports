1 Please keep in mind that
heavily used ILIAS installation can cause huge growth
of your log file, so remember to disable notices logging
in your PHP installation.

2 Also, this installation process has installed everything
that is needed for ILIAS to run properly with basic
functionality, but to broaden it you will have to install
third party software like Sun Java, HTMLdoc, LaTeX or
some virus scanner by yourself.

3 Add the following to your Apache configuration file
   httpd.conf, and restart the server:

   Alias /ilias %%WWWDIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%WWWDIR%%/>
      AllowOverride None
      Require all granted
   </Directory>

4 After installation, you should use 'composer install'
in the directory %%WWWDIR%%/libs/composer.

5 Edit the config.json file and run ilias Setup on the commang-line
in directory %%WWWDIR%%:
  $ sudo -u www -g www php setup/setup.php install ../iliasfiles/config.json

6 If all is OK, you can login into the system with
username/root and password/homer as the administrator.
