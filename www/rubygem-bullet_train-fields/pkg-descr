Bullet Train includes a collection of view partials that are intended to DRY-up
as much redundant presentation logic as possible for different types of form
fields without taking on a third-party dependency like Formtastic.

These form field partials standardize and centralize the following behavior
across all form fields that use them:
- Apply theme styling and classes.
- Display any error messages for a specific field inline under the field itself.
- Display a stylized asterisk next to the label of fields that are known to be
  required.
- Any labels, placeholder values, and help text are defined in a standardized
  way in the model's localization Yaml file.
- For fields presenting a static list of options (e.g. a list of buttons or a
  select field) the options can be defined in the localization Yaml file.
