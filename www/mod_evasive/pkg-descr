mod_dosevasive is an evasive maneuvers module for Apache to provide evasive
action in the event of an HTTP DoS or DDoS attack or brute force attack.  It is
also designed to be a detection and network management tool, and can be easily
configured to talk to ipchains, firewalls, routers, and etcetera.
mod_dosevasive presently reports abuses via email and syslog facilities.
