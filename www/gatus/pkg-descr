Gatus is a developer-oriented health dashboard that gives you the
ability to monitor your services using HTTP, ICMP, TCP, and even
DNS queries as well as evaluate the result of said queries by using
a list of conditions on values like the status code, the response
time, the certificate expiration, the body and many others. The
icing on top is that each of these health checks can be paired with
alerting via Slack, Teams, PagerDuty, Discord, Twilio and many more.
