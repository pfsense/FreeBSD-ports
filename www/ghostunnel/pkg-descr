Ghostunnel is a simple TLS proxy with mutual authentication support for securing
non-TLS backend applications.

Ghostunnel supports two modes, client mode and server mode. Ghostunnel in server
mode runs in front of a backend server and accepts TLS-secured connections,
which are then proxied to the (insecure) backend. A backend can be a TCP
domain/port or a UNIX domain socket. Ghostunnel in client mode accepts
(insecure) connections through a TCP or UNIX domain socket and proxies them to
a TLS-secured service. In other words, ghostunnel is a replacement for stunnel.
