Glance is a fast, lightweight dashboard that can display all manner of
widgets, including RSS feeds, stocks, Reddit and Hacker News and Twitch
feeds, bookmarks, system information, and more.

It's configurable through a single straightforward YAML file, and is
easily themeable (see /usr/local/share/doc/glance/themes.md), including
Catppuccin Mocha which objectively everyone should be using anyway.
Widgets can be cached, so pages load nearly instantly.
