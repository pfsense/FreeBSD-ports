This port sets up apt-cacher-ng to be used in a FreeBSD context.

The FreeBSD installer on the official media does not allow to provide the name of a proxy server.
When asked for a mirror to use, prepend the offered URL with the url of the proxy.
E.g. http://myproxy:3142/ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/amd64/10.3-RELEASE

PKGNG can be bootstrapped by setting the http_proxy environment
setenv http_proxy http://myproxy:3142
pkg bootstrap

proxy settings for pkgng can be persisted by editing /usr/local/etc/pkg.conf and adding
pkg_env: {
        http_proxy: "http://myproxy:3142",
}
