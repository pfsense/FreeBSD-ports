Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit that makes it easy to
build Web APIs.

Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:

* The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.

* Authentication policies including optional packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.

* Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.

* Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you
  don't need the more powerful features.

* Extensive documentation, and great community support.
