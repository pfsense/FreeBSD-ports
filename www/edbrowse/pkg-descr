Edbrowse is an editor, a web browser, and a mail client that is 100%
text based. The interface is similar to /bin/ed, though there are many
more features, such as editing multiple files simultaneously, and
rendering html.

This program was originally written for blind users, but many sighted
users have taken advantage of its unique scripting capabilities, which
can be found nowhere else. A batch job, or cron job, can access web
pages on the internet, submit forms, and send email, with no human
intervention whatsoever.
