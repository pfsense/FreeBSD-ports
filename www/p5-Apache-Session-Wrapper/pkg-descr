This module is a simple wrapper around Apache::Session which provides some
methods to simplify getting and setting the session id.

It can uses cookies to store the session id, or it can look in a provided
object for a specific parameter. Alternately, you can simply provide the
session id yourself in the call to the session() method.

If you're using Mason, you should probably take a look at
MasonX::Request::WithApacheSession first, which integrates this module directly
into Mason.
