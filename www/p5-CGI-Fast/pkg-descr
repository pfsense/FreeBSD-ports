CGI::Fast is a subclass of the CGI object created by CGI.pm. It is specialized
to work with the FCGI module, which greatly speeds up CGI scripts by turning
them into persistently running server processes. Scripts that perform
time-consuming initialization processes, such as loading large modules or
opening persistent database connections, will see large performance
improvements.
