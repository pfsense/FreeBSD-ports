This is an unofficial API for plurk.com. It uses the same interfaces that
plurk itself uses internally which are not published and not necessarily
stable. When Plurk publish a stable API this module will be updated to take
advantage of it. In the mean time use with caution.

Ryan Lim did the heavy lifting of reverse engineering the API. His PHP
implementation can be found at http://code.google.com/p/rlplurkapi/.
