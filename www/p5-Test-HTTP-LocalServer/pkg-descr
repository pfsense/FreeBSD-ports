Test::HTTP::LocalServer implements a tiny web server suitable for running "live"
tests of HTTP clients against it. It also takes care of cleaning %ENV from
settings that influence the use of a local proxy etc.

Use this web server if you write an HTTP client and want to exercise its
behaviour in your test suite without talking to the outside world.
