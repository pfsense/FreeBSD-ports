This module adds the following methods to HTTP::Response objects.

$res->charset

  Tells the charset exactly as appears in the Content-Type: header. Note that
  the presence of the charset does not guarantee if the response content is
  decodable via Encode.

$res->encoder

  Returns the corresponding encoder object or undef if it can't.

$res->encoding

  Tells the content encoding in the canonical name in Encode. Returns undef
  if it can't.

$res->decoded_content

  Discontinued since HTTP::Message already has this method.
