MimeTeX, licensed under the GPL, lets you easily embed LaTeX math in
your html pages.  It parses a LaTeX math expression and immediately
emits the corresponding gif image, rather than the usual TeX dvi.
And mimeTeX is an entirely separate little program that doesn't
use TeX or its fonts in any way.  It's just one cgi that you put in
your site's cgi-bin/ directory, with no other dependencies.
It's easy to use. Just place an html <img> tag in your document
wherever you want to see the corresponding LaTeX expression.
