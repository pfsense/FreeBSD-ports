CGI::Response is a Perl5 module for constructing responses to
 Common Gateway Interface (CGI) requests. It is designed to be
 light-weight and efficient for the most common tasks, and also
 to provide access to all HTTP response features for more
 advanced CGI applications.

There are two ways to use CGI::Response.
For basic applications, the Simple Interface provides a number
 of plain functions that cover the most commonly-used CGI
 response headers.
More advanced applications may employ the Full Interface object
 methods to access any HTTP header, or to add experimental or
 non-standard headers. Both interfaces try to generate reasonable
 defaults whenever possible.
