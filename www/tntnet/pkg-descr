Tntnet is a modular, multithreaded, high performance webapplicationserver
for C++. To create webapplications Tntnet has a template-language called
ecpp similar to php, jsp or mason, where you can embed c++-code inside a
html-page to generate active content. The ecpp-files are precompiled to
c++-classes called components and compiled and linked into a shared
library. This process is done at compiletime.
