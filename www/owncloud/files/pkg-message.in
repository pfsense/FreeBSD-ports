  message: <<EOM
Please note that everything has been installed in %%WWWDIR%%.

You will probably want to add an alias to your httpd.conf file, something
like this:

    	Alias /owncloud %%WWWDIR%%
	AcceptPathInfo On
	<Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
	    AllowOverride All
	    Require all granted
	</Directory>

And restart Apache.


The owncloud newsyslog.conf(5) filename has been changed:
  OLD: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/owncloud
  NEW: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/owncloud.conf

Any file found at the old location has been automatically moved to
the new location. This was done to ensure log rotation continued to
work after change r340318 made to FreeBSD base, where the default
newsyslog configuration now only includes filenames that end with
'.conf' and do not begin with '.'.

If you use provisioning/configuration management tools to create or
edit this file, you will need to change their configuration to use
the new filename.
