The Baculum API is a web application that is used to work with the Baculum Web.
It provides an interface, which serves data for Baculum Web.
The Baculum API is also capable to take actions with Bconsole, the Bacula configuration and the Bacula components.

There is possible to use the Baculum API separately (without Baculum Web) as a Bacula programming interface but using Baculum Web without Baculum API is not possible.
