A simple CLI utility for importing or exporting dashboard JSON definitions
using the Grafana HTTP API.

This may be useful for:

- Backing up your dashboards that already exist within your Grafana instance,
  e.g., if you are migrating from the internal sqlite database to MySQL.
- Updating dashboard files for your Infrastructure-as-Code, for use with
  Grafana dashboard provisioning.
- Making tweaks to dashboard JSON files directly and updating Grafana with one
  command.

Notable features:

- Mirrors the folder structure between a local set of dashboards and Grafana,
  creating folders where necessary.
- Ensures links to dashboards folders in a dashlist Panel are consistent with
  the Folder IDs - useful for deploying one set of dashboards across mulitple
  Grafana instances, e.g., for dev, test, prod environments.
