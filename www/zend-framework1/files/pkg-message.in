Now you need to adjust PHP's include_path to contain
	`%%DATADIR%%/library'

For example, insert:
        include_path = ".:%%DATADIR%%/library"

into `%%LOCALBASE%%/etc/php.ini'.

Zend Framework includes the Zend_Tool class and wrapper script
for automating many common framework-related tasks. To use the
zf wrapper script, set the following environment variable:

Bourne shell:
    export ZEND_TOOL_INCLUDE_PATH_PREPEND= \
        %%DATADIR%%/library

C-shell:
    setenv ZEND_TOOL_INCLUDE_PATH_PREPEND \
        %%DATADIR%%/library

Documentation for the Zend_Tool class is found at:
http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.tool.framework.introduction.html
