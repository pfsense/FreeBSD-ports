 To display images in proper positions,
 you should set font size of your terminal emulator to
 "# of pixels per character" and "# of pixels per line"
 in Option Setting Panel.

 For example, if you use 14 pixel fonts, the values
 should be these.

 # of pixels per character = 7
 # of pixels per line = 14
