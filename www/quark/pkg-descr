Extremely small and simple HTTP GET/HEAD-only web server for static content.
The goal of this project is to do one thing and do it well, namely serving
static web directories and doing that right. Most other solutions either are too
complex (CGI support, dependencies on external libraries, ...) or lack features
you expect (TLS, virtual hosts, partial content, not modified since, ...). quark
tries to find a midway and just restrict itself to being static while still
offering functions you only find in more bloated solutions and being as secure
as possible (chroot, privilege dropping, strict parsers, no malloc at runtime,
pledge, unveil, ...).
