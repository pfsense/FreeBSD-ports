xcaddy is a tool to build custom Caddy web servers with plugins.

SECURITY NOTICE:
When building and running Caddy servers created with xcaddy, it is strongly
recommended to run the resulting Caddy binary as an unprivileged user, such as
www:www, rather than as root.

For secure deployment of Caddy servers built with xcaddy:

- Use security/portacl-rc to enable privileged port binding:

  # pkg install security/portacl-rc
  # sysrc portacl_users+=www
  # sysrc portacl_user_www_tcp="http https"
  # sysrc portacl_user_www_udp="https"
  # service portacl enable
  # service portacl start

- Run your custom Caddy binary as www:www instead of root

See https://caddyserver.com/docs/ for Caddy configuration documentation.
See https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy for xcaddy usage instructions.
