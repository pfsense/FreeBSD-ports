Tiny Tiny RSS is now installed, but it requires some additional setup.

You now need to create a database, a database user, configure the
web server, and configure tt-rss.  Sample apache24 configs located
at %%DATADIR%%/httpd-tt-rss.conf.

Configure tt-rss (https://tt-rss.org/wiki/GlobalConfig) :
    %%WWWDIR%%/config.php

If your database is on another server:
    # sysrc ttrssd_local_db=NO

Enable the ttrssd daemon:
    # sysrc ttrssd_enable=YES
    # service ttrssd start

Goto config.php's TTRSS_SELF_URL_PATH in a web browser.
Default user is "admin", with the password "password".

After an upgrade, you might need to update your database schema.
Perform one of the following:
- Login as an admin user via the web ui, tt-rss will ask you to update.
- Restart the ttrssd service and view /var/log/ttrssd.log for shema updates.
- Temporally enable SINGLE_USER_MODE in config.php and open web ui.
