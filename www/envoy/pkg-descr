Originally built at Lyft, Envoy is a high performance C++ distributed proxy
designed for single services and applications, as well as a communication
bus and "universal data plane" designed for large microservice "service
mesh" architectures.  Built on the learnings of solutions such as NGINX,
HAProxy, hardware load balancers, and cloud load balancers, Envoy runs
alongside every application and abstracts the network by providing common
features in a platform-agnostic manner.  When all service traffic in an
infrastructure flows via an Envoy mesh, it becomes easy to visualize problem
areas via consistent observability, tune overall performance, and add
substrate features in a single place.
