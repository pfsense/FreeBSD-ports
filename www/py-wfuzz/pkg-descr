Wfuzz has been created to facilitate the task in web applications assessments
and it is based on a simple concept: it replaces any reference to the FUZZ
keyword by the value of a given payload.

Wfuzz is more than a web content scanner:
* Wfuzz could help you to secure your web applications by finding and exploiting
  web application vulnerabilities. Wfuzz's web application vulnerability scanner
  is supported by plugins.

* Wfuzz is a completely modular framework and makes it easy for even the newest
  of Python developers to contribute. Building plugins is simple and takes
  little more than a few minutes.

* Wfuzz exposes a simple language interface to the previous HTTP
  requests/responses performed using Wfuzz or other tools, such as Burp. This
  allows you to perform manual and semi-automatic tests with full context and
  understanding of your actions, without relying on a web application scanner
  underlying implementation.

It was created to facilitate the task in web applications assessment. It is a
tool by pentesters for pentesters.
