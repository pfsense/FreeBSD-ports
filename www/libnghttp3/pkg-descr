nghttp3 is an implementation of HTTP/3 mapping over QUIC and QPACK in C. It does
not depend on any particular QUIC transport implementation.

The HTTP/3 library implements HTTP/3 draft-24. It can exchange basic HTTP
request, response and server push, but does not fully implement the
specification at the moment.

The QPACK library implements QPACK draft-11. It supports dynamic table.
