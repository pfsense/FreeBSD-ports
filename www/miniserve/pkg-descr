Miniserve is a small self-contained ad-hoc HTTP server that allows
you to quickly serve some files over HTTP.

Features:
- Easy to use
- Just works: Correct MIME types handling out of the box
- Single binary drop-in with no extra dependencies required
- Authentication support with username and password
- Fast and highly parallel (thanks to Rust and Actix)

It is an interesting alternative to some popular solutions:
- Python's built-in webserver: Needs to have Python installed, is
  low performance, and also does not handle MIME type correctly in
  some cases.
- netcat: Not as convenient to use and sending directories is
  nontrivial.
