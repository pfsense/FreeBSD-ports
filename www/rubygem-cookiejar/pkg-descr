The Ruby CookieJar is a library to help manage client-side cookies
in pure Ruby. It enables parsing and setting of cookie headers,
alternating between multiple 'jars' of cookies at one time (such
as having a set of cookies for each browser or thread), and supports
persistence of the cookies in a JSON string.

Both Netscape/RFC 2109 cookies and RFC 2965 cookies are supported.
