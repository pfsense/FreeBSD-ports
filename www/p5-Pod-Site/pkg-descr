Pod::Site searches a list of directories and generates a jQuery-powered
documentation site from all of the POD files it finds. It was originally
designed for the Bricolage project but is has evolved for general use.
Have a look at the Bricolage API Browser to see a sample documentation
site in action. The generated documentation site supports Safari, Firefox,
and IE7 and up.
