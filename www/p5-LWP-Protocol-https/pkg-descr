The LWP::Protocol::https module provide support for using https schemed URLs
with LWP. This module is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so you don't
use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access sites using
HTTP over SSL/TLS.

If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and neither
SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be the one
provided by Mozilla::CA. If the Mozilla::CA module isn't available SSL requests
will fail. Either install this module, set up an alternative SSL_ca_file or
disable hostname verification.

This module used to be bundled with the libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
tool-chain. Applications that need https support can just declare their
dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
underlying modules to install.
