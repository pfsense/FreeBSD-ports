This module allows a Class::AlzaboWrapper::Cursor object to be used as
a TT2 iterator.

For a cursor which returns one object at a time, the iterator simply
returns one object per iteration. When the cursor returns multiple
objects, the iterator returns a hash reference where the keys are the
table name of the object's class in lower-case, with camel-casing
turned into underscores. The values of the hash are the objects.

So if the cursor returns Foo::User and Foo::Page objects, the keys are
"user" and "page".
