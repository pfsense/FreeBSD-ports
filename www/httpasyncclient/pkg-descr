Asynch HttpClient is a HTTP/1.1 compliant HTTP agent implementation based
on HttpCore NIO and HttpClient components. It is a complementary module
to Apache HttpClient intended for special cases where ability to handle a
great number of concurrent connections is more important than performance
in terms of a raw data throughput.
