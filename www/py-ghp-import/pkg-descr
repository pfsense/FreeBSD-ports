GitHub Pages is a pretty awesome service that GitHub provides for hosting
project documentation. The only thing is that it requires a gh-pages branch that
is the site's document root. This means that keeping documentation sources in
the branch with code is a bit difficult. And it really turns into a head
scratcher for things like Sphinx that want to access documentation sources and
code sources at the same time.

Then I stumbled across an interesting looking package called github-tools that
looked almost like what I wanted. It was a tad complicated and more involved
than I wanted but it gave me an idea. Why not just write a script that can copy
a directory to the gh-pages branch of the repository. This saves me from even
having to think about the branch and everything becomes magical.

This is what ghp-import was written for.
