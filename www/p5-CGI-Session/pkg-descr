    "CGI::Session" is Perl5 library that provides an easy persistent session
    management system across HTTP requests. Session persistence is a very
    important issue in web applications. Shopping carts, user-recognition
    features, login and authentication methods and etc. all require
    persistent session management mechanism, which is both secure and
    reliable. "CGI::Session" provides with just that. You can read the whole
    documentation as a tutorial on session management. But if you are
    already familiar with "CGI::Session" go to the methods section for the
    list of all the methods available.
