1) Create a user and a empty database for Matomo to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).

2) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   ### Add the AcceptPathInfo directive only for Apache 2.4.30 or later.
   Alias /matomo %%WWWDIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
      # Apache 2.4 no longer accepts "Order" or "Allow from ..."
      Require all granted
   </Directory>

3) Visit your Matomo site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/matomo/), and you should
   be taken to the setup script, which will lead
   you through setting up Matomo.
