DokuWiki is a standards compliant, simple to use Wiki, mainly aimed at
creating documentation of any kind. It is targeted at developer teams,
workgroups and small companies. It has a simple but powerful syntax which
makes sure the datafiles remain readable outside the Wiki and eases the
creation of structured texts.
All data is stored in plain text files - no database is required.
