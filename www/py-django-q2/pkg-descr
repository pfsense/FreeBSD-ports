A multiprocessing distributed task queue for Django

Django Q2 is a fork of Django Q. Big thanks to Ilan Steemers for starting this
project. Unfortunately, development has stalled since June 2021. Django Q2 is
the new updated version of Django Q, with dependencies updates, docs updates and
several bug fixes.
