This class is the parent for all access method supported by the WWW::Search
library.  This library implements a Perl API to web-based search engines.

Current search engines supported include AltaVista (both web and news),
Dejanews, Excite (web only), HotBot (web only), Infoseek (e-mail, web, and news)
and Lycos.

Search results are limited and there is a pause between each request for results
to avoid overloading either the client or the server.
