Perform common useful JavaScript operations in Shiny apps that will greatly
improve your apps without having to know any JavaScript. Examples include:
hiding an element, disabling an input, resetting an input back to its original
value, delaying code execution by a few seconds, and many more useful functions
for both the end user and the developer. 'shinyjs' can also be used to easily
call your own custom JavaScript functions from R.
