aiohttp-middlewares is a collection of useful middlewares for aiohttp.web
applications.

By default aiohttp.web does not provide many built-in middlewares for standart
web-development needs such as: handling errors, shielding view handlers, or
providing CORS headers.

aiohttp-middlewares tries to fix this by providing several middlewares that aims
to cover most common web-development needs.
