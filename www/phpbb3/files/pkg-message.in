  message: <<EOM
phpBB3 has been installed, but is not quite ready to be used yet!

You have to ensure that you have a database server (or ODBC access to a
remote database) installed and configured, and you have to ensure that your
PHP installation has been compiled with support for your database or
database access method.  You have to create a database for phpBB3 to use,
and ensure that this database may be accessed and changed by the user id
under which your web server executes.  If you chose to install the
documentation, further information may be found in:

  %%DOCSDIR%%/README.html

Once these steps have been taken, you may connect to the following URL to
configure your installation of phpBB3:

  http://localhost/%%PHPBBURL%%/

After configuring phpBB3 and ensuring that it is operational, you MUST
remove or rename the install/ directory from %%PREFIX%%/%%PHPBBDIR%%.
