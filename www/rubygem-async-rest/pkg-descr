Roy Thomas Fielding's thesis Architectural Styles and the Design of
Network-based Software Architectures describes Representational State Transfer
which comprises several core concepts:
- Resource: A conceptual mapping to one or more entities.
- Representation: An instance of a resource at a given point in time.

Async::REST models these abstractions as closely and practically as possible and
serves as a basis for building asynchronous web clients.
