The websh _executable_ is deliberately not installed by this port.
To load websh functionality into regular Tcl-scripts, simply use:

	package require websh


For a ready to use example on configuring the module, see:

	%%EXAMPLESDIR%%/httpd.conf

The file can be simply copied into the

	%%PREFIX%%/%%APACHEETCDIR%%/Includes/

under more recent Apache versions.

Be sure to create %%PREFIX%%/etc/websh.conf -- most likely, you'll
simply copy the installed %%PREFIX%%/etc/websh.conf.dist over.
