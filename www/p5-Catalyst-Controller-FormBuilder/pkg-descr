This base controller merges the functionality of CGI::FormBuilder with
Catalyst and the following templating systems: Template Toolkit, Mason and
HTML::Template. This gives you access to all of FormBuilder's niceties,
such as controllablefield stickiness, multilingual support, and Javascript
generation. For more details, see CGI::FormBuilder or the website at:
