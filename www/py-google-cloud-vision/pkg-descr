The Google Cloud Vision API enables developers to understand the content of an
image by encapsulating powerful machine learning models in an easy to use REST
API. It quickly classifies images into thousands of categories (e.g.,
"sailboat", "lion", "Eiffel Tower"), detects individual objects and faces within
images, and finds and reads printed words contained within images. You can build
metadata on your image catalog, moderate offensive content, or enable new
marketing scenarios through image sentiment analysis. Analyze images uploaded in
the request or integrate with your image storage on Google Cloud Storage.
