Rate limiting is for servers, rate throttling is for clients. This library
implements a number of strategies for handling rate throttling on the client and
a methodology for comparing performance of those clients. We don't just give you
the code to rate throttle, we also give you the information to help you figure
out the best strategy to rate throttle as well.
