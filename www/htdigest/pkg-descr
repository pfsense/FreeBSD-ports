The htdigest utility from Apache is useful for other web servers too--
lighttpd for example can make use of the digests thus created.

This package contains just htdigest, renamed as apache-htdigest to avoid
conflicts.  It means that the htdigest utility is available without installing
the entire Apache distribution.
