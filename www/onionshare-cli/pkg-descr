OnionShare (CLI) lets you securely and anonymously send and receive files.

It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor onion service,
and generating an unguessable web address so others can download files
from you, or upload files to you.

It does *NOT* require setting up a separate server or using a third party
file-sharing service.
