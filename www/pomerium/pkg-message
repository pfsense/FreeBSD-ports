## Quick start

You need a configured indentity provider and a wild-card TLS certificate
before proceeding (if Pomerium will be terminating TLS connections).
Please note that the default installation runs Pomerium with unprivileged
"www" user, and therefore will not be able to bind on 443 unless
net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedhigh is lowered.

Please consult the official website https://www.pomerium.io/docs/ for
additional configuration information.
