Pomerium is an identity-aware proxy that enables secure access to internal
applications. Pomerium provides a standardized interface to add access
control to applications regardless of whether the application itself has
authorization or authentication baked-in. Pomerium gateways both internal
and external requests, and can be used in situations where you'd typically
reach for a VPN.

Pomerium can be used to:

 - provide a single-sign-on gateway to internal applications.
 - enforce dynamic access policy based on context, identity, and device state.
 - aggregate access logs and telemetry data.
 - a VPN alternative.
