   its tables in (or choose an existing database).

2) Add the following to your Apache configuration file
   httpd.conf, and restart the server:

   Alias /opencart %%WWWDIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Require all granted
   </Directory>

3) Visit your opencart site with a browser (i.e.,
