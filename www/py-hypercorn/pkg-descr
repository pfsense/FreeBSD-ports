Hypercorn is an ASGI web server based on the sans-io hyper, h11, h2, and wsproto
libraries and inspired by Gunicorn. Hypercorn supports HTTP/1, HTTP/2,
WebSockets (over HTTP/1 and HTTP/2), ASGI/2, and ASGI/3 specifications.
Hypercorn can utilise asyncio, uvloop, or trio worker types.

Hypercorn can optionally serve the current draft of the HTTP/3 specification
using the aioquic library.
