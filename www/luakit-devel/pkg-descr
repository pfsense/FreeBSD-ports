Luakit is a highly configurable browser framework based on the
WebKit web content engine and the GTK+ toolkit.

It is very fast, extensible with Lua, and licensed under the GNU
GPLv3 license. It is primarily targeted at power users, developers
and anyone who wants to have fine-grained control over their web
browser's behaviour and interface.
