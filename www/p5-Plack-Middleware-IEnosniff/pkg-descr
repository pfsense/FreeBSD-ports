Plack::Middleware::IEnosniff is middleware for Plack.  This middleware
adds HTTP Header 'X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff' for safe.  Sending
X-Content-Type-Options response header with the value nosniff will
prevent Internet Explorer from MIME-sniffing a response away from the
declared content-type.
