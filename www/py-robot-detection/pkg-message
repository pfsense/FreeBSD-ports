You can download a new version of the Robot Database from https://www.robotstxt.org/db/all.txt.

Download the database dump, and run the file robot_detection.py with the file as first argument.

	$ fetch https://www.robotstxt.org/db/all.txt
	$ python robot_detection.py all.txt

If the database has changed, it'll print out the new version of robot_useragents variable that you need to put into the source code.
