  To start Privoxy on boot, add: privoxy_enable="YES"
  to /etc/rc.conf.

  To start Privoxy manually, run:
  service privoxy forcestart

  The rc script understands most of the commands listed
  in rc(8), it also contains a list of other rc variables
  you can use.

  Privoxy's example files were copied to:
  %%EXAMPLESDIR%%

  For documentation see:
  %%DOCSDIR%%/user-manual or 'man privoxy'

  Note that default.filter and default.action get
  overwritten with each Privoxy update. Instead of
  changing them you should use your own action and
  filter files as described in Privoxy's manual.
