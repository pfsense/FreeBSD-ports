lynx is the oldest actively-maintained console-based web browser. It
is highly configurable and can act as a front-end for a large number
of network services.

Although lynx is fast, small, and very stable, it makes no attempt
to handle JavaScript or CSS formatting. Other console browsers like
elinks (www/elinks) tackle those languages, with varying degrees
of success.
