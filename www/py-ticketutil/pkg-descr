ticketutil is a Python module that allows you to easily interact with various
ticketing tools using their REST APIs. Currently, the supported tools are JIRA,
RT, Redmine, Bugzilla, and ServiceNow. All tools support HTTP Basic
authentication, while JIRA and RT also support Kerberos authentication.
Additionally, Bugzilla supports API key authentication and Jira supports
Personal Access Token authentication.

This module allows you to create tickets, add comments, edit ticket fields, and
change the status of tickets in each tool. Additional lower-level tool-specific
functions are supported - adding and removing watchers in JIRA, adding
attachments in JIRA, etc.
