Feersum is an HTTP server built on EV. It fully supports the PSGI 1.03 spec
including the psgi.streaming interface and is compatible with Plack. PSGI 1.1,
which has yet to be published formally, is also supported. Feersum also has
its own "native" interface which is similar in a lot of ways to PSGI, but is
not compatible with PSGI or PSGI middleware.

Feersum uses a single-threaded, event-based programming architecture to scale
and can handle many concurrent connections efficiently in both CPU and RAM.
It skips doing a lot of sanity checking with the assumption that a "front-end"
HTTP/HTTPS server is placed between it and the Internet.
