Test::HTTP is designed to make it easier to write tests which are mainly
about HTTP-level things, such as REST-type services.

Each Test::HTTP object can contain state about a current request and its
response.  This allows convenient shorthands for sending requests,
checking status codes, headers, and message bodies.
