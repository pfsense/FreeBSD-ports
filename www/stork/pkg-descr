Stork is a library for creating beautiful, fast, and accurate full-text search
interfaces on the web.

It comes in two parts. First, it's a command-line tool that indexes content and
creates a search index file that you can upload to a web server. Second, it's a
Javascript library that uses that index file to build an interactive search
interface that displays optimal search results immediately to your user, as they
type.

Stork is built with Rust, and the Javascript library uses WebAssembly behind the
scenes. It's easy to get started and is even easier to customize so it fits your
needs. It's perfect for Jamstack sites and personal blogs, but can be used
wherever you need an interactive search bar.
