Event and agent system, which allows you to create your own agents that perform
automated tasks triggered by events and filters.

It is modular, flexible and really easy to extend for anyone. It has modules
(we call them Hives), so it can interface with, talk to, or retrieve
information from Twitter, Tumblr, Email, IRC, Jabber, RSS, Jenkins, Hue - to
name just a few.
