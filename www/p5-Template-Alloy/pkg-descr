Template::Alloy represents the mixing of features and capabilities from all of
the major mini-language based template systems (support for non-mini-language
based systems will happen eventually). With Template::Alloy you can use your
favorite template interface and syntax and get features from each of the other
major template systems. And Template::Alloy is fast - whether your using
mod_perl, cgi, or running from the commandline. There is even
Template::Alloy::XS for getting a little more speed when that is necessary.
