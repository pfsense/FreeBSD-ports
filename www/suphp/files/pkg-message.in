SuPHP has no upstream maintainer and thus is not actively having
bugs and security issues addressed.

Its security track record is pretty good. The worst so far has been
privilege escalation to the httpd user, which is no worse than not
using SuPHP.

It is advisable to convert your system to PHP-FPM if possible.
