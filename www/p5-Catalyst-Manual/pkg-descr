This is just the Catalyst manual.  If you want to develop Catalyst
apps, please install Catalyst::Devel.  If you'd like a tutorial and a
full example Catalyst application, please intall
Task::Catalyst::Tutorial.

If you just want to run Catalyst applications, you probably don't need
this manual, but you do need Catalyst::Runtime.
