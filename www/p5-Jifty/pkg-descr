Jifty -- Just Do It.

Jifty is yet another web framework.  Jifty tries not to make you say
things more than once.  Out of the proverbial box, Jifty comes with one
way to do everything you should need to do: One database mapper, one
templating system, one web services layer, one AJAX toolkit, one set of
handlers for standalone or FastCGI servers. We work hard to make all the
bits play well together, so you don't have to.
