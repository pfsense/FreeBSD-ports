rfc3987-syntax provides helper functions to parse and validate the syntax of
terms defined in RFC 3987 -- the IETF standard for Internationalized Resource
Identifiers (IRIs).

The goal of rfc3987-syntax is to provide a lightweight, permissively licensed
Python module for validating that strings conform to the ABNF grammar defined in
RFC 3987. These helpers are:
- Strictly aligned with the syntax rules of RFC 3987
- Built using a permissive MIT license
- Designed for both open source and proprietary use
- Powered by Lark, a fast, EBNF-based parser
