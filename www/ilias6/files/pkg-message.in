1 Please keep in mind that
heavily used ILIAS installation can cause huge growth
of your log file, so remember to disable notices logging
in your PHP installation.

2 Also, this installation process has installed everything
that is needed for ILIAS to run properly with basic
functionality, but to broaden it you will have to install
third party software like Sun Java, HTMLdoc, LaTeX or
some virus scanner by yourself.

3 Add the following to your Apache configuration file
   httpd.conf, and restart the server:

   Alias /ilias %%WWWDIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%WWWDIR%%/>
      AllowOverride None
      Require all granted
   </Directory>

4 If you use MySQL, Strict SQL Mode MUST be disabled.

5 After installation, you should use 'composer install'
in the directory %%WWWDIR%%/libs/composer.

6 Then feel free to proceed to ILIAS web setup proccess.
  When input Ilias data directory, please use
  %%PREFIX%%/%%ILIASDATADIR%% and uncheck the create option.

7 If all is OK, you can login into the system with
username/root and password/homer as the administrator.
