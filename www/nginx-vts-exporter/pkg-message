  message: <<EOM
nginx-vts-exporter was successfully installed.

By default the exporter is passed no arguments and runs with its own defaults,
this means it expects to find Nginx VTS status at http://localhost/status.

You may wish to reconfigure this by setting:
nginx_vts_exporter_args="-nginx.scrape_uri http://nginx/status/url"
EOM
