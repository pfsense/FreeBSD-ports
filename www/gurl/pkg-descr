command-line cURL-like tool for humans, written in go. gURL can be used
for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with HTTP servers. It
makes using headers and JSON a delight.

A simple GET with custom header:
$ gurl httpbin.org/get x-header:custom

An automatic choice of POST, with content-type and JSON body:
$ gurl httpbin.org/post bool=true key=value

A PUT to HTTPS site from stdin:
$ gurl PUT https://httpbin.org/put < /etc/os-release
