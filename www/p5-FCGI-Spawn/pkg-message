For the first time, check all the docs supplied wwith the package.

To run the fcgi_spawn on boot time, create the system user for it, and group,
too. After that, assuming you name them "fcgi", add this to your rc.conf:

fcgi_spawn_enable="YES"
fcgi_spawn_username="fcgi"
fcgi_spawn_groupname="fcgi"

You may want to set fcgi_spawn_flags also according to taste.
