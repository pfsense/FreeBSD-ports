  message: <<EOM
You installed restbed, the framework to build RESTful applications
in C++11.

Currently restbed has the caveat that it only works correctly on
FreeBSD with this sysctl variable value: net.inet6.ip6.v6only=0.
This value is not the default.

When net.inet6.ip6.v6only=1, tests don't pass, and applications using
this library can fail.

See https://github.com/Corvusoft/restbed/issues/231 for further
information.
