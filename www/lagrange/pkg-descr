Lagrange is a desktop GUI client for browsing
Geminispace. It offers modern conveniences
familiar from web browsers, such as smooth
scrolling, inline image viewing, multiple tabs,
visual themes, Unicode fonts, bookmarks,
history, and page outlines.

Like Gemini, Lagrange has been designed with
minimalism in mind. It depends on a small
number of essential libraries. It is written
in C and uses SDL for hardware-accelerated
graphics. OpenSSL is used for secure
communications.
