The module contains some code generators for Prototype, the famous
JavaScript OO library and the script.aculous extensions.

The Prototype library (http://prototype.conio.net/) is designed to make
AJAX easy. Catalyst::Plugin::Prototype makes it easy to connect to the
Prototype library.

This is mostly a port of the Ruby on Rails helper tags for JavaScript
for use in Catalyst.
