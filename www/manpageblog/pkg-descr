manpageblog is a small, lightweight blog engine written in Python and
offers several advantages. Firstly, it provides simplicity and ease
of use, making it accessible even for users with limited technical
knowledge. The lightweight nature ensures quick installation and minimal
resource consumption, making it suitable for various hosting environments.
No database is needed at all.

The blog engine is highly customizable, see the examples director for a
complete set of configuration and template files and some sample content..

After installation, you can create a "blog.conf" file based on the one
in the examples directory of this port with "base_path" adjusted to the
document root of your blog and then start a simple HTTP server using the
command "manpageblog -m http.server". The server URL can be changed in
"blog.conf", too. The default value is: "http://localhost:8000".
