Zola is your one-stop static site engine.  It comes as a single
executable with Sass compilation, syntax highlighting, table of
contents, and many other features that traditionally require setting
up a dev environment or adding some JavaScript libraries to your
site.

The average site will be generated in less than a second, including
Sass compilation and syntax highlighting.

Zola renders your whole site as static files, making it trivial to
handle any kind of traffic you will throw at it at no cost without
having to worry about managing a server or a database.

Zola supports augmented Markdown which comes with shortcodes and
internal links to make it easier to write your content.
