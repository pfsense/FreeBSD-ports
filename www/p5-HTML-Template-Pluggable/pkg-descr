Just use this module instead of HTML::Template, then use any plugins, and go on
with life.

By adding support for the module included, HTML::Template::Plugin::Dot, to
HTML::Template, the programmers' job of sending data to the template is easier,
and designers have easier access to more data to display in the template,
without learning any more tag syntax.
