CGI::Framework is a simple and lightweight framework for building web-based CGI
applications. It features complete code-content separation (templating) by
utilizing the HTML::Template library, stateful file or database-based sessions
by utilizing the CGI::Session library, form parsing by utilizing the CGI
library, (optional) multi-lingual templates support, and an extremely easy to
use methodology for the validation, pre-preparation and post-cleanup associated
with each template. It also provides easy logging mechanisms, graceful fatal
error handling, including special templates and emails to admins.
