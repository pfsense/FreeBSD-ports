This is a parser for HTTP messages written in C.  It parses both requests
and responses.  The parser is designed to be used in performance HTTP
applications.  It does not make any system calls nor allocations, it does
not buffer data, it can be interrupted at anytime.  Depending on the
architecture, it only requires about 40 bytes of data per message stream
(in a web server that is per connection).
