AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After you
set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side
software for that. With the rise of Internet-Of-Things and connected devices, it
becomes more and more important to be able to control your whole network.
