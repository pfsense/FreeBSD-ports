The Servlet API

Java Servlet technology provides Web developers with a simple, consistent
mechanism for extending the functionality of a Web server and for accessing
existing business systems. A servlet can almost be thought of as an applet that
runs on the server side -- without a face. Java servlets make many Web
applications possible.
