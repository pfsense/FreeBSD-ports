Apache2::SiteControl is a set of perl object-oriented classes that implement
a fine-grained security control system for a web-based application.  The
intent is to provide a clear, easy-to-integrate system that does not require
the policies to be written into your application components.  It attempts to
separate the concerns of how to show and manipulate data from the concerns
of who is allowed to view and manipulate data and why.
