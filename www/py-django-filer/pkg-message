Add "filer" and related apps to your INSTALLED_APPS setting and run
manage.py migrate:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'easy_thumbnails',
    'filer',
    'mptt',
    ...
]

Note that easy_thumbnails also has database tables and needs a
manage.py migrate.

For easy_thumbnails to support retina displays (recent MacBooks, iOS) add to
settings.py:

THUMBNAIL_HIGH_RESOLUTION = True

If you forget this, you may not see thumbnails for your uploaded files. Adding
this line and refreshing the admin page will create the missing thumbnails.
