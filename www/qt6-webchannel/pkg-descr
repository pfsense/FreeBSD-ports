Qt WebChannel enables peer-to-peer communication between a server (QML/C++
application) and a client (HTML/JavaScript or QML application). It is supported
out of the box by Qt WebEngine. In addition, it can work on all browsers that
support WebSockets, enabling Qt WebChannel clients to run in any JavaScript
environment (including QML). This requires implementing a custom transport
based on Qt WebSockets.

The module provides a JavaScript library for seamless integration of C++ and
QML applications with HTML/JavaScript and QML clients. The clients must use the
JavaScript library to access the serialized QObjects published by the host
applications.
