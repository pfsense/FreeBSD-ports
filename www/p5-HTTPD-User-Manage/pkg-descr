HTTPD-User-Manage is set of Perl modules for managing access control
with the Apache, NCSA httpd, CERN and Netscape servers (and maybe some
others).

You can install this program as a CGI script to allow remote users to
change their Web access passwords.  Web administrators can use it to
remotely add, edit and delete users and their groups.  You can also use
it from the command line as a nice all-in-one interface to access
control databases based on text files, DBM files, and SQL databases.
