Logswan is a fast Web log analyzer using probabilistic data structures. It is
targeted at very large log files, typically APIs logs. It has constant memory
usage regardless of the log file size, and takes approximatively 4MB of RAM.

Project design goals include: speed, memory-usage efficiency, and keeping
the code as simple as possible.
