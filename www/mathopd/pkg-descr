Mathopd is a very small, yet very fast HTTP server for UN*X systems.

Mathopd is designed specifically to handle a large number of connections
with minimal fuss. It contains no unnecessary add-ons, but it does the
trick for most things.

Mathopd does not allocate any memory, once it has started up, and
does not fork any processes (except for CGI scripts of course.)
