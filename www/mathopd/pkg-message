Before you start the server you must create a config file.
The easiest way to do it is to copy /usr/local/etc/mathopd.conf.sample
to /usr/local/etc/mathopd.conf and edit this file to your taste.

After you've done with that, chmod 540 /usr/local/etc/rc.d/mathopd.sh
and run it.

Also do not forget to create your web hierarchy and to set its
permissions to something secure.
