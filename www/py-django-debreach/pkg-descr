Basic/extra mitigation against the BREACH attack for Django projects.

django-debreach provides additional protection to Django's built in CSRF token
masking by randomizing the content length of each response.

This is achieved by adding a random string of between 12 and 25 characters as a
comment to the end of the HTML content.  Note that this will only be applied to
responses with a content type of text/html.
