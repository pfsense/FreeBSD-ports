Let's suppose you want to find the title of things on the web. This
seems like a really simple request, just get() the object, parse for a
title tag, you're done. There are several problems with this approach:

- What if the resource is on a very slow server? Do we wait for ever or
  what?

- What if the resource is a 900 gig file? You don't want to download
  that.

- What if the page title isn't in a title tag, but is buried in the HTML
  somewhere?

- What if the resource is an MP3 file, or a word document or something?

This module attempts to solve this problem.
