This simple Django utility allows you to utilize the 12factor inspired
DATABASE_URL environment variable to configure your Django application.

The dj_database_url.config method returns a Django database connection
dictionary, populated with all the data specified in your URL.  There is
also a conn_max_age argument to easily enable Django's connection pool.

If you'd rather not use an environment variable, you can pass a URL in
directly instead to dj_database_url.parse.

Supported Databases:

Support currently exists for PostgreSQL, PostGIS, MySQL, MySQL (GIS),
Oracle, Oracle (GIS), and SQLite.
