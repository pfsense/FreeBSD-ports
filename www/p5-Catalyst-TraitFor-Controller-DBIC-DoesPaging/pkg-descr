Catalyst::TraitFor::Controller::DBIC::DoesPaging - Helps you paginate,
search, sort, and more easily using DBIx::Class.

This module helps you to map various DBIx::Class features to CGI
parameters. For the most part that means it will help you search,
sort, and paginate with a minimum of effort and thought.
