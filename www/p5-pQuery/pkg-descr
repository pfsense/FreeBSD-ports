pQuery is a pragmatic attempt to port the jQuery JavaScript framework to
Perl. It is pragmatic in the sense that it switches certain JavaScript
idioms for Perl ones, in order to make the use of it concise. A primary
goal of jQuery is to "Find things and do things, concisely". pQuery has
the same goal.
