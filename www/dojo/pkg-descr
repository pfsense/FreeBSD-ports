Dojo is an Open Source DHTML toolkit written in JavaScript. It
builds on several contributed code bases (nWidgets, Burstlib, f(m)),
which is why we refer to it sometimes as a "unified" toolkit. Dojo
aims to solve some long-standing historical problems with DHTML
which prevented mass adoption of dynamic web application development.
