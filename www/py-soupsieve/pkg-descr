SoupSieve is a CSS selector library designed to be used with
BeautifulSoup4. It aims to provide selecting, matching, and
filtering using modern CSS selectors. SoupSieve currently
provides selectors from the CSS level 1 specifications up
through the latest CSS level 4 drafts (though some are not yet
implemented).
