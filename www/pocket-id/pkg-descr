Pocket ID is a simple OIDC provider that allows users to authenticate
with their passkeys to your services.

The goal of Pocket ID is to be a simple and easy-to-use. There are
other self-hosted OIDC providers like Keycloak or ORY Hydra but
they are often too complex for simple use cases.

Additionally, what makes Pocket ID special is that it only supports
passkey authentication, which means you don't need a password. Some
people might not like this idea at first, but I believe passkeys
are the future, and once you try them, you'll love them. For example,
you can now use a physical Yubikey to sign in to all your self-hosted
services easily and securely
