  This is Threema Web, compiled with 'SELF_HOSTED=true' and with pre-defined
  STUN/TURN and SaltyRTC servers on its bundled configuration. If you want to run
  your own servers you must recompile this port yourself and make sure to define
  the following variables:

    THREEMA_ICE_CREDEN, the credentials for "threema-angular" (static username);
    THREEMA_ICE_SERVER, your STUN server in a "hostname:port" format; 
    THREEMA_SALTYRTC_HOST, your SaltyRTC server;
    THREEMA_SALTYRTC_PORT, the port of your SaltyRTC server,
    THREEMA_SALTYRTC_KEY, the key used by your SaltyRTC server.

  The web server needs to set the proper MIME type for *.wasm (WebAssembly) files.

  If you use nginx, this would go into nginx's mime types:

    application/wasm wasm;

  Should you opt for Apache, then you would need to add this to httpd.conf:

    AddType application/wasm .wasm

  Make sure to serve Threema Web only via HTTPS. It's also recommend to enable
  HSTS, HPKP, CSP and other available security mechanisms in your web server.

  If you deployed it to be used on a server with restrictive CSP rules, make sure
  to add "static.threema.ch" as an allowed style/font source.

  NOTE: While you could in theory host your own version of the "push-server",
        it won't help much since the GCM/APN API Keys required to dispatch push
        notifications to the Threema app are *NOT* public.
