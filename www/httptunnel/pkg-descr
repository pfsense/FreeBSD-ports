httptunnel creates a bidirectional virtual data path tunnelled
in HTTP requests. The requests can be sent via an HTTP proxy if
so desired. This can be useful for users behind restrictive
firewalls. If WWW access is allowed through an HTTP proxy, it's
possible to use httptunnel and, say, telnet or PPP to connect to
a computer outside the firewall.

If you still don't understand what this is all about, maybe you
can find some useful information in the FAQ file.
