The WWW::Mechanize::GZip module tries to fetch a URL by requesting
gzip-compression from the web server.

If the response contains a header with 'Content-Encoding: gzip',
it decompresses the response in order to get the original
(uncompressed) content.

This module will help to reduce bandwith fetching webpages, if
supported by the web server. If the web server does not support
gzip-compression, no decompression will be made.

This modules is a direct subclass of WWW::Mechanize and will
therefore support any methods provided by WWW::Mechanize.
