The LWP::Protocol::http10 module provide support for using HTTP/1.0 protocol
with LWP. To use it you need to call LWP::Protocol::implementor() to override
the standard handler for http URLs.

This module used to be bundled with the libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
v6.02 as part of the general cleanup for the 6-series. LWP::Protocol::http10 is
deprecated.
