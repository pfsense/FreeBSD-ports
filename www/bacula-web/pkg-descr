Bacula-web is a php based web program that provides you a summarized output
of jobs that have already run. It obtains its information from your catalog
database. Aside from a nice graphical display, it provides summaries of your
jobs, as well as graphs of job usage. This is a fairly high level bacula
management tool. Here are a few points that one user made concerning this
important tool:

- It is web-based so can be accessed from anywhere.
- It is "read only" users can examine the state of the backups but not write
to anything and therefore do no damage
- It packs a phenomenal amount of information into a single web-page - that I
credit as being very good design!

The documentation for bacula-web can be found in a separate bacula-web
document in the bacula-docs release.
