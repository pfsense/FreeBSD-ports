mod_fcgid is a high performance alternative to mod_cgi or mod_cgid,
which starts a sufficient number instances of the CGI program to
handle concurrent requests, and these programs remain running to
handle further incoming requests. It is favored by the PHP developers,
for example, as a preferred alternative to running mod_php in-process,
delivering very similar performance.
