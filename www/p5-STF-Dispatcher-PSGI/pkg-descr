STF::Dispatcher::PSGI implements the basic STF Protocol
(http://stf-storage.github.com) dispatcher component. It does not know
how to actually store or retrieve data, so you must implement that
portion yourself.

The reason this exists is mainly to allow you to testing systems that
interact with STF servers. For example, setting up the main STF
implementation is quite a pain if all you want to do is to test your
application, but with this module, you can easily create a dummy STF
dispatcher.
