Catalyst::Controller::REST implements a mechanism for building RESTful
services in Catalyst.  It does this by extending the normal Catalyst
dispatch mechanism to allow for different subroutines to be called based
on the HTTP Method requested, while also transparently handling all the
serialization/deserialization for you.
