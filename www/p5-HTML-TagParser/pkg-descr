HTML::TagParser is a pure Perl implementaion for parsing HTML files.
This module provides some methods like DOM. This module is not strict
about XHTML format because many of HTML pages are not strict. You know,
many pages use <br> elemtents instead of <br/> and have <p> elements
which are not closed.

This module natively understands a character set of document by reading
its meta element.

 <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=Shift_JIS">

The parsed document's encoding is converted as this class's fixed
internal encoding "UTF-8".
