Bozohttpd is a small and secure HTTP version 1.1 server. Its main feature
is the lack of features, reducing the code size and improving verifiability.
This is also the minimal web server that is shipped by default in NetBSD.

It supports SSL, CGI/1.1, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/0.9, ~user translations,
virtual hosting support, as well as multiple IP-based servers on a single
machine. It is capable of serving pages via the IPv6 protocol. It has no
configuration file by design. Many features are enabled with CLI options.

For extra security, unused features can be excluded when you build the port:

    o Support for blacklistd(8) to avoid DoS abuse
    o Common Gateway Interface (CGI) support (-C, -c, -E, -e)
    o Optional daemon mode (-b)
    o Debug support (-d)
    o Automatic directory index if index.html is missing (-X)
    o Dynamic content based on file suffixes (-C, -M)
    o Basic authentication with .htpasswd files
    o SSL/TLS for HTTPS requests (-Z, -z)
    o Lua scripts for dynamic content (-L)
    o Optional /~user transformation (-e, -p, -u)
