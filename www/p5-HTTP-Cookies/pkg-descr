The HTTP::Cookies class is for objects that represent a "cookie jar" -- that is,
a database of all the HTTP cookies that a given LWP::UserAgent object knows
about.

Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both
store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more
information about cookies refer to Cookie Spec and Cookie Central. This module
also implements the new style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of
cookies are supposed to be able to coexist happily.

Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of
Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to
initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a HTTP::Cookies
object can be saved in and restored from files.
