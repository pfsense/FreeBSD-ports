Catalyst::Model::CDBI::Plain is a Model class for Catalyst to be used
with user-specified Class::DBI classes.

It does not automatically set anything up or create relationships;
this is left to the user. This module can be used with existing
Class::DBI classes, so that they can be used with Catalyst, or as a
way of writing CDBI-based Model classes within Catalyst.
