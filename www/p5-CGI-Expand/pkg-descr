Converts a CGI query into structured data using a dotted name convention
similar to TT2.

expand_cgi works with CGI.pm, Apache::Request or anything with an appropriate
"param" method. Or you can use expand_hash directly.

If you prefer to use a different flattening convention then CGI::Expand can
be subclassed.
