FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs
with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

 * Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go.

 * Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.

 * Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.

 * Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.

 * Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.

 * Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter
   declaration. Fewer bugs.

 * Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.

 * Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for
   APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
