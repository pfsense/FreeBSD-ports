The Notes app is a distraction free notes taking app. It supports
formatting using Markdown syntax. Notes are saved as files in your
Nextcloud, so you can view and edit them with every Nextcloud client.
Furthermore, a separate RESTful API allows for an easy integration into
third-party apps (currently, there are notes apps for Android and iOS which
allow convenient access to your Nextcloud notes). Further features include
marking notes as favorites and future versions will provide categories for
better organization.
