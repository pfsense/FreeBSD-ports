You can activate your owncast server by typing
sysrc owncast_enable="YES"
service owncast start

Your server is listening via http on port 8080, just point your browser to
http://<ip_address>:8080/admin to configure it (default user is admin / abc123).

It is recommended to use a reverse proxy (eg. nginx) to serve your owncast
instance via https - see https://owncast.online/docs/sslproxies/ for more info
