Podcastamatic automates the creation of a webpage and a RSS feed
for your podcast, based on MP3 tags. A webpage can either be
automatically generated from scratch or generated from a template
you create. An RSS feed is an XML file that is required to be listed
in most popular podcast directories. Podcastamatic is highly customizable.
