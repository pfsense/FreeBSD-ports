Compress::LeadingBlankSpaces - Perl class to compress leading blank
spaces in (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) web content.

This class provides the functionality for the most simple web content
compression.

Basically, the outgoing web content (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) contains
a lot of leading blank spaces, because of being structured on
development stage.  Usually, the client browser ignores leading
blank spaces.  Indeed, the amount of those blank spaces is as
significant as 10 to 20 percent of the length of regular web page.
We can reduce this part of web traffic on busy servers with no
visible impact on transferred web content, especially for old
browsers incapable to understand modern content compression.

The main functionality of this class is concentrated within the
"squeeze_string" member function that is supposed to be used inside
the data transfer loop on server side.  The rest of the class is
developed in order to serve possible exceptions, like pre-formatted
data within HTML.
