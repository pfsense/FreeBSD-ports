ClearSilver is a fast, powerful, and language-neutral template system.  It is
designed to make it easy to create template driven static or dynamic
websites.

ClearSilver is first and foremost designed to be extremely fast.  It is coded
completely in C and exported to your script language of choice (i.e. Python,
Perl).  As a result, it is notably faster than template systems written in a
script language.  However, its design has additional benefits.  It is also one
of the only template systems available which allows you to easily
mix-and-match multiple programming languages with the same templates, even
on the same page.  This allows you to optimize your website by writing
C-modules to handle speed-sensitive sections, while leaving the majority of
your site in easy to write script code.
