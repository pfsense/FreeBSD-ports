Search for an article in Wikipedia. The search results feature
pagination and a little preview is generated when you select a result.

* Read:

When opening an article wiki-tui generates and displays a table of
contents where you can quickly jump to any section in the article. The
main article currently supports links and lists with more features like
tables and images planned. Although wiki-tui was designed to be used
with a keyboard, it also supports mouse input.

* Customize:

- Themes (changing colors of the whole program and individual parts)
- Keybindings (so you don't have to use the arrow keys for navigation)
- Toggle specific features of wiki-tui:
- Disable the table of contents
- Disable links
- Logging
- Change the language of Wikipedia Articles
