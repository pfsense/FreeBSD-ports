The objective of the package is to provide a fast and essential HTML check (esp.
for CGI scripts where response time is important) to prevent a piece of user
input HTML code from messing up the rest of a file, i.e., to minimize and
localize any possible damage created by including a piece of user input HTML
text in a dynamic document.

HTMLQuickCheck checks for unmatched < and >, unmatched tags and improper
nesting, which could ruin the rest of the document.  Attributes and elements
with optional end tags are not checked, as they should not cause disasters with
any decent browsers (they should ignore any unrecognized tags and attributes
according to the standard).  A piece of HTML that passes HTMLQuickCheck may not
necessarily be valid HTML, but it would be very unlikely to screw others but
itself. A valid piece of HTML that doesn't pass the HTMLQuickCheck is however
very likely to screw many browsers(which are obviously broken in terms of strict
conformance).

HTMLQuickCheck currently supports HTML 1.0, 2.x (draft), 3.0 (draft) and
netscape extensions (1.1).
