Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Trunk uses a simple,
optional-config pattern for building & bundling WASM, JS snippets & other
assets (images, css, scss) via a source HTML file.

Trunk ships with a built-in server for rapid development workflows, as well
as support for HTTP & WebSocket proxies.

Trunk watches your application for changes and triggers builds for you,
including automatic browser reloading.
