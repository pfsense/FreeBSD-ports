If you get wrong colors when watching videos, this is probably because your
system does not support hardware acceleration (see bug 237277): you can
disable it by starting the browser from command line with the
--qt-flag disable-gpu option:

  qutebrowser --qt-flag disable-gpu

Or you can set 'qt.force_software_rendering' qutebrowser option to 'chromium':

  :set qt.force_software_rendering chromium
