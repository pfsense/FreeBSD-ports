This port delivers advance bug- and security fixes for the Apache HTTP/2
Module. For most users, the www/apache24 bundled module is sufficient.

This Apache module implements the "h2" (HTTP2 over TLS) and "h2c" (HTTP2
over plain HTTP connections via Upgrade) for Apache httpd. You can enable
it for the whole server or for specific virtual hosts only.
