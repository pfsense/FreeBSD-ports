This action implements a sensible default end action, which will forward
to the first available view, unless status is set to 3xx, or there is a
response body. It also allows you to pass dump_info=1 to the url in
order to force a debug screen, while in debug mode.

If you have more than 1 view, you can specify which one to use with the
'view' config setting.
