WWW::Mediawiki::Client provides a very simple cvs-like interface for Mediawiki
driven WikiWiki websites, such as http://www.wikitravel.org|Wikitravel or
http://www.wikipedia.org|Wikipedia. The interface mimics the two most basic
cvs commands: update and commit with similarly named methods. Each of these
has a shorter alias, as in cvs.
