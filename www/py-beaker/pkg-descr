Beaker is built on code from the package MyghtyUtils, originally used
in the Myghty project. It implements a full set of cache functionality
along with sessions that can utilize the caches.

Beaker includes Cache and Session WSGI middleware to ease integration
with WSGI capable frameworks, and is automatically used by Pylons.

Features
    * Fast, robust performance
    * Multiple reader/single writer lock system to avoid duplicate
      simultaneous cache creation
    * Cache back-ends include dbm, file, memory, memcached, and
      database (Using SQLAlchemy for multiple-db vendor support)
    * Signed cookie's to prevent session hijacking/spoofing
    * Extensible Container object to support new back-ends
    * Cache's can be divided into namespaces (to represent templates,
      objects, etc.) then keyed for different copies
    * Create functions for automatic call-backs to create new cache
      copies after expiration
    * Fine-grained toggling of back-ends, keys, and expiration per
      Cache object
