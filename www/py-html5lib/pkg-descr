HTML parser designed to follow the WHATWG HTML5 specification. The parser is
designed to handle all flavours of HTML and parses invalid documents using
well-defined error handling rules compatible with the behaviour of major
desktop web browsers.

Output is to a tree structure; the current release supports output to a custom
tree similar to DOM and to ElementTree.
