Vigil is an open-source Status Page you can host on your infrastructure, used
to monitor all your servers and apps, and visible to your users (on a domain
of your choice).

It is useful in microservices contexts to monitor both apps and backends. If a
node goes down in your infrastructure, you receive a status change notification
in a Slack channel, Email, Twilio SMS or/and XMPP.
