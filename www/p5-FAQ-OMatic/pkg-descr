The Faq-O-Matic is a CGI-based system that automates the process of
maintaining a FAQ (or Frequently Asked Questions list). It allows
visitors to your FAQ to take part in keeping it up-to-date. A
permission system also makes it useful as a help-desk application,
bug-tracking database, or documentation system.
