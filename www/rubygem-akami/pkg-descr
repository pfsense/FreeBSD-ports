Akami is a Ruby library for building WS-Security headers in SOAP requests. It
lets you create security elements like UsernameTokens, timestamps, and
namespaces, following the WS-Security specification.

It's commonly used with SOAP clients like Savon, but can also be helpful in
other Ruby applications that need standards-compliant SOAP authentication.
