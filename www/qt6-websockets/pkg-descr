WebSocket is a web-based protocol designed to enable a two-way interactive
communication session between a client application and a remote host. It
enables the two entities to send data back and forth if the initial handshake
succeeds.

The Qt WebSockets module provides C++ and QML interfaces that enable Qt
applications to act as a server that can process WebSocket requests, or a
client that can consume data received from the server, or both.
