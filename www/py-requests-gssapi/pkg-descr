Requests is an HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings. This
library adds optional GSSAPI authentication support and supports mutual
authentication.

It provides a fully backward-compatible shim for the old
python-requests-kerberos library.

A more powerful interface is provided by the HTTPSPNEGOAuth component,
but this is of course not guaranteed to be compatible. Documentation
below is written toward the new interface.
