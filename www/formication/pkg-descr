Formication is a form processor which can send custom-formatted email,
save form data to custom-formatted files, and reply to the user with
a custom-formatted response.  Formication is also able to require that
certain fields be filled in.  All configuration is done with simple
templates, all of the templates for a given form being within the same
file.
