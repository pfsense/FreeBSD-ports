Emplacken is a tool for managing a set of Plack applications based on config
files. It also adds support for privilege dropping and error logs to those Plack
servers that don't support these features natively.

It works be reading a config file and using that to generate a PSGI application
file based on your config. It knows how to generate Catalyst, Mojo, and Mason
app files natively. For other apps, or more complicated setups, you can supply a
template to Emplacken and it will use that to generate the PSGI app.
