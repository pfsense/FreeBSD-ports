Image::Delivery - Efficient transformation and delivery of web images

Many web applications generate or otherwise deliver graphics as part
of their interface. Getting the delivery of these images right is
tricky, and developers usually need to make trade-offs in order
to get a usable mechanism.

Image::Delivery is an extremely sophisticated module for delivering
these generated images. It is designed to be powerful, flexible,
extensible, scalable, secure, stable and correct, and use a minimum
of resources.
