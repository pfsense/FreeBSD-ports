Semiphemeral protects your privacy by making it easy for you to automatically
delete years of old tweets while giving you control over exactly which tweets
you want to make sure you keep.

You can set Semiphemeral to, for example, automatically delete your tweets that
are older than 30 days unless they have at least 10 retweets or at least 20
likes (all these numbers are configurable).
