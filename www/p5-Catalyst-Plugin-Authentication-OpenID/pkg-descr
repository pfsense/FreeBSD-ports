Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::OpenID implements support for OpenID
authentication in a Catalyst application. For more information on OpenID, take a
look at http://www.openid.net/.

In most cases, you'll want to use this plugin in combination with a session
plugin for Catalyst. For example, Catalyst::Plugin::Session::FastMmap, which
uses a memory-mapped database to store session data.
