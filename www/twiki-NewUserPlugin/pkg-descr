This plugin is of use in those cases where TWiki users are registered
and authenticated externally, for example using LDAP.  So users are not
registered to TWiki using its own registration workflow and therefore
don't have a user topic in the Main web.  This plugin fills that gap and
creates a user's topic if it does not yet exist.
