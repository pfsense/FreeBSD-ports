ABI Generic Analysis and Instrumentation Library

This project aims at providing a C++ library for constructing, manipulating,
serializing and de-serializing ABI-relevant artifacts. The set of artifacts
that we are interested in is made of constructions like types, variables,
functions and declarations of a given library or program. For a given program
or library, this set of constructions is called an ABI corpus.

Thus the project aims at providing a library to manipulate ABI corpora, compare
them, provide detailed information about their differences and help build tools
to infer interesting conclusions about these differences.
