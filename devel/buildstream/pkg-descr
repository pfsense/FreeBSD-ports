BuildStream is a Free Software tool for integrating software stacks.

It takes inspiration, lessons and use-cases from various projects including
Bazel, OBS, Reproducible Builds, Yocto, Baserock, Buildroot, Aboriginal, GNOME
Continuous, JHBuild, Flatpak Builder and Android repo.

BuildStream supports multiple build-systems (e.g. autotools, cmake, cpan,
distutils, make, meson, qmake, pip) through its core plugins. External plugins
allow the creation of a range of output formats (e.g. debian packages, flatpak
runtimes, system images) for multiple platforms and chipsets.

BuildStream's core users are application developers and system integrators who
create production-ready software systems that need to be maintained efficiently
and reliably in the long term.
