This is a Python implementation of Project Fluent, a localization framework
designed to unleash the entire expressive power of natural language
translations.

Project Fluent keeps simple things simple and makes complex things possible. The
syntax used for describing translations is easy to read and understand. At the
same time it allows, when necessary, to represent complex concepts from natural
languages like gender, plurals, conjugations, and others.
