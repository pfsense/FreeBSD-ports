OCamlbuild is a generic build tool, that has built-in rules for building
OCaml library and programs.

In recent years, the OCaml community has converged towards a more recent
and faster build tool: Dune.  It is available as `devel/ocaml-dune' port.
When choosing a build system, one should probably use Dune instead.
