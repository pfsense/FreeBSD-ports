When 'time' is required, Time is extended with additional methods for parsing
and converting Times.

This library extends the Time class with the following conversions between date
strings and Time objects:
- date-time defined by RFC 2822
- HTTP-date defined by RFC 2616.
- dateTime defined by XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes (ISO 8601)
- various formats handled by Date._parse
- custom formats handled by Date._strptime
