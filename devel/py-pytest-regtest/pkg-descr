pytest-regtest is a plugin for pytest to implement regression testing.

Unlike functional testing, regression testing does not test whether the software
produces the correct results, but whether it behaves as it did before changes
were introduced.

More specifically, pytest-regtest provides snapshot testing, which implements
regression testing by recording data within a test function and comparing this
recorded output to a previously recorded reference output.
