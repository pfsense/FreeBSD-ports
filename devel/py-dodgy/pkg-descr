Dodgy is a very basic tool to run against your codebase to search for "dodgy"
looking values. It is a series of simple regular expressions designed to detect
things such as accidental SCM diff checkins, or passwords or secret keys hard
coded into files.

While this is primarily aimed at open source projects (for whom a publicly
available secret key is pretty dangerous), it can also be used in private
projects, with the caveat that it will point out things which are not a problem
for private projects and is not configurable enough currently to change that.

Another note - this tool is probably best run pre-commit, since it will
hopefully prevent dodgy things being checked in. To automatically execute before
a commit use a git pre-commit hook.
