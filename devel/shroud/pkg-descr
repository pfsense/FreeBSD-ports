Shroud is a tool for creating a Fortran or Python interface to a C or C++
library. It can also create a C API for a C++ library.

The user creates a YAML file with the C/C++ declarations to be wrapped along
with some annotations to provide semantic information and code generation
options. Shroud produces a wrapper for the library. The generated code is
highly-readable and intended to be similar to code that would be hand-written to
create the bindings.
