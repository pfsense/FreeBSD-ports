ghq provides a way to organize remote repository clones, like go
get does.  When you clone a remote repository with ghq, it creates
a directory under a specific root directory using the remote
repository URL's host and path.

You can also list local repositories, jump into local repositories,
and bulk get repositories by list of URLs.

It supports many contemporary VCS like Git, Mercurial, Fossil, SVN,
Bazaar, Darcs.
