Rash is an extension to Hashie. Rash subclasses Hashie::Mash to convert all keys
in the hash to underscore. The purpose of this is when working w/ Java (or any
other apis) that return hashes (including nested) that have camelCased keys. You
will now be able to access those keys through underscored key names (camelCase
still available).
