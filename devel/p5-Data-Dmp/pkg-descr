Data::Dmp is a Perl dumper like Data::Dumper. It's compact (only about 200 lines
of code long), starts fast and does not use any non-core modules except
Regexp::Stringify when dumping regexes. It produces compact single-line output
(similar to Data::Dumper::Concise). It roughly has the same speed as
Data::Dumper (usually a bit faster for smaller structures) and faster than
Data::Dump, but does not offer the various formatting options. It supports
dumping objects, regexes, circular structures, coderefs. Its code is first based
on Data::Dump: I removed all the parts that I don't need, particularly the
pretty formatting stuffs) and added some features that I need like proper regex
dumping and coderef deparsing.
