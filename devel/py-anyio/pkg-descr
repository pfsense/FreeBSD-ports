AnyIO is a asynchronous compatibility API that allows applications and libraries
written against it to run unmodified on asyncio, curio and trio.

It bridges the following functionality:
- Task groups
- Cancellation
- Threads
- Signal handling
- Asynchronous file I/O
- Subprocesses
- Inter-task synchronization and communication (locks, conditions, events,
  semaphores, object streams)
- High level networking (TCP, UDP and UNIX sockets)

You can even use it together with native libraries from your selected backend in
applications. Doing this in libraries is not advisable however since it limits
the usefulness of your library.
