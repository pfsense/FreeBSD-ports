Testing a WSGI application sometimes involves starting a server at a local host
and port, then pointing your test code to that address. Instead, this library
lets you intercept calls to any specific host/port combination and redirect them
into a WSGI application importable by your test program. Thus, you can avoid
spawning multiple processes or threads to test your Web app.

wsgi_intercept works with a variety of HTTP clients in Python 2.7, 3.5 and
beyond, and in pypy.
- urllib2
- urllib.request
- httplib
- http.client
- httplib2
- requests
- urllib3

wsgi_intercept works by replacing httplib.HTTPConnection with a subclass,
wsgi_intercept.WSGI_HTTPConnection. This class then redirects specific
server/port combinations into a WSGI application by emulating a socket. If no
intercept is registered for the host and port requested, those requests are
passed on to the standard handler.
