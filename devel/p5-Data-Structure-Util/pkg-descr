Data::Structure::Util - Change nature of data within a structure

Data::Structure::Util is a toolbox to manipulate the data inside
a data structure. It can process an entire tree and perform the
operation requested on each appropriate element.

For example: It can transform all strings within a data structure
to utf8 or transform any utf8 string back to the default encoding.
It can remove the blessing on any reference. It can collect all
the objects or detect if there is a circular reference.

It is written in C for decent speed.
