Types::Core provides syntax symplifier for type checking. It allows easy,
non-quoted usage of types as literals, and allows the standard type names to be
used as true/false check routines of references.

For the most basic functions, they take either 0 or 1 arguments. If 1 parameter,
then they test it to see if the ref is of the given type (blessed or not). If
false, undef is returned, of true, the ref, itself is returned.

For no args, they return literals of themselves, allowing the named strings to
be used as Literals without quotes.
