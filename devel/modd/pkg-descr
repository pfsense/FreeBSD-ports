Modd is a developer tool that triggers commands and manages daemons in response
to filesystem changes.

If you use modd, you should also look at devd, a compact HTTP daemon for
developers. Devd integrates with modd, allowing you to trigger in-browser
live-reload with modd.

devd (www/devd) is a sister-project of modd.
