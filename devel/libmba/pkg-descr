The libmba package is a collection of mostly independent C modules potentially
useful to any project. There are hashmap, linkedlist, and stack ADTs, a DOM-
like interface that can load and store XML files for simple XML processing, a
module for managing error codes and associated messages across separate C
libraries, and more.
