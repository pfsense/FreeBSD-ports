Many Perl distributions use a Build.PL file instead of a Makefile.PL file to
drive distribution configuration, build, test and installation. Traditionally,
Build.PL uses Module::Build as the underlying build system. This module provides
a simple, lightweight, drop-in replacement.

Whereas Module::Build has over 6,700 lines of code; this module has less than
70, yet supports the features needed by most pure-Perl distributions.
