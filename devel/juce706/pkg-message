You installed JUCE: C++ application framework.

The main application that you probably need is Projucer. It allows you
to develop, manage and deploy cross-platform applications.

Projucer currently can't create makefiles on Linux/BSD platforms because
this feature has not yet been made available by JUCE developers on these
platforms.
