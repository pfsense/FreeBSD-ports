For correct operation, maximum socket buffer size must be tuned
by performing the following command as root :

# sysctl kern.ipc.maxsockbuf=18874368

To preserve this setting across reboots, append the following
to /etc/sysctl.conf :

kern.ipc.maxsockbuf=18874368

Currently, knet will fail to work with SCTP if you do not change
the following sysctl :

# sysctl net.inet.sctp.blackhole=1

To preserve this setting across reboots if you want to use knet with SCTP,
append the following to /etc/sysctl.conf :

net.inet.sctp.blackhole=1
