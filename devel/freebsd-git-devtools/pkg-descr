The git-arc utility creates and manages FreeBSD Phabricator reviews
based on git commits.  It is a git plugin that provides a wrapper around
arc.

The arc command has a few limitations that make it awkward for FreeBSD
development:

- Arcanist uses its own commit log template with a format does not match
  FreeBSD's template.

- Arcanist presumes a model where all the commits in a development
  branch are uploaded for review as a single Differential revision.
  When working on a feature branch with multiple commits, it is usually
  more efficient to review each commit individually.

git-arc mitigates these limitations.
