GNU shtool -- The GNU Portable Shell Tool
Copyright (c) 1994-2004 Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@engelschall.com>

The GNU shtool program is a compilation of small but very stable and
portable shell scripts into a single shell tool. All ingredients were
in successful use over many years in various free software projects.
The compiled shtool program is intended to be used inside the source
tree of free software packages. There it can take over various (usually
non-portable) tasks related to the building and installation of such
packages.
