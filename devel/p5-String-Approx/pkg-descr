String::Approx lets you match and substitute strings
approximately.  With this you can emulate errors: typing
errors, spelling errors, closely related vocabularies
(colour color), genetic mutations (GAG ACT), abbreviations
(McScot, MacScot).
EXTREMELY USEFUL FOR WRITING LANGUAGE TESTS AND QUIZZES !
