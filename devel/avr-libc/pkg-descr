avr-libc -- a C and math library for the Atmel AVR controller family

This library implements a subset of common C library functions, some
Atmel AVR specific additions (like handling AVR's IO facilities,
EEPROM etc.), as well as a 32-bit floating point math library (-lm).

Everything is designed and implemented to cooperate with avr-gcc and
avr-binutils.
