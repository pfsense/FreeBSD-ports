nose3 is a drop-in fork of nose v1 that is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python
3.3-3.10 without using lib2to3 or other compatibility layer. It does not yet
support Python 3.11.

nose extends the test loading and running features of unittest, making it easier
to write, find and run tests.

By default, nose will run tests in files or directories under the current
working directory whose names include "test" or "Test" at a word boundary (like
"test_this" or "functional_test" or "TestClass" but not "libtest"). Test output
is similar to that of unittest, but also includes captured stdout output from
failing tests, for easy print-style debugging.

These features, and many more, are customizable through the use of plugins.
Plugins included with nose provide support for doctest, code coverage and
profiling, flexible attribute-based test selection, output capture and more.
More information about writing plugins may be found on in the nose API
documentation.
