Devise::PwnedPassword is a Devise extension that checks user passwords against
the PwnedPasswords dataset.

It checks for compromised ("pwned") passwords in 2 different places/ways:
- As a standard model validation using pwned. This:
  - prevents new users from being created (signing up) with a compromised
    password
  - prevents existing users from changing their password to a password that is
    known to be compromised
- (Optionally) Whenever a user signs in, checks if their current password is
  compromised and shows a warning if it is.
