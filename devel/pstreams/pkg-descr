PStreams allows you to run another program from your C++ application and to
transfer data between the two programs similar to shell pipelines.

In the simplest case, a PStreams class is like a C++ wrapper for the POSIX.2
functions popen(3) and pclose(3), using C++ iostreams instead of C's stdio
library.

The library provides class templates in the style of the standard iostreams that
can be used with any ISO C++ compiler on a POSIX platform. The classes use a
streambuf class that uses fork(2) and the exec(2) family of functions to create
a new process and creates up to three pipes to write/read data to/from the
process.
