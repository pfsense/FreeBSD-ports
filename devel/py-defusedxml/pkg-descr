Defusing XML bombs and other exploits

The results of an attack on a vulnerable XML library can be fairly dramatic.
With just a few hundred Bytes of XML data an attacker can occupy several
Gigabytes of memory within seconds. An attacker can also keep CPUs busy for
a long time with a small to medium size request.  This library prevents
such issues.
