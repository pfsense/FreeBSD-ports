This is a Perl-based make replacement, but does not provide make
compatibility. It has a number of powerful capabilities not found
in other software construction systems, including make.

Cons is a system for constructing, primarily, software, but is
quite different from previous software construction systems. Cons
was designed from the ground up to deal easily with the construction
of software spread over multiple source directories. Cons makes it
easy to create build scripts that are simple, understandable and
maintainable. Cons ensures that complex software is easily and
accurately reproducible.
