Tcllib is  a collection  of utility  modules for Tcl.  The intent  is to
collect commonly  used function into  a single library, which  users can
rely on to be available and stable.

There  are  too many  modules  now  to  list  here. Browse  the  on-line
documentation at

	http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/doc/

to get the idea.

This port installs pure-Tcl versions of the modules only.
C-implementations -- for some of the modules -- can be added by
installing devel/tcllibc port.
