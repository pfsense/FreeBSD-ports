This perl package uses perl5 objects to make it easy for manipulating
spreadsheet data among disk files, database, and Web publishing.

A table object contains a header and a two-dimensional array of scalars. Four
class methods Data::fromFile, Data::Table::fromCSV, Data::Table::fromTSV, and
Data::Table::fromSQL allow users to create a table object from a CSV/TSV file or
a database SQL selection in a snap.

Table methods provide basic access, add, delete row(s) or column(s) operations,
as well as more advanced sub-table extraction, table sorting, record matching
via keywords or patterns, table merging, and web publishing. Data::Table class
also provides a straightforward interface to other popular Perl modules such as
DBI and GD::Graph.
