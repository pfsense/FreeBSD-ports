Curses::Forms is designed to provide high level APIs for rapid user interface
design on the console in Perl. Based on Curses::Widgets, Curses::Forms provide
a flexible OO framework to manage a collection of widgets on forms and dialogs.

While intended to be used in the Curses::Application framework, it can also be
used alone with Curses::Widgets for quick and dirty interfaces.
