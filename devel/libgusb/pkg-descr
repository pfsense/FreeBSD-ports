GUsb is a GObject wrapper for libusb1 that makes it easy to do asynchronous
control, bulk and interrupt transfers with proper cancellation and integration
into a mainloop. This makes it easy to integrate low level USB transfers with
your high-level application or system daemon.

Not everything you can do in libusb1 is wrapped, although we'll accept feature
requests (with patches) if it makes sense.
