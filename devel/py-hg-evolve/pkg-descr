evolve is a Mercurial extension for faster and safer mutable history. It
implements the changeset evolution concept for Mercurial.

- It offers a safe and simple way to refine changesets locally and
  propagate those changes to other repositories.
- It can automatically detect and handle the complex issues that can
  arise from exchanging draft changesets.
- It even makes it possible for multiple developers to safely rewrite
  the same parts of history in a distributed way.
- It fully respects the Phases concept so users will only be able to
  rewrite parts of the history that are safe to change. Phases have been
  part of Mercurial since early 2012.
