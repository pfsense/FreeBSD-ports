pytest-random-order is a pytest plugin that randomises the order of tests. This
can be useful to detect a test that passes just because it happens to run after
an unrelated test that leaves the system in a favourable state.

The plugin allows user to control the level of randomness they want to introduce
and to disable reordering on subsets of tests. Tests can be rerun in a specific
order by passing a seed value reported in a previous test run.
