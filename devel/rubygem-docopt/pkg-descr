Rubygem implementation of docopt.

Docopt helps you:
- define an interface for your command-line app, and
- automatically generate a parser for it.

Docopt is based on conventions that have been used in help messages for decades
and man pages for describing a program's interface. An interface description in
docopt is such a help message, but formalized.
