Module::Extract is a convenience base class for creating module that work with
Perl distributions. Its purpose is to take care of the mechanisms of locating
and extracting a Perl distribution so that your module can do something specific
to the distribution.

This module was originally created to provide an abstraction for the extraction
logic for both Module::Inspector and Module::P4P and to allow additional
features to be added in the future without having to modify both of them,
because the general problem of "locate, download, and expand a distribution"
is one that is almost ideal for adding additional features down the line.
