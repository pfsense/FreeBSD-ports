VOLK is a sub-project of GNU Radio. Please see http://libvolk.org for bug
tracking, documentation, source code, and contact information about VOLK.

VOLK is the Vector-Optimized Library of Kernels. It is a library that
contains kernels of hand-written SIMD code for different mathematical
operations. Since each SIMD architecture can be very different and no
compiler has yet come along to handle vectorization properly or highly
efficiently, VOLK approaches the problem differently.

For each architecture or platform that a developer wishes to vectorize for,
a new proto-kernel is added to VOLK. At runtime, VOLK will select the correct
proto-kernel. In this way, the users of VOLK call a kernel for performing
the operation that is platform/architecture agnostic. This allows us to
write portable SIMD code.
