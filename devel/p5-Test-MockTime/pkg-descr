Test::MockTime was created to enable test suites to test code at
specific points in time. Specifically it overrides localtime, gmtime and
time at compile time and then relies on the user supplying a mock time
via set_relative_time, set_absolute_time or set_fixed_time to alter
future calls to gmtime, time or localtime.
