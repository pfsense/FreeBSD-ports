Web Services Made Easy (WSME) simplifies the writing of REST web services by
providing simple yet powerful typing, removing the need to directly manipulate
the request and the response objects.

WSME can work standalone or on top of your favorite Python web (micro)framework,
so you can use both your preferred way of routing your REST requests and most of
the features of WSME that rely on the typing system like:
- Alternate protocols, including those supporting batch-calls
- Easy documentation through a Sphinx extension

WSME is originally a rewrite of TGWebServices with a focus on extensibility,
framework-independence and better type handling.
