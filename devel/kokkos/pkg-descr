Kokkos C++ Performance Portability Programming EcoSystem: The Programming Model
- Parallel Execution and Memory Abstraction.

Kokkos Core implements a programming model in C++ for writing performance
portable applications targeting all major HPC platforms. For that purpose it
provides abstractions for both parallel execution of code and data management.
Kokkos is designed to target complex node architectures with N-level memory
hierarchies and multiple types of execution resources. It currently can use
CUDA, HPX, OpenMP and Pthreads as backend programming models with several other
backends in development.
