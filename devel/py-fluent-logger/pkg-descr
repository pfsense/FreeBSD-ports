Many web/mobile applications generate huge amount of event logs (cf. login,
logout, purchase, follow, etc). To analyze these event logs could be really
valuable for improving the service. However, the challenge is collecting these
logs easily and reliably.

Fluentd solves that problem by having: easy installation, small footprint,
plugins, reliable buffering, log forwarding, etc.

fluent-logger-python is a Python library, to record the events from Python
application.
