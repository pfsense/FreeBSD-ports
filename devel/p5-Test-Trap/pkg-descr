Test::Trap is primarily (but not exclusively) for use in test scripts: a block
eval on steroids, configurable and extensible, but by default trapping (Perl)
STDOUT, STDERR, warnings, exceptions, would-be exit codes, and return values
from boxed blocks of test code.

The values collected by the latest trap can then be queried or tested through a
special trap object.
