This module allows you to specify your project-wide or even company-wide
Moose meta-policy.

Most all of Moose's features can be customized through the use of custom
metaclasses, however fiddling with the metaclasses can be hairy.
Moose::Policy removes most of that hairiness and makes it possible to
cleanly contain a set of meta-level customizations in one easy to use
module.
