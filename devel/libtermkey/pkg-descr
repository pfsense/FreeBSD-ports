This library allows easy processing of keyboard entry from terminal-based
programs. It handles all the necessary logic to recognise special keys,
UTF-8 combining, and so on, with a simple interface.

Use of this library for new programs is discouraged. It is being maintained
for legacy purposes only. For writing new programs, please use  libtickit instead.
