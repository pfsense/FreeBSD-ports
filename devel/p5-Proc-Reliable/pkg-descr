The Proc::Reliable is intended to be a method for simple, reliable
and configurable subprocess execution in PERL. It includes all the
functionality of the backticks operator and system() functions,
plus many uses of fork/exec, open2() and open3(). Proc::Reliable
incorporates a number of options, including sending data to the
subprocess on STDIN, collecting STDOUT and STDERR separately or
together, killing hung processes, timeouts and automatic retries.
