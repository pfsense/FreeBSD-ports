Fully featured git bug tracker that:

* Is fully embeded in git: you only need
  your git repository to have a bug tracker.
* Is distributed: use your normal git remote
  to collaborate, push and pull your bugs!
* Works offline: in a plane or under the sea?
  Keep reading and writing bugs!
* Prevents vendor lock-in: your usual service
  is down or went bad? You already have a full backup.
* Is fast: listing bugs or opening them is a matter
  of milliseconds.
* Doesn't pollute your project: no files are added
  in your project.
* Integrates with your tooling: use the UI you like
  (CLI, terminal, web) or integrate with your existing
  tools through the CLI or the GraphQL API.
* Bridges to other bug trackers: use bridges to import
  and export to other trackers.
