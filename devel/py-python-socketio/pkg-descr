This projects implements Socket.IO clients and servers that can run standalone
or integrated with a variety of Python web frameworks.

Socket.IO is a transport protocol that enables real-time bidirectional
event-based communication between clients (typically, though not always, web
browsers) and a server. The official implementations of the client and server
components are written in JavaScript. This package provides Python
implementations of both, each with standard and asyncio variants.
