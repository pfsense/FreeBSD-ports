Open source version of the STMicroelectronics STLINK Tools

 stlink is an open source toolset to program and debug STM32 devices and boards
manufactured by STMicroelectronics.

 It supports several so called STLINK programmer boards (and clones thereof)
which use a microcontroller chip to translate commands from USB to JTAG/SWD.
