The Qt Location API helps you create viable mapping solutions using the
data available from some of the popular location services.

The Qt Location API enables you to:
  - access and present map data,
  - support touch gesture on a specific area of the map,
  - query for a specific geographical location and route,
  - add additional layers on top, such as polylines and circles,
  - and search for places and related images.
