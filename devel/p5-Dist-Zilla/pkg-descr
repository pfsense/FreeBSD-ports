Dist::Zilla builds distributions of code to be uploaded to the CPAN.
In this respect, it is like ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build, or
Module::Install. Unlike those tools, however, it is not also a
system for installing code that has been downloaded from the CPAN.
Since it's only run by authors, and is meant to be run on a repository
checkout rather than on published, released code, it can do much
more than those tools, and is free to make much more ludicrous
demands in terms of prerequisites.
