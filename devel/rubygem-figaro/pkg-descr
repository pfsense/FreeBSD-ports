Figaro provides simple, Heroku-friendly Rails app configuration using ENV and a
single YAML file.

Figaro was written to make it easy to securely configure Rails applications.

Configuration values often include sensitive information. Figaro strives to be
secure by default by encouraging a convention that keeps configuration out of
Git.
