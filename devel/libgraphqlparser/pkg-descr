libgraphqlparser is a parser for GraphQL, a query language for describing data
requirements on complex application data models, implemented in C++11. It can be
used on its own in C++ code (or in C code via the pure C API defined in the c
subdirectory), or you can use it as the basis for an extension module for your
favorite programming language instead of writing your own parser from scratch.
