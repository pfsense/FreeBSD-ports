  message: <<EOM
The top directory for Eclipse Titan is %%PREFIX%%/%%TTCN3_DIR%%, and
binaries have been installed to %%PREFIX%%/%%TTCN3_DIR%%/bin.

You generally need to set TTCN3_DIR environment variable to the top
directory to use Eclipse Titan, while the ttcn3_start utility automatically
sets it when no TTCN3_DIR is defined.

A demo test case has been installed in %%EXAMPLESDIR%%.
