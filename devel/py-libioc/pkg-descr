This library provides programmatic access to iocage features and jails,
while aiming to be compatible with iocage_legacy, iocell, and the Python
3 version of iocage.

iocage is a jail/container manager fusioning some of the best features
and technologies the FreeBSD operating system has to offer. It is geared
for ease of use with a simple and easy to understand command syntax.
