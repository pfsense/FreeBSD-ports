Joblib is a set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in Python. In
particular, joblib offers:

  * transparent disk-caching of the output values and lazy re-evaluation
  * easy simple parallel computing
  * logging and tracing of the execution

Joblib is optimized to be fast and robust in particular on large data and has
specific optimizations for numpy arrays.
