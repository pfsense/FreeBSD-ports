ark is a parsing toolkit for Python, built with a focus on ergonomics,
performance and modularity.

Lark can parse all context-free languages. To put it simply, it means that it is
capable of parsing almost any programming language out there, and to some degree
most natural languages too.

What can it do?
- Parse all context-free grammars, and handle any ambiguity gracefully
- Build an annotated parse-tree automagically, no construction code required.
- Provide first-rate performance in terms of both Big-O complexity and measured
  run-time (considering that this is Python ;)
- Run on every Python interpreter (it's pure-python)
- Generate a stand-alone parser (for LALR(1) grammars)
- And many more features. Read ahead and find out!

Most importantly, Lark will save you time and prevent you from getting parsing
headaches.
