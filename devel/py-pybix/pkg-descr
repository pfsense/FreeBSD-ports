Python based Zabbix API utility containing helper functions and CLI
capabilities.

Takes inspiration from existing Python-Zabbix API modules like
lukecyca/pyzabbix and adubkov/py-zabbix.

While this module can be used in a similar way, the aim is to add a few out of
the box helper functions and CLI handling for a more "batteries included"
module. For example GraphImage as described in usage which enables saving
Zabbix graphs which is not possible via the API at this time.
