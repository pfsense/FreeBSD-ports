eventxx is a simple, direct, one-header inline C++ wrapper for libevent.

It's designed to be as close to use to libevent (without compromising modern
C++ programming techniques) and efficient (since all implementation is trivial
and inline, theoretically, it imposes no overhead at all) as possible.
