Zict: Composable Mutable Mappings

The dictionary / mutable mapping interface is powerful and multi-faceted.
- We store data in different locations such as in-memory, on disk, in archive
  files, etc..
- We manage old data with different policies like LRU, random eviction, etc..
- We might encode or transform data as it arrives or departs the dictionary
  through compression, encoding, etc..

To this end we build abstract MutableMapping classes that consume and build on
other MutableMappings. We can compose several of these with each other to form
intuitive interfaces over complex storage systems policies.
