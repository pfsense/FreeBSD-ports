Forge allows you to work with Git forges, such as Github and Gitlab,
from the comfort of Magit and the rest of Emacs.

Forge fetches issues, pull-requests and other data using the forge's
API and stores that in a local database. Additionally it fetches the
pull-request references using Git. Forge implements various features
that use this data but the database and pull-request refs can also be
used by third-party packages.
