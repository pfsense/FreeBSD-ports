CPAN::Testers::Common::Client is a Perl module which provides a common client
for constructing metabase facts and the legacy email message sent to CPAN
Testers in a way that is properly parsed by the extraction and report tools.
It is meant to be used by all the CPAN clients (and standalone tools) that
want/need to support the CPAN Testers infrastructure.
