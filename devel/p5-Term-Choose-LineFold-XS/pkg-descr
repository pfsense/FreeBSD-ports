Width in this context refers to the number of occupied columns of a character
string on a terminal with a monospaced font.

By default ambiguous width characters are treated as half width. If the
environment variable TC_AMBIGUOUS_WIDTH_IS_WIDE is set to a true value,
ambiguous width characters are treated as full width.
