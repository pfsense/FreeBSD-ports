pyjson5 is a Python implementation of the JSON5 data format.

JSON5 extends the JSON data interchange format to make it slightly more usable
as a configuration language:
- JavaScript-style comments (both single and multi-line) are legal.
- Object keys may be unquoted if they are legal ECMAScript identifiers
- Objects and arrays may end with trailing commas.
- Strings can be single-quoted, and multi-line string literals are allowed.

This project implements a reader and writer implementation for Python; where
possible, it mirrors the standard Python JSON API package for ease of use.

There is one notable difference from the JSON api: the load() and loads()
methods support optionally checking for (and rejecting) duplicate object keys;
pass allow_duplicate_keys=False to do so (duplicates are allowed by default).
