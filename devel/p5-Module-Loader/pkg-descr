Module::Loader provides methods for finding modules in a given namespace, and
then loading them. It is intended for use in situations where you're looking for
plugins, and then loading one or more of them.

This module was inspired by Mojo::Loader, which I have used in a number of
projects. But some people were wary of requiring Mojolicious just to get a
module loader, which prompted me to create Module::Loader.
