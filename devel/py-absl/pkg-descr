Abseil is an open source collection of libraries drawn from the most fundamental
pieces of Google internal codebase. These libraries are the nuts-and-bolts that
underpin almost everything Google runs. Bits and pieces of these APIs are
embedded in most of our open source projects, and Abseil aims to bring them
together into one comprehensive project. Abseil encompasses the most basic
building blocks of Googles codebase: code that is production-tested and will be
fully maintained for years to come.
