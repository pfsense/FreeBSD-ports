You installed %%PORTNAME%%: Go Git Service.

It is recommended to run %%PORTNAME%% as a service:
# service gogs start

To enable the service at startup you should execute the command:
sysrc %%PORTNAME%%_enable="YES"

You can also run %%PORTNAME%% manually with a command:
# %%PORTNAME%%

Connect to %%PORTNAME%% on the default port 3000:
http://localhost:3000

Configuration file is %%ETCDIR%%/conf/app.ini.
You can only edit it when %%PORTNAME%% isn't running.

%%PORTNAME_FANCY%% needs an SSH daemon, so make sure sure you execute:
sysrc sshd_enable="YES"
and sshd is configured to listen on the same port that is configured
in %%PORTNAME%%.
