This class implements a "Log::Log4perl" layout format, similar to
Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout except that the output is a JSON hash.
The JSON hash is ASCII encoded, with no newlines or other whitespace, and is
suitable for output, via Log::Log4perl appenders, to files and syslog etc.
The JSON hash can, optionally, be UTF-8 encoded.
Contextual data in the Log::Log4perl::MDC hash can be included.
