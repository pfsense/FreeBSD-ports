concurrencpp is a tasking library for C++ allowing developers to write highly
concurrent applications easily and safely by using tasks, executors and
coroutines. By using concurrencpp applications can break down big procedures
that need to be processed asynchronously into smaller tasks that run
concurrently and work in a co-operative manner to achieve the wanted result.
concurrencpp also allows applications to write parallel algorithms easily by
using parallel coroutines.
