geventhttpclient is a high performance, concurrent HTTP client library for
python using gevent.

geventhttpclient uses a fast http parser, written in C.

geventhttpclient has been specifically designed for high concurrency, streaming
and support HTTP 1.1 persistent connections. More generally it is designed for
efficiently pulling from REST APIs and streaming APIs like Twitter's.

Safe SSL support is provided by default. geventhttpclient depends on the certifi
CA Bundle. This is the same CA Bundle which ships with the Requests codebase,
and is derived from Mozilla Firefox's canonical set.
