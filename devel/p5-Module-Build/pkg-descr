Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl modules.
It is meant to be a replacement for ExtUtils::MakeMaker. Developers may alter
the behavior of the module through subclassing in a much more straightforward
way than with MakeMaker. It also does not require a make on your system - most
of the Module::Build code is pure-perl and written in a very cross-platform
way.
