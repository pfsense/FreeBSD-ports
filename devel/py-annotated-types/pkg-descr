PEP-593 added typing.Annotated as a way of adding context-specific metadata to
existing types, and specifies that Annotated[T, x] should be treated as T by any
tool or library without special logic for x.

annotated-types provides metadata objects which can be used to represent common
constraints such as upper and lower bounds on scalar values and collection
sizes, a Predicate marker for runtime checks, and descriptions of how we intend
these metadata to be interpreted. In some cases, we also note alternative
representations which do not require this package.
