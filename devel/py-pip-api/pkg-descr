Since pip is a command-line-tool, it does not have an official, supported,
importable API.

However, this does not mean that people haven't tried to import pip, usually to
end up with much headache when pip's maintainers do routine refactoring.

This project attempts to provide an importable pip API, which is fully compliant
with the recommended method of using pip from your program.
