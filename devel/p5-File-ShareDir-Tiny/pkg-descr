Quite often you want or need your Perl module (CPAN or otherwise) to have access
to a large amount of read-only data that is stored on the file-system at
run-time.

On a linux-like system, this would be in a place such as /usr/share, however
Perl runs on a wide variety of different systems, and so the use of any one
location is unreliable.

File::ShareDir::Tiny provides a more portable way to have (read-only) data for
your module.
