Parsing a program's command line arguments has always been a distraction from
the main programming task at hand. The argtable library simplifies the job by
enabling the programmer to define the command line options directly in the
source code as a static array of structs and then pass that array to argtable
library functions which parse the command line accordingly. The values
extracted from the command line are deposited directly into user-defined program
variables where they can be accessed by the main program. Argtable can also
generate descriptions of the command line syntax from that same array for
display as on-line help.
