The purpose of this package is to provide a lightweight and unified
Future API for sequential and parallel processing of R expression
via futures. The simplest way to evaluate an expression in parallel
is to use 'x %<-% { expression }' with 'plan(multisession)'. This
package implements sequential, multicore, multisession, and cluster
futures. With these, R expressions can be evaluated on the local
machine, in parallel a set of local machines, or distributed on a
mix of local and remote machines. Extensions to this package implement
additional backends for processing futures via compute cluster
schedulers, etc. Because of its unified API, there is no need to
modify any code in order switch from sequential on the local machine
to, say, distributed processing on a remote compute cluster. Another
strength of this package is that global variables and functions are
automatically identified and exported as needed, making it
straightforward to tweak existing code to make use of futures.
