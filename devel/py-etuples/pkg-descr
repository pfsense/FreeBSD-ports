Python S-expression emulation using tuple-like objects.

In computer programming, an S-expression (or symbolic expression, abbreviated
as sexpr or sexp) is an expression in a like-named notation for nested list
(tree-structured) data. S-expressions were invented for and popularized by the
programming language Lisp, which uses them for source code as well as data.
