## ### PROCESSING
##
## This file is processed three ways:
## - to replace %%variables%% with the intended values
## - to replace @tag with ## or blank as appropriate
## - to filter out lines containing ##
##
## The resulting "minified" script is used as pkg-install or pkg-deinstall
## script in the package.
##
## Lines with @tag at the beginning should be read as conditional;
## multiple @tags are read as "and", so the **rest** of the line
## only ends up in the resulting script when all the @tags are true.
##
## The file is formatted with lots of spaces between the @tags and script
## so that the shell-script itself can be read in column 24,
## e.g.                 v--- here
##
## To read the script, try `grep -v '##' pkg-change.in | cut -c 25-`
##
##
## ### ABOUT
##
## A Qt module should be listed in QtCore/qconfig-modules.h only once,
## and only if that is needed (e.g. if it has a qconfig-*.h of its own).
## In case 1 (listed), update the target file by appending and sorting:
##  - echo the new line and existing contents if any
##  - .. pipe to sort -u
##  - .. then move the sorted-uniqued output to the config-modules.h
## In case 2 (unlisted), update the target file by deleting a line
##
## Removing QtCore *may* leave behind an empty file, and in that case
## clean up the config file and directories entirely.
##
## A module with versionable binaries (like "designer" which might have
## a Qt4, Qt5 and Qt6 version).
##
##
## On deinstall, we need QT_INCDIR separately, so define variables $qi and $qc
## differently from install (which needs only $qc).
@deinstall              qi="%%QT_INCDIR%%"
@deinstall              qc="$qi/QtCore/qconfig-modules.h"
@install                qc="%%QT_INCDIR%%/QtCore/qconfig-modules.h"
                        qm="%%QT_MODNAME%%"

## Distinguish the pkg step and call the relevant shell functions defined above.

## Add the line #include qconfig-<this module>.h to the global
## qconfig-modules.h; afterwards that global file exists.
##
## We might be adding to a non-existent file, which is why there
## is the slightly-weird construction with a subshell piping to sort.
