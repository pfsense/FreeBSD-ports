Perl module for static variables without namespace pollution

Lexical::Var and Lexical::Sub implement lexical scoping of static variables and
subroutines. Although it can be used directly, it is mainly intended to be
infrastructure for modules that export particular objects.

Lexical::Var only manages variables of static duration (the kind of duration
that our and state variables have). To get a fresh variable for each invocation
of a function, use my.

Lexical::Sub is implemented through the mechanism of Lexical::Var. Its distinct
name and declaration syntax exist to make lexical subroutine declarations
clearer.
