The asynchronous RPC client-server framework and message specification
for Rigetti Quantum Cloud Services (QCS).

Implements an efficient transport protocol by using ZeroMQ (ZMQ)
sockets and MessagePack (msgpack) serialization.

Not intended to be a full-featured replacement for other frameworks
like gRPC or Apache Thrift.
