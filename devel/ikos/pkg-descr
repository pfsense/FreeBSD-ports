IKOS (Inference Kernel for Open Static Analyzers) is a static analyzer for C/C++
based on the theory of Abstract Interpretation.

IKOS provides a generic and efficient implementation of state-of-the-art
Abstract Interpretation data structures and algorithms, such as control-flow
graphs, fixpoint iterators, numerical abstract domains, etc. IKOS is independent
of a particular programming language.

IKOS also provides a C and C++ static analyzer based on LLVM. It implements
scalable analyses for detecting and proving the absence of runtime errors in C
and C++ programs.
