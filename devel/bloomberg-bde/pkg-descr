BDE stands for BDE Development Environment. Depending on the context,
BDE may refer to a suite of low-level C++ libraries, the methodology that
guides their development, or to the team that develops them. The BDE
libraries meet superior standards of design, documentation, and testing
and are the foundation of C++ development at Bloomberg. Among other things,
the BDE libraries provide an enhanced implementation of STL containers,
vocabulary types for representing common concepts (like dates and times),
and building blocks for developing multi-threaded applications and
network applications.
