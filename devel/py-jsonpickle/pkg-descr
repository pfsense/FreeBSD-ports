jsonpickle is a Python library for serialization and deserialization of complex
Python objects to and from JSON. The standard Python libraries for encoding
Python into JSON, such as the stdlib's json, simplejson, and demjson, can only
handle Python primitives that have a direct JSON equivalent (e.g. dicts, lists,
strings, ints, etc.). jsonpickle builds on top of these libraries and allows
more complex data structures to be serialized to JSON. jsonpickle is highly
configurable and extendable-allowing the user to choose the JSON backend and add
additional backends.
