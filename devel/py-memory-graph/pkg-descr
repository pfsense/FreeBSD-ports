memory-graph is a Python library that creates visual memory graphs for teaching
and debugging purposes. It helps visualize object references, mutable data
types, and the differences between shallow and deep copying in Python.

Key features:
* Generate visual representations of Python object references
* Illustrate memory layouts and object relationships
* Educational tool for understanding Python memory model
* Debugging aid for complex data structures
* Support for various data types including lists, dictionaries, and custom
  objects

The library uses Graphviz to create clear, graphical representations that make
it easier to understand how Python manages memory and references.
