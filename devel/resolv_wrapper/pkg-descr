resolv_wrapper makes it possible on most UNIX platforms to contact your own DNS
implementation in your test environment. It requires socket_wrapper to be able
to contact it.
If it doesn't work on a special platform the wrapper is able to fake DNS queries
and return valid responses to your application.

- Redirects name queries to the nameservers specified in your resolv.conf
- Can fake DNS queries using a simple formatted DNS hosts file.
