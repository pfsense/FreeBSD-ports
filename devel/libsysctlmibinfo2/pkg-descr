The sysctlmibinfo2 library provides an API to explore the sysctl
MIB-Tree and to get the properties of an object, therefore it is
useful to handle an object correctly and to build a sysctl-like
utility.

It implements wrappers around the sysctlinfo(4) interface and
sysctlbyname_improved to provide a more easy interface, moreover
it defines a 'struct sysctlmif_object' and provides a convenient
API to build data structures of sysctlmif_object.
