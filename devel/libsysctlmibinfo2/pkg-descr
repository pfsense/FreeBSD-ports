The sysctlmibinfo2 library provides an API to explore the sysctl MIB and
to get the info of an object, it depends on the sysctlinfo interface and
sysctlbyname-improved.

This library provides:

 * an API to wrap the internal sysctl nodes of sysctlinfo and
   sysctlbyname-improved
 * a handy userland MIB object representation
 * functions to build object-list and object-tree

The advantages to use sysctlmibinfo2 are:

 * an easy userspace API to the kernel sysctl MIB-Tree
 * building quickly a custom sysctl(8) tool
