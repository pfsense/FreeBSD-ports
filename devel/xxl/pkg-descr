XXL is a library for C and C++ that provides exception handling and asset
management. Asset management is integrated with the exception handling
mechanism such that assets may be automatically cleaned up if an exception
is thrown, which allows for much simplified program structure with respect
to error handling.

By allowing XXL to track assets and using its exception handling features,
the programmer no longer has to check error conditions on every function
call and cleanup the assets on failure because XXL does the work.
