Term::Visual is a "visual" terminal interface for curses applications. It
provides the split-screen interface you may have seen in console based IRC
and MUD clients.

Term::Visual uses the POE networking and multitasking framework to support
concurrent input from network sockets and the console, multiple timers, and
more.
