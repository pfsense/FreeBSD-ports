A small library for keeping your version up-to-date easily & everywhere.

The pain of having to update your setup.py, your Sphinx conf.py, your
__init__.py & everything else on every release of your Python package sucks.

By putting your version number in a top-level VERSION file & using this
library, you can cut duplication & tedious manual work without having to lean
on crazy import hacks.

Inspired by crazy discussion with George Hickman (ghickman) at PyCon 2013.
