Buildkite-agent is a small, reliable, and cross-platform build runner that
makes it easy to run automated builds on your own infrastructure. Its main
responsibilities are polling buildkite.com for work, running build jobs,
reporting back the status code and output log of the job, and uploading the
job's artifacts.
