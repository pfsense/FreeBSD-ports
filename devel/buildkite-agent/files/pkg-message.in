buildkite-agent requires minimal configuration in rc.conf, to allow hiding the
the agent token from casual prying eyes, and to specify the user account to run
the agent under, as its home directory is needed for ssh keys and agents, source
code repositories, and temporary build worksapces.

The %%PREFIX%%/rc.conf.d/buildkite file should be protected via
owner/group root:wheel and 0600 permissions, to ensure the API token is
not left exposed to non-privileged users and to any processes the agent
itself may launch.

Note: the supplied user must have full filesystems permissions over its homedir.

# %%PREFIX%%/rc.conf.d/buildkite
# mandatory parameters
buildkite_enable=YES
buildkite_token=abc123456def
buildkite_account=sudo_make_me_a_user
# optional parameters
buildkite_config=%%ETCDIR%%/buildkite-agent.cfg
buildkite_vars="KEY=value MORE=values"

See https://buildkite.com/docs/agent for further details.
