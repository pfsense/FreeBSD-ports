The PAR Toolkit is a cross between Java's JAR and Perl2EXE; It makes
cross-platform packaging and deployment a breeze for Perl programmers.

Notable features include:

* Turn your Perl programs into ready-to-run executables
* Pack scripts and required libraries with a binary loader
* Put PAR files into @INC to avoid version conflicts
* Works with remote URL as well as local files
* Supports XS modules and DATA sections
* Turns CPAN module distributions into PAR distributions
* Install, uninstall, signs and verifies PAR distributions
* Runs scripts inside PAR files, generated by "pp -p"
