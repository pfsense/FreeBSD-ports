    PR gdb/30214: Prefer local include paths to system include paths
    
    Some systems may install binutils headers into a system location
    (e.g. /usr/local/include on FreeBSD) which may also include headers
    for other external packages used by GDB such as zlib or zstd.  If a
    system include path such as /usr/local/include is added before local
    include paths to directories within a clone or release tarball, then
    headers from the external binutils package are used which can result
    in build failures if the external binutils package is out of sync with
    the version of GDB being built.
    
    To fix, sort the include paths in INTERNAL_CFLAGS_BASE to add CFLAGS
    for "local" componenets before external components.
