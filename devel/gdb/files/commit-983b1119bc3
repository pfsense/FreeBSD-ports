commit 1371da3a2d71dbd58f5ba3dd3c39841f0182556d
Author: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>

    fbsd-nat: Add a low_delete_thread virtual method.
    
    This method can be overridden by architecture-specific targets to
    perform additional work when a thread is deleted.
    
    Note that this method is only invoked on systems supporting LWP
    events, but the pending use case (aarch64 debug registers) is not
    supported on older kernels that do not support LWP events.
    
    (cherry picked from commit 983b1119bc315c9182e3aba898ca8099e54da49e)
