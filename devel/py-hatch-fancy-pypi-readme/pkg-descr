hatch-fancy-pypi-readme is a Hatch metadata plugin for everyone who cares about
the first impression of their project's PyPI landing page. It allows you to
define your PyPI project description in terms of concatenated fragments that are
based on static strings, files, and most importantly: parts of files defined
using cut-off points or regular expressions.

Once you've assembled your readme, you can additionally run regular
expression-based substitutions over it. For instance to make relative links
absolute or to linkify users and issue numbers in your changelog.
