setoptconf is a Python library that can be used to retrieve program settings
from a variety of common sources:
- Command Line
- Environment Variables
- INI Files
- JSON Files
- YAML Files
- Python Objects/Modules

The goal of this project is to define your desired settings in a simple and
consistent way, and then point setoptconf at as many of the sources as you'd
like to use, and let it comb them all, looking for your settings.
