Many find Bugzilla's web-based UI inefficient.  PyBugz is a command-line based
interface that was written by Alastair Tse in order to improve his interaction
with Gentoo Bugzilla

Features
--------
* Searching bugzilla
* Listing details of a bug including comments and attachments
* Downloading/viewing attachments from bugzilla
* Posting bugs, comments, and making changes to an existing bug.
* Adding attachments to a bug.

There is extensive help in `bugz --help` and `bugz <subcommand>
--help` for additional options.
