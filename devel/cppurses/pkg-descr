CPPurses is a Terminal User Interface(TUI) Library built on top of ncurses.
It defines a framework of Widgets, Layouts, and Events that let you focus on
user interface design, while boilerplate common to ncurses applications is
handled behind the scenes.

CPPurses contains a collection of common Widgets that can be pieced together to
create a composite application. It is also possible to expand and build on top
of existing Widgets, or to create completely new Widget types, by overriding a
few virtual functions.
