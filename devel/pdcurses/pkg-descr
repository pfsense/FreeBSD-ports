PDCurses is a public domain curses library for Win32, DOS, OS/2 and X11,
implementing most of the functions available in System V R4 curses. It
supports most compilers for these platforms. The X11 port allows existing
text-mode curses programs to be re-compiled and linked with PDCurses to
produce native X11 applications.
