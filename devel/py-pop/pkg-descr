Pop is used to express the Plugin Oriented Programming Paradigm. The Plugin
Oriented Programming Paradigm has been designed to make pluggable software
easy to write and easy to extend.

Plugin Oriented Programming presents a new way to scale development teams
and deliver complex software. This is done by making the applications entirely
out of plugins, and also making the applications themselves natively pluggable
with each other.

Using Plugin Oriented Programming it then becomes easy to have the best of both
worlds, software can be build in small pieces, making development easier to
maintain. But the small pieces can then be merged and deployed in a single
binary, making code deployment easy as well.
