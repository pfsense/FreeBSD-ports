Importlab is a library for Python that automatically infers dependencies and
calculates a dependency graph. It can perform dependency ordering of a set of
files, including cycle detection.

Importlab's main use case is to work with static analysis tools that process one
file at a time, ensuring that a file's dependencies are analysed before it is.

Importlab is primarily intended to be used as a library. It takes one or more
python files as arguments, and generates an import graph, typically used to
process files in dependency order.
