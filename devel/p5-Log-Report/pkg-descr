Handling messages to users can be a hassle, certainly when the same module is
used for command-line and in a graphical interfaces, and has to cope with
internationalization at the same time; this set of modules tries to simplify
this. Log::Report combines gettext features with Log::Dispatch-like features.
However, you can also use this module to do only translations or only message
dispatching.
