cargo-dist solves the problem of curring releases and distributing them.

Cutting releases of your apps and distributing binaries for them has a lot of
steps, and cargo-dist is quickly growing to try to cover them all.

To accomplish this, dist functionality can be broken up into two parts:
* building (planning the release; building binaries and installers)
* distributing (**hosting** artifacts; publishing packages; announcing releases)

The build functionality can be used on its own if you just want some tarballs
and installers, but everything really comes together when you use the
distribution functionality too.
