Heaptrack traces all memory allocations and annotates these events with stack
traces. Dedicated analysis tools then allow you to interpret the heap memory
profile to:

  *  find hotspots that need to be optimized to reduce the memory footprint of
     your application
  *  find memory leaks, i.e. locations that allocate memory which is never
     deallocated
  *  find allocation hotspots, i.e. code locations that trigger a lot of
     memory allocation calls
  *  find temporary allocations, which are allocations that are directly
     followed by their deallocation
