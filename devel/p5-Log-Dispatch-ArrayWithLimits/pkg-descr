Log::Dispatch::ArrayWithLimits functions similarly to Log::Dispatch::Array, with
a few differences:
- only the messages (strings) are stored
- allow specifying array variable name (e.g. "My::array" instead of \@My:array)
  This makes it possible to use in Log::Log4perl configuration, which is a text
  file.
- can apply some limits
  Currently only max_elems (the maximum number of elements in the array) is
  available. Future limits will be added (see "TODO").

Logging to an in-process array can be useful when debugging/testing, or when you
want to let users of your program connect to your program to request viewing the
ogs being produced.
