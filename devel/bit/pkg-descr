bit is an experimental modernized git CLI built on top of git that
provides happy defaults and other niceties:

 - command and flag suggestions to help you navigate the plethora of
   options git provides you
 - autocompletion for files and branch names when using bit add or bit
   checkout
 - automatic fetch and branch fast-forwarding reducing the likelihood
   of merge conflicts
 - suggestions work with git aliases
 - new commands like bit sync that vastly simplify your workflow
 - commands from git-extras such as bit release & bit info
 - fully compatible with git allowing you to fallback to git if need be
 - update using bit update
 - get insight into how bit works using bit --debug
