DParser is a simple but powerful tool for parsing. You can specify the form of
the text to be parsed using a combination of regular expressions and grammar
productions. Because of the parsing technique (technically a scannerless GLR
parser based on the Tomita algorithm) there are no restrictions. The grammar
can be ambiguous, right or left recursive, have any number of null productions,
and because there is no separate tokenizer, can include whitespace in terminals
and have terminals which are prefixes of other terminals. DParser handles not
just well formed computer languages and data files, but just about any wacky
situation that occurs in the real world.
