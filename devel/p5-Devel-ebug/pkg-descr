A debugger is a computer program that is used to debug other programs.
Devel::ebug is a simple, extensible Perl debugger with a clean API.
Using this module, you may easily write a Perl debugger to debug your
programs. Alternatively, it comes with an interactive debugger, ebug.

perl5db.pl, Perl's current debugger is currently 2,600 lines of magic
and special cases. The code is nearly unreadable: fixing bugs and
adding new features is fraught with difficulties. The debugger has no
test suite which has caused breakage with changes that couldn't be
properly tested. It will also not debug regexes. Devel::ebug is aimed
at fixing these problems and delivering a replacement debugger which
provides a well-tested simple programmatic interface to debugging
programs. This makes it easier to build debuggers on top of
Devel::ebug, be they console-, curses-, GUI- or Ajax-based.

There are currently two user interfaces to Devel::debug, ebug and
ebug_http. ebug is a console-based interface to debugging programs,
much like perl5db.pl. ebug_http is an innovative web-based interface
to debugging programs.
