Class::Accessor is a great way to automate the tedious task of
generating accessors and mutators. One small drawback is that due to
the details of the implementation, you only get one __ANON__ entry in
profiling output. That entry contains all your accessors, which can be
a real pain if you're attempting to figure out which of your accessors
is being called six billion times. This module is a development aid
which uses Hook::LexWrap and Sub::Name to talk your accessors into
identifying themselves. While it shouldn't add much additional runtime
overhead (as it acts only Class::Accessor's generator functions), it
has not been designed for production deployment.
