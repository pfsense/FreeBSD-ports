This is a sister module of Parse::PMFile.  This module parses local
.pm files (and a META file if any) in a specific (current if not
specified) directory, and returns a hash reference that represents
"provides" information (with some extra meta data).  This is almost
the same as Module::Metadata does (which has been in Perl core since
Perl 5.13.9).  The main difference is the most of the code of this
module is directly taken from the PAUSE code as of June 2013.  If you
need better compatibility to PAUSE, try this.  If you need better
performance, safety, or portability in general, Module::Metadata may
be a better and handier option (Parse::PMFile (and thus
Parse::LocalDistribution) actually evaluates code in the $VERSION line
(in a Safe compartment), which may be problematic in some cases).
