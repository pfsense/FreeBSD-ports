The routines pragma is used to provide typeable method and function signtures to
the calling package, as well as before, after, around, augment and override
method modifiers.

The registry pragma is used to associate the calling package with Type::Tiny
type libraries. A $registry variable is made available to the caller to be used
to access registry objects. The variable is a callback (i.e. coderef) which
should be called with a single argument, the namespace whose registry object you
want, otherwise the argument defaults to main.
