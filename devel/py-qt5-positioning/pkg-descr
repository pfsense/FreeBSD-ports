PyQt5 is a set of Python bindings for Qt5 application framework.
This package provides the QtPositioning module.

The QtPositioning module contains classes to determine a position by
using a variety of possible sources, including satellite, or wifi, or
a text file, and so on. That information can then be used to, for
example, determine a position on a map. In addition satellite
information can be retrieved and area based monitoring can be performed.
