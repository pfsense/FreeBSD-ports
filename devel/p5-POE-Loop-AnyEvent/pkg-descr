POE::Loop::AnyEvent replaces POE's default select() event loop with AnyEvent.
This allows POE programs to transparently use most of the event loops AnyEvent
can provide.

POE::Loop::AnyEvent changes POE's internal implementation without altering its
APIs. By design, nearly all software that are already uses POE should continue
to work normally without any changes.
