PyCharm is an advanced IDE developed by JetBrains and focused on
developer productivity. PyCharm provides smart code completion, code
inspections, on-the-fly error highlighting and quick-fixes, along with
automated code refactorings and rich navigation capabilities.

PyCharm is now one unified product. All users now automatically start
with a free one-month Pro trial. After that, you can subscribe to Pro
or keep using the core features for free - now with Jupyter support
included.

PyCharm Professional users are unaffected and will continue to enjoy
full access to all Pro features in the unified product.
