xsData is a complete data binding library for python allowing developers to
access and use XML and JSON documents as simple objects rather than using DOM.

The code generator supports XML schemas, DTD, WSDL definitions, XML & JSON
documents. It produces simple dataclasses with type hints and simple binding
metadata.

The included XML and JSON parser/serializer are highly optimized and adaptable,
with multiple handlers and configuration properties.

xsData is constantly tested against the W3C XML Schema 1.1 test suite.
