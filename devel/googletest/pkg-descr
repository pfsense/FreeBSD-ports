GoogleTest is based on the xUnit architecture. Supports automatic test
discovery, a rich set of assertions, user-defined assertions, death
tests, fatal and non-fatal failures, type-parameterized tests, various
options for running the tests, and XML test report generation.

GoogleMock is inspired by jMock, EasyMock, and Hamcrest, and designed
with C++'s specifics in mind, Google C++ Mocking Framework (or Google
Mock for short) is a library for writing and using C++ mock
classes. Google Mock:

    * lets you create mock classes trivially using simple macros,
    * supports a rich set of matchers and actions,
    * handles unordered, partially ordered, or completely ordered expectations,
    * is extensible by users, and
    * works on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
