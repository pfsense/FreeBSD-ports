Polyglot provides a registry of file types that can be loaded by
calling its improved version of 'require'. Each file extension
that can be handled by a custom loader is registered by calling
Polyglot.register('ext', <class>), and then you can simply
require 'somefile', which will find and load 'somefile.ext'
using your custom loader.

This supports the creation of DSLs having a syntax that is most
appropriate to their purpose, instead of abusing the Ruby syntax.

Required files are attempted first using the normal Ruby loader,
and if that fails, Polyglot conducts a search for a file having
a supported extension.
