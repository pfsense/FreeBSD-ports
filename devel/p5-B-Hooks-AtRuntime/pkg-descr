B::Hooks::AtRuntime allows code that runs at compile-time to do something at
runtime. A block passed to at_runtime gets compiled into the code that's
currently compiling, and will be called when control reaches that point at
runtime. In the example in the SYNOPSIS, the warnings will occur in order, and
if that section of code runs more than once, so will all three warnings.
