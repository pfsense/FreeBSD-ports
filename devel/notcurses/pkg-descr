notcurses is a library for building complex, vibrant textual user interfaces
(TUIs) on modern terminal emulators. It does not use Ncurses (though it does
make use of libtinfo from that package), nor is it an X/Open Curses
source-compatible replacement. It is written in C, with C++-safe headers.
Rust, C++, and Python wrappers are available.
