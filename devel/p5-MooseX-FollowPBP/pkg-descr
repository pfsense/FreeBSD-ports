This module does not provide any methods. Simply loading it changes the
default naming policy for the loading class so that accessors are
separated into get and set methods. The get methods are prefixed with
"get_" as the accessor, while set methods are prefixed with "set_".
This is the naming style recommended by Damian Conway in Perl Best
Practices.
