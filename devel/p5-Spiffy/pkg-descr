Spiffy is a framework and methodology for doing object oriented
programming in Perl. Spiffy combines the best parts of Exporter.pm,
base.pm, mixin.pm and SUPER.pm into one magic foundation class. It
attempts to fix all the nits and warts of traditional Perl OO, in a
clean, straightforward and (perhaps someday) standard way.
