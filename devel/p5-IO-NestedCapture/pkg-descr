With this module you can capture any combination of STDIN, STDOUT, and
STDERR. In the case of STDIN, you may feed any input into capture you
want (or even set it to use another file handle). For STDOUT and STDERR
you may review the full output of these or prior to capture set a file
handle that will receive all the data during the capture.
