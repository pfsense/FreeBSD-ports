Class::Method::Modifiers::Fast provides three modifiers: before,
around, and after.  before and after are run just before and after the
method they modify, but cannot really affect that original method.
around is run in place of the original method, with a hook to easily
call that original method. See the MODIFIERS section for more details
on how the particular modifiers work.
