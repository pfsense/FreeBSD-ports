dot.conf is a simple configuration-file parser library written in C.
The configuration files created for dot.conf look very similar to
those used by the Apache Webserver. Even Container-Directives known
from httpd.conf can easily be used in the exact same manner as for
Apache-Modules. It supports various types of arguments, dynamically
loadable modules that create their own configuration options
on-the-fly, a here-documents feature to pass very long ARG_STR data
to your app, ${NAME:-default} style environment variable
substitution for arguments, and on-the-fly inclusion of additional
config files. Some behaviour can be toggled with flags at runtime.
To keep dotconf from printing out warnings, you can install your
own customized error handler.
