It is rare, but there are times where you want to swap out the currently
compiling file for a different one. This module does that. From the point you
use the module perl will be parsing the new file instead of the original.

This was created specifically for Test2::Harness which can preload modules and
fork to run each test. The problem was that using do to execute the test files
post-fork was resuling in extra frames in the stack trace... in other words
there are a lot of tests that assume the test file is the bottom of the stack.
This happens all the time, specially if stack traces need to be verified.

This module allows Test2::Harness to swap out the main script for the new file
without adding a stack frame.
