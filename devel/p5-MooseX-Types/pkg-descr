The types provided with Moose are by design global. This package helps you to
organise and selectively import your own and the built-in types in libraries.
As a nice side effect, it catches typos at compile-time too.

However, the main reason for this module is to provide an easy way to not have
conflicts with your type names, since the internal fully qualified names of the
 types will be prefixed with the library's name.

This module will also provide you with some helper functions to make it easier
to use Moose types in your code.
