This is the C implementation of the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). It provides
the official Protocol Buffers definitions and code for working with traces,
metrics, and logs across the OpenTelemetry ecosystem.

Use this if you need native C support for OTLP, or to integrate OpenTelemetry
data into your own collectors, exporters, or backend services.
