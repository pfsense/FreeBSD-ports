This binary is intended as an easier way to include C code in your Go program.

This binary can be installed and Go can be told to use this binary when it
invokes pkg-config. If it finds a library that is known by the program,
it will compile and output the location for that binary. If it doesn't know
what the program is, it will default to invoking the system pkg-config to
obtain the compilation flags.
