The Qt SCXML module provides functionality to create state machines from SCXML
files. This includes both dynamically creating state machines (loading the
SCXML file and instantiating states and transitions) and generating a C++ file
that has a class implementing the state machine. It also contains functionality
to support data models and executable content.
