This module provides a framework to produce sprite animations using
ASCII art. Each ASCII 'sprite' is given one or more frames, and placed
into the animation as an 'animation object'. An animation object can
have a callback routine that controls the position and frame of the
object.

If the constructor is passed no arguments, it assumes that it is
running full screen, and behaves accordingly. Alternatively, it can
accept a curses window (created with the Curses newwin call) as an
argument, and will draw into that window.
