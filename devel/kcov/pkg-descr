Kcov is a FreeBSD/Linux/OSX code coverage tester for compiled languages, Python
and Bash. Kcov was originally a fork of Bcov, but has since evolved to support
a large feature set in addition to that of Bcov.

Kcov, like Bcov, uses DWARF debugging information for compiled programs to make
it possible to collect coverage information without special compiler switches.
