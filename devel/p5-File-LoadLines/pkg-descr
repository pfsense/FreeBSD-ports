File::LoadLines provides an easy way to load the contents of a text file into an
array of lines. It is intended for relatively small files like config files that
are often produced by weird tools (and users).

It automatically handles ASCII, Latin-1 and UTF-8 text. When the file has a BOM,
it handles UTF-8, UTF-16 LE and BE, and UTF-32 LE and BE.

Recognized line terminators are NL (Unix, Linux), CRLF (DOS, Windows) and CR
(Mac)
