A backwards/forwards-compatible fork of distutils.version.LooseVersion, for
times when PEP-440 isn't what you need.

The goal of this package is to be a drop-in replacement for the original
LooseVersion. It implements an identical interface and comparison logic to
LooseVersion. The only major change is that a looseversion.LooseVersion is
comparable to a distutils.version.LooseVersion, which means tools should not
need to worry whether all dependencies that use LooseVersion have migrated.
