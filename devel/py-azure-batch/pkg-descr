This is the Microsoft Azure Batch Client Library.

Batch processing began with mainframe computers and punch cards. Today, it
still plays a central role in business, engineering, science, and other
areas that require running lots of automated tasks-processing bills and
payroll, calculating portfolio risk, designing new products, rendering
animated films, testing software, searching for energy, predicting the
weather, and finding new cures for disease.  Previously, few people had
access to the computing power for these scenarios.  With Azure Batch, that
power is available to you when you need it, without any capital investment.
