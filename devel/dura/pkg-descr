Dura is a background process that watches your Git repositories and commits
your uncommitted changes without impacting HEAD, the current branch, or the
Git index (staged files). If you ever get into an "oh snap!" situation where
you think you just lost days of work, checkout a `dura` branch and recover.

Without `dura`, you use Ctrl-Z in your editor to get back to a good state.
That's so 2021. Computers crash and Ctrl-Z only works on files independently.
Dura snapshots changes across the entire repository as-you-go, so you can
revert to "4 hours ago" instead of "hit Ctrl-Z like 40 times or whatever".
