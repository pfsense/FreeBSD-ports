A C++11 (or later) header-only toml parser/encoder depending only on C++
standard library.

It is compatible to the latest version of TOML v1.0.0-rc.2, and one of
the most TOML-standard compliant libraries, with great error messages,
configurable serializer and user-defined type conversions, with full
UTF-8 support.
