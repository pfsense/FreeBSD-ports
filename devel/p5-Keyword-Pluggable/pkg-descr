Keyword::Pluggable lets you implement new keywords in pure Perl. To do this, you
need to write a module and call Keyword::Pluggable::define in your import
method. Any keywords defined this way will be available in the scope that's
currently being compiled. The scope can be lexical, packaged, and global.
