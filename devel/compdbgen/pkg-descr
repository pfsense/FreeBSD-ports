compdbgen is a general-purpose tool for generating compile_commands.json
files, used with clangd's lsp-server.  The tool uses ptrace to intercept
system calls for the current task and all its child tasks, capture the
arguments and environment variables of the execve system call, and
generate compile_commands.json files.
