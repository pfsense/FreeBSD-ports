Module::CheckDeps parses Perl code searching for used modules. It can either
return a list of all the modules used by some code, or a list of the used
modules that are not available in the host system (e.g. not installed modules).

Compared to similar modules, such as Module::ScanDeps, Module::CheckDeps is
simpler and less powerful, but also much faster.
