Marrow Utilities Collection

This package contains many commonly reimplemented utility classes and functions
covering the following major areas:
 - attribute, partial/subset, case-insensitive, and multi-value dicts
 - py3k source compatibility (without using 2to3)
 - string to rich datatype conversion of bools, simple arrays, and complex
   keyword/tag parsing
 - rich OOP helpers: nested list flattening, a NoDefault implementation,
   dot-notation object loading, and a LRU cache
 - path manipulation
 - UTC, universal time constants, english to numerical month and DotW
   conversion, and date field range constants
