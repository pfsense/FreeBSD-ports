Converts between Gregorian dates and other calendar systems. Calendars include:

* Baha'i
* French Republican
* Hebrew
* Indian Civil
* Islamic
* ISO
* Julian
* Mayan

The holidays module also provides some useful holiday-calculation, with a focus
on North American and Jewish holidays. Note that in some calendar systems, the
day begins at sundown. Convertdate uses noon of the day in question.
