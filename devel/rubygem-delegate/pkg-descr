This library provides three different ways to delegate method calls to an
object. The easiest to use is SimpleDelegator. Pass an object to the constructor
and all methods supported by the object will be delegated. This object can be
changed later.

Going a step further, the top level DelegateClass method allows you to easily
setup delegation through class inheritance. This is considerably more flexible
and thus probably the most common use for this library.

Finally, if you need full control over the delegation scheme, you can inherit
from the abstract class Delegator and customize as needed. (If you find yourself
needing this control, have a look at Forwardable which is also in the standard
library. It may suit your needs better.)
