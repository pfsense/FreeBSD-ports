This package provides a handful of functions you can use to print debugging
information. There are basically two things that are useful about these
functions. First, they're only one or two letters each, so you can type
them really quickly while debugging. Second, they append the name of the
calling function to whatever you're printing, so you can easily see where
each message came from (and you don't have to hunt down print statements
once you finish debugging).
