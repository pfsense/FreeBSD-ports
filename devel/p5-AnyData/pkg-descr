The rather wacky idea behind this module and its sister module DBD::AnyData
is that any data, regardless of source or format should be accessible and
modifiable with the same simple set of methods. This module provides a multi-
dimensional tied hash interface to data in a dozen different formats. The
DBD::AnyData module adds a DBI/SQL interface for those same formats.

Both modules provide built-in protections including appropriate flocking()
for all I/O and (in most cases) record-at-a-time access to files rather than
slurping of entire files.

Currently supported formats include general format flat files (CSV, Fixed
Length, etc.), specific formats (passwd files, httpd logs, etc.), and a
variety of other kinds of formats (XML, Mp3, HTML tables). The number of
supported formats will continue to grow rapidly since there is an open API
making it easy for any author to create additional format parsers which can
be plugged in to AnyData itself and thereby be accessible by either the
tiedhash or DBI/SQL interface.
