The GNU Autoconf Archive is a collection of more than 500 macros for GNU
Autoconf that have been contributed as free software by friendly supporters of
the cause from all over the Internet. Every single one of those macros can be
re-used without imposing any restrictions whatsoever on the licensing of the
generated configure script. In particular, it is possible to use all those
macros in configure scripts that are meant for non-free software. This policy is
unusual for a Free Software Foundation project. The FSF firmly believes that
software ought to be free, and software licenses like the GPL are specifically
designed to ensure that derivative work based on free software must be free as
well. In case of Autoconf, however, an exception has been made, because Autoconf
is at such a pivotal position in the software development tool chain that the
benefits from having this tool available as widely as possible outweigh the
disadvantage that some authors may choose to use it, too, for proprietary
software.
