get-reader provides a get_reader() function that returns reader objects similar
to those returned by csv.reader(). This package:
- reduces common boilerplate code for handling files and reading records.
- reads data from CSV, pandas, SQL connections, MS Excel, DBF, and squint.
- provides a single interface across Python versions (including seamless
  Unicode-aware CSV support for Python 2).
- is easy to incorporate into your own projects.
