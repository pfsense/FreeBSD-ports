LPeg is a new pattern-matching library for Lua, based on Parsing Expression
Grammars (PEGs).

Following the Snobol tradition, LPeg defines patterns as first-class objects.
That is, patterns are regular Lua values (represented by userdata). The library
offers several functions to create and compose patterns. With the use of
metamethods, several of these functions are provided as infix or prefix
operators. On the one hand, the result is usually much more verbose than the
typical encoding of patterns using the so called regular expressions (which
typically are not regular expressions in the formal sense). On the other hand,
first-class patterns allow much better documentation (as it is easy to comment
the code, to break complex definitions in smaller parts, etc.) and are
extensible, as we can define new functions to create and compose patterns.
