CHI provides a unified caching API, designed to assist a developer in
persisting data for a specified period of time.

The CHI interface is implemented by driver classes that support
fetching, storing and clearing of data. Driver classes exist or will
exist for the gamut of storage backends available to Perl, such as
memory, plain files, memory mapped files, memcached, and DBI.

CHI is intended as an evolution of DeWitt Clinton's Cache::Cache
package, adhering to the basic Cache API but adding new features and
addressing limitations in the Cache::Cache implementation.
