File-HStore is a very minimalist perl library to store files on a
filesystem using a very simple hash-based storage.

File-HStore is nothing more than a simple wrapper interface to a
storage containing a specific directory structure where files are hold
based on their hashes. The name of the directories is based on the
first two bytes of the hexadecimal form of the digest. The file is
stored and named with its full hexadecimal form in the corresponding
prefixed directory.

The current version is supporting the SHA-1 and SHA-2 (256 bits)
algorithm. The FAT (Free Archive Toolkit) format is also supported and
it is composed of the date of submission plus the SHA-2 real digest
part.
