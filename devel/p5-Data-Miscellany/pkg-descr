This is a collection of miscellaneous subroutines useful in wide but varying
scenarios; a catch-all module for things that don't obviously belong anywhere
else. Obviously what's useful differs from person to person, but this particular
collection should be useful in object-oriented frameworks, such as
Class::Scaffold and Data::Conveyor.
