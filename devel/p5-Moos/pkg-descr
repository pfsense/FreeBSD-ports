Moos completes the M to Moose sequence of Perl OO modules.

This one is pure Perl, single file and mostly Moose compatible (for what it
does). Moos has no non-core dependencies, but certain features (roles, debugging
functions, legacy Perl support) do require additional modules. If you steer away
from those features, you don't need those additional modules.
