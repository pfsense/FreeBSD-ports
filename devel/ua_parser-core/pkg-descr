This port contains the core of BrowserScope's original user agent string
parser: data collected over the years by Steve Souders and numerous other
contributors, extracted into a separate YAML file so as to be reusable as is
by implementations in any programming language.

This port itself does not contain a parser: only the necessary data to build
one.  There exists a ref implementation, along with multiple, production-ready
implementations in various programming languages.
