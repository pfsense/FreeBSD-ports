TinyGo is a project to bring the Go programming language to microcontrollers
and modern web browsers by creating a new compiler based on LLVM.  You can
compile and run TinyGo programs on several different microcontroller boards
such as the BBC micro:bit and the Arduino Uno.  TinyGo can also be used to
produce WebAssembly (WASM) code which is very compact in size.
