Avocado is a set of tools and libraries to help with automated testing.

One can call it a test framework with benefits. Native tests are written in
Python and they follow the unittest pattern, but any executable can serve
as a test.

Avocado is composed of:

 - A test runner that lets you execute tests. Those tests can be either written
   in your language of choice, or be written in Python and use the available
   libraries. In both cases, you get facilities such as automated log
   and system information collection.

 - Libraries that help you write tests in a concise, yet expressive
   and powerful way.

 - Plugins that can extend and add new functionality to the Avocado Framework.

Avocado is built on the experience accumulated with Autotest, while improving
on its weaknesses and shortcomings.
