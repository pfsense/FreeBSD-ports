UltraGetopt is a versatile and customizable implementation of getopt() with
support for many common extensions, MS-DOS formatted option strings, and much
more.  It can function as a drop-in replacement for getopt() on systems with or
without existing vendor-provided implementations and also as a separate
co-existing function.
