Small library that offers basic data structures (list, set, map...)
in a pure C API for user-space applications. Key features:

- Easy to use, portable
- No "magic" MACROs, and no need to modify your data structures
  (except, perhaps, for __attribute__((packed)))
- Stable and well-tested backend engine (libstdc++) for most of
  the data structures
- Reasonable performance - comparable to libstdc++
