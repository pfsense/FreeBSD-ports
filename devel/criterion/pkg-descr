Criterion is a cross-platform C and C++ unit testing framework for the
21st century.

Most test frameworks for C require a lot of boilerplate code to set up
tests and test suites -- you need to create a main, then register new
test suites, then register the tests within these suites, and finally
call the right functions.

This gives the user great control, at the unfortunate cost of
simplicity.

Criterion follows the KISS principle, while keeping the control the
user would have with other frameworks.
