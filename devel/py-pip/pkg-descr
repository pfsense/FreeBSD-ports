The PyPA recommended tool for installing and managing Python packages.

pip is a replacement for easy_install. It uses mostly the same techniques
for finding packages, so packages that were made easy_installable should
be pip-installable as well.

pip is meant to improve on easy_install. Some of the improvements:

    * All packages are downloaded before installation. Partially-completed
      installation doesn't occur as a result.
    * Care is taken to present useful output on the console.
    * The reasons for actions are kept track of. For instance, if a package
      is being installed, pip keeps track of why that package was required.
    * Error messages should be useful.
    * Packages don't have to be installed as egg archives, they can be
      installed flat (while keeping the egg metadata).
