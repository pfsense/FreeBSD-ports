ObjFW is a highly portable, lightweight, general purpose, open source
Objective-C framework with full Objective-C 2.0, blocks and ARC support,
providing not only basic classes like strings, arrays and dictionaries,
but also providing abstractions for OS-dependant functionality like
asynchronous sockets.

While a lot of the core API is similar to Foundation, it breaks with
Foundation's API on purpose in many places to embrace new features which
Foundation can't use completely due to its backwards compatibility. One
such example are exceptions, which are a first class citizen in ObjFW
and not merely to inform the programmer of his wrongdoings like in
Foundation.

ObjFW runs on a huge list of platforms and offers the same API on all of
them so that software written using ObjFW runs on all platforms
supported by ObjFW without #ifdef hells or the like. It does not only
run on almost any POSIX system that supports GCC >= 4, but it also works
on Windows and niche platforms like the PlayStation Portable.
