*Faker* is a Python package that generates fake data for you. Whether
you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML
documents, fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize
data taken from a production service, Faker is for you.

Faker is heavily inspired by PHP's [Faker][php-faker], Perl's
[Data::Faker][perl-faker], and by ruby's [Faker][ruby-faker].
