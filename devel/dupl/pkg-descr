dupl is a tool written in Go for finding code clones. So far it can find clones
only in the Go source files. The method uses suffix tree for serialized ASTs. It
ignores values of AST nodes. It just operates with their types (e.g.
if a == 13 {} and if x == 100 {} are considered the same provided it exceeds the
minimal token sequence size).

Due to the used method dupl can report so called "false positives" on the
output.  These are the ones we do not consider clones (whether they are too
small, or the values of the matched tokens are completely different).
