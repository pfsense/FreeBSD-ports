openstacksdk is a client library for building applications to work with
OpenStack clouds. The project aims to provide a consistent and complete set of
interactions with OpenStack's many services, along with complete documentation,
examples, and tools.

It also contains an abstraction interface layer. Clouds can do many things, but
there are probably only about 10 of them that most people care about with any
regularity. If you want to do complicated things, the per-service oriented
portions of the SDK are for you. However, if what you want is to be able to
write an application that talks to clouds no matter what crazy choices the
deployer has made in an attempt to be more hipster than their self-entitled
narcissist peers, then the Cloud Abstraction layer is for you.
