This module acts as glue between IO::All and LWP, so that files can be read and
written through the network using the convenient IO:All interface. Note that
this module is not used directly: you just use IO::All, which knows when to
autoload IO::All::HTTP, IO::All::HTTPS, IO::All::FTP, or IO::All::Gopher, which
implement the specific protocols based on IO::All::LWP.
