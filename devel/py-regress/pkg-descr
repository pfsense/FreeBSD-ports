regress is a backtracking regular expression engine implemented in Rust, which
targets JavaScript regular expression syntax.

It's fast, Unicode-aware, has few dependencies, and has a big test suite. It
makes fewer guarantees than the regex crate but it enables more syntactic
features, such as backreferences and lookaround assertions.
