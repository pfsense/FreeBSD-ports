perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of perl in an
easy way. It provides multiple isolated perl environments, and a mechanism for
you to switch between them.

Everything are installed unter ~/perl5/perlbrew. You then need to include a
bashrc/cshrc provided by perlbrew to tweak the PATH for you. You then can
benefit from not having to run 'sudo' commands to install cpan modules because
those are installed inside your HOME too.

For the documentation of perlbrew usage see perlbrew command on CPAN, or by
running perlbrew help. The following documentation features the API of
App::perlbrew module, and may not be remotely close to what your want to read.
