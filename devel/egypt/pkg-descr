Egypt is a simple tool for creating call graphs of C programs. Egypt
neither analyzes source code nor lays out graphs. Instead, it leaves
the source code analysis to GCC and the graph layout to Graphviz, both
of which are better at their respective jobs than egypt itself could
ever hope to be. Egypt is simply a very small Perl script that glues
these existing tools together.
