muon is an implementation of the meson build system in c99 with minimal
dependencies.

# Non-features
* bug-for-bug compatibility with meson. In fact, muon aspires to be stricter
  than meson in cases where meson's implementation seems error prone. muon uses
  the official meson documentation as its specification.
* cli compatibility with meson. muon has different flags, subcommands, etc., and
  should not be renamed/symlinked to meson.

# Features
* muon analyze - a static analyzer for meson.build files. Capable of doing type
  inference, checking unused variables, undeclared variables, etc.
* muon fmt_unstable - a meson.build code formatter
* An interactive stepping debugger with the dbg() function.
* Fast
