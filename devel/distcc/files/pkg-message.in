WARNING: distcc[d] performs NO AUTHENTICATION at all and should
ONLY be used in trusted networks!

Distccd now requires the --allow (-a) argument when running
in daemon mode. This option restricts distcc to a specific
network, by default this port uses 127.0.0.0/8, you should
change this by specifying your own distccd_flags in
/etc/rc.conf, see the script in %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/distccd
for a template.

Additionally it is recommended that you add entries to
/etc/syslog.conf to record all distccd log messages to a file
such as /var/log/distccd.log.

Example syslog.conf entry:

!distccd
*.*					/var/log/distccd.log

The daemon runs on port 3632 by default. You can change that
value by calling distccd with the -p parameter, e.g.
`distccd -p 4711'. Do not edit the rc.d script to achieve this
instead override the value of distccd_flags in /etc/rc.conf.

Note that remote daemons currently won't work if they cannot
resolve the reverse DNS of the master machine
