cabal-plan provides a library for decoding plan.json files
as well as the simple tool cabal-plan for extracting and
pretty printing the information contained in the plan.json file.

plan.json files are generated by cabal's Nix-style local
builds and contain detailed information about the build/install
plan computed by the cabal solver.
