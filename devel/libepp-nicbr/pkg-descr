This is the LIBEPP-NICBR C++ library that partially implements the
Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), as described in the Internet
Drafts RFC3730bis to RFC3734bis and RFC3735.

RFC3731bis - EPP Domain Name Mapping - was implemented with hosts as
attributes of the Domain Object.

In order to conform to the .BR model, extensions to the EPP Domain Name
and Contact Mapping were made (draft-neves-epp-brdomain and
draft-neves-epp-brorg), supported since version 0.2. The documentation
for these extensions is available at EPP References.
