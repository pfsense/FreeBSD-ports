IPC::MMA provides an interface to Ralf Engelschall's mm library, allowing
memory to be shared between multiple processes in a relatively
convenient way.

IPC::MMA is a superset of Arthur Choung's IPC::MM module, adding arrays and
allowing any Perl scalar to be used as a hash/BTree key rather than just C
strings. IPC::MMA hashes are like IPC::MM BTrees in that they return keys in
sorted order ineach, keys, and next operations.

An IPC::MMA array can store data in any of six ways, including general-purpose
scalars, signed or unsigned integers, floating-point numbers, fixed-length
strings/records, and booleans at one bit per array element.
