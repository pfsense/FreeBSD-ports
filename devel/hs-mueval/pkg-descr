Mueval is a Haskell interpreter. It uses the GHC API to evaluate arbitrary
Haskell expressions. Importantly, mueval takes many precautions to defang
and avoid "evil" code. It uses resource limits, whitelisted modules,
special Show instances for IO, threads, processes, changes of directory,
and so on to sandbox the Haskell code. It is, in short, intended to be a
standalone version of Lambdabot's famous evaluation functionality. For
examples and explanations, please see the README file. Mueval is POSIX-only.
