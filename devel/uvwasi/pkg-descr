This project does not currently provide the comprehensive file system security
properties provided by some WASI runtimes. Full support for secure file system
sandboxing may or may not be implemented in future. In the mean time, do not
rely on it to run untrusted code.

uvwasi implements the WASI system call API, so that WebAssembly runtimes can
easily implement WASI calls. Under the hood, uvwasi leverages libuv where
possible for maximum portability.
