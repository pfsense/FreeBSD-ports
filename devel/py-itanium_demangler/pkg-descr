The Python Itanium Demangler is a pure Python parser for the Itanium C++ ABI
symbol mangling language. Note that MSVC mangling language is not supported.

This demangler generates an abstract syntax tree from mangled symbols, which
can be used for directly extracting type information, as opposed to having
to interpret the C++ source code corresponding to the demangled symbol.

There is also a built-in AST stringifier, so the demangler can be used
as a replacement for c++filt or for formatting backtraces.
