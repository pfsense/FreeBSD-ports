Generate requirements.txt file for any project based on imports.

Why not pip freeze?

  - pip freeze only saves the packages that are installed with pip install in
    your environment.
  - pip freeze saves all packages in the environment including those that you
    don't use in your current project. (if you don't have virtualenv)
  - and sometimes you just need to create requirements.txt for a new project
    without installing modules.
