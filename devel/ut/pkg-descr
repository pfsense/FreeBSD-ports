UT is a C++20 u(micro)/Unit Testing Framework.

Testing is a very important part of the Software Development, however,
C++ doesn't provide any good testing facilities out of the box, which often
leads into a poor testing experience for develops and/or lack of tests/coverage
in general.

UT attempts to provide a uniform and easy way to run tests in C++.
