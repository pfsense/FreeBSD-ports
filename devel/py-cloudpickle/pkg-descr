cloudpickle makes it possible to serialize Python constructs not supported by
the default pickle module from the Python standard library.

cloudpickle is especially useful for cluster computing where Python code is
shipped over the network to execute on remote hosts, possibly close to the data.

Among other things, cloudpickle supports pickling for lambda functions along
with functions and classes defined interactively in the __main__ module (for
instance in a script, a shell or a Jupyter notebook).

Cloudpickle can only be used to send objects between the exact same version of
Python.
