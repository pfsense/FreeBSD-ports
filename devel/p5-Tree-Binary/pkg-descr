This module is a fully object oriented implementation of a binary tree. Binary
trees are a specialized type of tree which has only two possible branches, a
left branch and a right branch. While it is possible to use an n-ary tree, like
Tree::Simple, to fill most of your binary tree needs, a true binary tree object
is just easier to maintain and use.

Binary Tree objects are especially useful (to me anyway) when building parse
trees of things like mathematical or boolean expressions. They can also be used
in games for such things as decision trees. Binary trees are a well studied
data structure and there is a wealth of information on the web about them.
