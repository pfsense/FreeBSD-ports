The author got really tired of statements that looked like:

$heap->{job}{$job} = {
    source  => $source,
    dest    => $destination,
    options => $options,
};

and later:

if ($heap->{job}{$job}{options}{wibble} eq $something_else) {
    # do something...
}

This module is meant to simplify this sort of things, with
optional persistence as a bonus.
