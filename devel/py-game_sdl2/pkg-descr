Pygame_sdl2 is a reimplementation of the Pygame API using SDL2 and
related libraries. The initial goal of this project are to allow games
written using the pygame API to run on SDL2 on desktop and mobile
platforms. We will then evolve the API to expose SDL2-provided
functionality in a pythonic manner.
