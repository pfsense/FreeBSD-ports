Crossplatform method to trace software errors in runtime during resource
manipulation is shown. A scheme for describing abstract resources and their
functions in XML is presented. Due to separation it's possible to describe
vast classes of resources without changing the analyzer core.
Detected errors often have an influence on security, safety, robustness and
resource optimal usage.
