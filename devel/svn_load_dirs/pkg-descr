This Perl script is designed to load a number of directories into
Subversion.  This is useful if you have a number of .zip's or
tar.{Z,gz,bz2}'s for a particular package and want to load them into
Subversion.

This script is part of the Subversion distribution and it is assumed
that it can be used under the same license terms as Subversion itself.
