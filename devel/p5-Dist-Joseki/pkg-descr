"Joseki" is a japanese term from the game Go and means "a formulaic sequence of
moves which is established for giving equal outcomes to both players", but it
has come into general use to describe any fixed form of behaviour.

Dist::Joseki offers you tools that help you in developing Perl module
distributions if you stick to a certain formulaic style of structuring your
distributions.
