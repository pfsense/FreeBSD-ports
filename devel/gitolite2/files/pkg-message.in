Final gitolite installation instructions:

Any ssh user can be a gitolite provider. Simply run the following command as
the user:

%%PREFIX%%/bin/gl-setup /path/to/admin.ssh.key.pub

This will setup up the configuration files for gitolite, designating where the
repositories are located and other options.

The admin ssh key allows full access to the gitolite-admin repository where
additional users and repositories can be configured.

By default, the git user is created for use by gitolite.
