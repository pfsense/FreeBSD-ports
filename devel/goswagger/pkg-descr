Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API and
go-swagger brings to the Go community a complete suite of fully-featured,
high-performance, API components to work with a Swagger API: server, client and
data model.

This port provides a Go implementation of Swagger 2.0 (aka OpenAPI 2.0).
