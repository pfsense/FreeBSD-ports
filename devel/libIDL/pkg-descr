libIDL is a library for creating trees of CORBA Interface Definition Language
(IDL) files, which is a specification for defining portable interfaces.
libIDL was initially written for ORBit (the ORB from the GNOME project, and
the primary means of libIDL distribution).  However, the functionality was
designed to be as reusable and portable as possible.
