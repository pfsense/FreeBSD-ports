Python package for uv, an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver.

This package provides Python bindings for uv functionality and requires the
uv binary to be installed separately from the devel/uv port.

The uv module allows Python programs to programmatically interact with uv
for package management and dependency resolution tasks.
