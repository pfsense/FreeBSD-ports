MooseX::Runnable is a framework for making classes runnable applications. This
role doesn't do anything other than tell the rest of the framework that your
class is a runnable application that has a "run" method which accepts arguments
and returns the process' exit code.

This is a convention that the community has been using for a while. This role
tells the computer that your class uses this convention, and let's the computer
abstract away some of the tedium this entails.
