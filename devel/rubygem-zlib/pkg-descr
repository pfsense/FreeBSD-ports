This module provides access to the zlib library. Zlib is designed to be a
portable, free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered -- that is, not covered by
any patents -- lossless data-compression library for use on virtually any
computer hardware and operating system.

The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format with an
interface similar to that of IO. The gzip format is described in RFC 1952 which
is also a wrapper around a deflate stream.
