Durus is a persistent object system for applications written in
the Python programming language.

Durus offers an easy way to use and maintain a consistent collection
of object instances used by one or more processes. Access and change
of a persistent instances is managed through a cached Connection
instance which includes commit() and abort() methods so that changes
are transactional. Durus is best suited to collections of less than a
million instances with relatively stable state.
