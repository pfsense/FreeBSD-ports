pyjq is a Python bindings for jq (http://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

    jq is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map
    and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and
    friends let you play with text.

You can seamlessly call jq script (like regular expression) and process a plain
python data structure.

For your information, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jq is a also jq bindings but
different and incompatible with pyjq.
