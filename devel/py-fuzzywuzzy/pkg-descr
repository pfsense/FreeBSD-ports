Fuzzy string matching like a boss. It uses Levenshtein Distance to calculate
the differences between sequences in a simple-to-use package.

Simple Ratio

>>> fuzz.ratio("this is a test", "this is a test!")
    97

Partial Ratio

>>> fuzz.partial_ratio("this is a test", "this is a test!")
    100

Token Sort Ratio

>>> fuzz.ratio("fuzzy wuzzy was a bear", "wuzzy fuzzy was a bear")
    91
>>> fuzz.token_sort_ratio("fuzzy wuzzy was a bear", "wuzzy fuzzy was a bear")
    100
