hp48cc is a C-like compiler that translates the input code into the HP48 RPL
language.  The language recognized by the compiler is only a small subset of
the C language, with some non-standard extensions, but powerful enough to
write complex programs simply.

Note that GCC-based `devel/hp48xgcc' port exists which directly translates C
code into Saturn (HP48 processor) opcodes.
