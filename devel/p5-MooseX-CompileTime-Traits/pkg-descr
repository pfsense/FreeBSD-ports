MooseX::CompileTime::Traits allows role application at compile time
via use statements. What this class does is provide an import method
that will apply each of the roles (along with any arguments for
parameterized roles).

Roles and their arguments should be provided as an ArrayRef of tuples.

Simply 'with' the role to gain the functionality.
