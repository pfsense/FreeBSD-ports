Pytype checks and infers types for your Python code - without requiring type
annotations. Pytype can:
- Lint plain Python code, flagging common mistakes such as misspelled attribute
  names, incorrect function calls, and much more, even across file boundaries.
- Enforce user-provided type annotations. While annotations are optional for
  pytype, it will check and apply them where present.
- Generate type annotations in standalone files ("pyi files"), which can be
  merged back into the Python source with a provided merge-pyi tool.

Pytype is a static analyzer; it does not execute the code it runs on.

Thousands of projects at Google rely on pytype to keep their Python code
well-typed and error-free.
