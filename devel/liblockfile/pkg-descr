This library implements a number of functions found in -lmail on SysV
systems. These functions are designed to lock the standard mailboxes in
/var/mail (or wherever the system puts them).

In additions, this library adds a number of functions to create,
manage and remove generic lockfiles.

The lockfiles are created by this library in an NFS-safe manner, that
is by using a tempfile and using link(2) to create the lockfile. It
works around several defects in NFS servers to make sure the lockfile
is created atomically.

The locking strategy is compatible with other well-written NFS-safe
programs that create lockfiles - such as procmail, exim and mutt.

If you are trying to lock a mailbox in a directory writable for group
mail, the locking functions will call a helper application which runs
setgid to do the actual locking. The helper application "dotlockfile"
can also be used directly, for example for use in shellscripts.

This means a program such as a MUA doesn't need to be setgid mail anymore
to be able to lock the mailbox.
