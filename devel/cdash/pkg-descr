CDash is an open source, web-based software testing server. CDash aggregates,
analyzes and displays the results of software testing processes submitted from
clients located around the world. Developers depend on CDash to convey the state
of a software system, and to continually improve its quality. CDash is a part of
a larger software process that integrates Kitware's CMake, CTest, and CPack
tools, as well as other external packages used to design, manage and maintain
large-scale software systems.
