The pip ("Perl Installation Program") console application is used
to install Perl distributions in a wide variety of formats, both
from CPAN and from external third-party locations, while supporting
module dependencies that go across the boundary from third-party
to CPAN.

Using pip you can install CPAN modules, arbitrary tarballs from
both the local file-system or across the internet from arbitrary
URIs.

You can use pip to ensure that specific versions of CPAN modules
are installed instead of the most current version.
