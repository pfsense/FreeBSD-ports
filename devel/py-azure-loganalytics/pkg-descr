This is the Microsoft Azure Log Analytics Client Library.

Log Analytics is the primary tool in the Azure portal for writing log queries
and interactively analyzing their results. Even if a log query is used
elsewhere in Azure Monitor, you'll typically write and test the query first
using Log Analytics.
