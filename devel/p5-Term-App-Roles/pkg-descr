Term::App::Roles provides collection of roles for terminal-based application.
This role gives several options to turn on/off terminal-oriented features like
whether to use UTF8 characters, whether to use colors, and color depth. Defaults
are set from environment variables or by detecting terminal
software/capabilities.
