Serialization library for Exceptions and Tracebacks.

It allows you to:
- Pickle tracebacks and raise exceptions with pickled tracebacks in different
  processes. This allows better error handling when running code over multiple
  processes (imagine multiprocessing, billiard, futures, celery etc).
- Create traceback objects from strings (the from_string method). No pickling is
  used.
- Serialize tracebacks to/from plain dicts (the from_dict and to_dict methods).
  No pickling is used.
- Raise the tracebacks created from the aforementioned sources.
- Pickle an Exception together with its traceback and exception chain (raise ...
  from ...) (Python 3 only)

Again, note that using the pickle support is completely optional. You are solely
responsible for security problems should you decide to use the pickle support.
