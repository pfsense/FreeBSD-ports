Generic classes for representation and manipulation of dates, times and time
zones without the need of timestamps, which is a huge limitation for PHP
programs. Includes time zone data, time zone conversions and many date/time
conversions. It does not rely on 32-bit system date stamps, so you can display
calendars and compare dates that date pre 1970 and post 2038.
