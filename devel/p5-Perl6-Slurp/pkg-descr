Perl6::Slurp implements the Perl 6 'slurp' built-in. slurp takes a filename, a
filehandle, a typeglob reference, an IO::File object, or a scalar reference,
and converts it to an input stream if necessary, and reads in the entire stream.
If slurp fails to set up or read the stream, it throws an exception.
