Fennec does a ton, but it may be hard to adopt it all at once. It also
is a large project, and has not yet been fully split into component
projects. Fennec::Lite takes a minimalist approach to do for Fennec
what Mouse does for Moose.

Fennec::Lite is a single module file with no non-core dependencies. It
can easily be used by any project, either directly, or by copying it
into your project. The file itself is less than 300 lines of code at
the time of this writing, that includes whitespace.
