Rinci is a set of extensible, language-neutral metadata specifications for your
code (functions/methods, variables, packages, classes, and so on). It allows
various helper tools, from code generator to web middleware to documentation
generator to other protocols, to act on your code, making your life easier as a
programmer. Rinci also allows better interoperability between programming
languages. It is geared towards dynamic scripting languages like Perl, Python,
Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, but is not limited to those languages.
