Ubelt is a small library of robust, tested, documented, and simple functions
that extend the Python standard library. It has a flat API that all behaves
similarly on Windows, Mac, and Linux (up to some small unavoidable differences).
Almost every function in ubelt was written with a doctest. This provides helpful
documentation and example usage as well as helping achieve 100% test coverage
(with minor exceptions on Windows).
