autobox::CORE defines methods for core operations such as join,
print, most everything in perlfunc, some things from Scalar::Util
and List::Util, and some Perl 5 versions of methods taken from
Perl6.

These methods expose as methods the built-in functions for
minipulating numbers, strings, arrays, hashes, and code references.

It can be handy to use built-in functions as methods to avoid messy
dereferencing syntaxes and parentheses pile ups.
