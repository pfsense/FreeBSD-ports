Dune is a build system designed for OCaml/Reason projects only.  It focuses
on providing the user with a consistent experience and takes care of most
of the low-level details of OCaml compilation.  All you have to do is
provide a description of your project and dune will do the rest.

The scheme it implements is inspired from the one used inside Jane Street
and adapted to the open source world.  It has matured over a long time and
is used daily by hundreds of developers, which means that it is highly
tested and productive.
