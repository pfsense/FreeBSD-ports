condense-json is a Python library that provides functionality for condensing
JSON data using replacement strings. It helps reduce the size of JSON output
by replacing repeated patterns with shorter representations.

This is useful for generating more compact JSON output while maintaining
the ability to expand it back to its original form when needed, for example
when interacting with large language models.
