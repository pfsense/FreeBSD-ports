Awesome CLI is a simple but polished command-line interface for
exploring Awesome lists â€” curated collections of tools, libraries, and
resources hosted on GitHub.

The tool allows you to interactively browse categorized lists, discover
new projects, or even jump to a random entry for inspiration. It fetches
data from project-awesome.org and presents it in a terminal-friendly
format, making developer-focused exploration fast and intuitive.

Whether you're hunting for your next favorite library or just exploring
what's out there, Awesome CLI brings the universe of Awesome lists
straight to your terminal.
