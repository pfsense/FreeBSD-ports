OSSP str is a generic string library written in ISO-C which
provides functions for handling, matching, parsing, searching and
formatting of ISO-C strings. So it can be considered as a superset of POSIX
string(3), but its main intention is to provide a more convenient and
compact API plus a more generalized functionality.
