`gitoxide` is an implementation of `git` written in Rust for developing
future-proof applications which strive for correctness and performance while
providing a pleasant and unsurprising developer experience.

`gitoxide` provides the `gix` and `ein` binaries for use on the command-line
to allow experimentation with key features like `fetch` and `clone`, and to
validate the usability and control of the API.

`gitoxide` aspires to be a production-grade server implementation and the
`ein` binary aspires to become the default way to interact with git
repositories.
