This module provides the ability to use references as hash keys if you
first "tie" the hash variable to this module.  Normally, only the keys
of the tied hash itself are preserved as references; to use references
as keys in hashes-of-hashes, use Tie::RefHash::Nestable, included as
part of Tie::RefHash.

It is implemented using the standard perl TIEHASH interface.  Please
see the "tie" entry in perlfunc(1) and perltie(1) for more information.

The Nestable version works by looking for hash references being stored
and converting them to tied hashes so that they too can have references
as keys.  This will happen without warning whenever you store a refer-
ence to one of your own hashes in the tied hash.
