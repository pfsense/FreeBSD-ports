JSON::Canonicalization is an implementation of the JSON Canonicalization Scheme
for Ruby.

Cryptographic operations like hashing and signing depend on that the target data
does not change during serialization, transport, or parsing. By applying the
rules defined by JCS (JSON Canonicalization Scheme), data provided in the JSON
[RFC8259] format can be exchanged "as is", while still being subject to secure
cryptographic operations. JCS achieves this by building on the serialization
formats for JSON primitives as defined by ECMAScript [ES6], constraining JSON
data to the I-JSON [RFC7493] subset, and through a platform independent property
sorting scheme.
