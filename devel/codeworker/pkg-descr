CodeWorker is a parsing tool and a source code generator, available in
Open Source (distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License)
devoted to cover many aspects of the generative programming. Generative
programming is a software engineering approach for producing reusable,
tailor-made, evolvable and reliable IT systems with a high level of
automation.

The tool interprets a scripting language that drives the processing of
parsing and source code generation in a quite familiar syntax for
developers. It insists on adapting the syntax of the language to the
particularities of tasks to resolve (parse, code generation, procedural)
and on offering powerful functionalities to do intensive source code
generation.
