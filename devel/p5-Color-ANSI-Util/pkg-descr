Color::ANSI::Util provides routines for dealing with ANSI colors. The two main
functions are ansifg and ansibg. With those functions, you can specify colors in
RGB and let it output the correct ANSI color escape code according to the color
depth support of the terminal (whether 16-color, 256-color, or 24bit). There are
other functions to convert RGB to ANSI in specific color depths, or reverse
functions to convert from ANSI to RGB codes.
