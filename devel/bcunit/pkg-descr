This is BCUnit, a fork of the defunct project CUnit (see below), with several
fixes and patches applied.

CUnit is a Unit testing framework for C.

The basic framework is platform/version independent and should be portable to
all platforms. CUnit provides various interfaces to the framework, some of which
are platform dependent (e.g. curses on *nix). Building other interfaces should
be straightforward with the facilities provided in the framework.

CUnit is built as either a static or shared library which provides framework
support when linked into user testing code. The framework complies with the
conventional structure of test cases bundled into suites which are registered
with the framework for running.
