devel/mercurial is now flavored for Python versions.
If you have custom extensions installed, you may need
to install the Python 2 version unless all your extensions
are Python 3 compatible.

Note that we now install a few more files in %%PREFIX%%/share/mercurial:
- shell completion scripts (bash, tcsh and zsh)
- FastCGI / WSGI scripts for web access to repositories
  see http://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/PublishingRepositories
- various documentation files
