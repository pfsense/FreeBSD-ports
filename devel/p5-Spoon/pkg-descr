Spoon - A Spiffy Application Building Framework

Spoon is an Application Framework that is designed primarily for
building Social Software web applications. The Kwiki wiki software is
built on top of Spoon.

Spoon::Base is the primary base class for all the Spoon::* modules.
Spoon.pm inherits from Spiffy.pm.

Spoon is not an application in and of itself. (As compared to Kwiki) You
    need to build your own applications from it.
