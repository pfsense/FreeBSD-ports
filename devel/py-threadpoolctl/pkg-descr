Thread-pool controls provides Python helpers to limit the number of threads used
in the threadpool-backed of common native libraries used for scientific
computing and data science (e.g. BLAS and OpenMP).

Fine control of the underlying thread-pool size can be useful in workloads that
involve nested parallelism so as to mitigate oversubscription issues.
