EasyEXIF is a tiny, lightweight C++ library that parses basic information out of
JPEG files. It uses only the std::string library and is otherwise pure C++. You
pass it the binary contents of a JPEG file, and it parses several of the most
important EXIF fields for you.

Why use this library? Include one .h file, compile one .cc file, and that's it.
