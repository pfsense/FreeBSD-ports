poetry2setup converts python-poetry (pyproject.toml) to setup.py. It only relies
on poetry.core, so the effect is better than any other third-party software. The
author created this library because python-poetry does not support exporting to
setup.py and dephell will generate setup.py incorrectly in some cases.
