watchgod is a simple, modern file watching and code reload in python.

watchgod is inspired by watchdog, hence the name, but tries to fix some of the
frustrations I found with watchdog, namely: separate approaches for each OS, an
inelegant approach to concurrency using threading, challenges around debouncing
changes and bugs which weren't being fixed.
