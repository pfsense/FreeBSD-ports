A small, portable GNU readline replacement which is capable of
handling UTF-8 characters.  Unlike GNU readline, which is GPL, this
library uses a BSD license and can be used in any kind of program.

This replxx implementation is based on the work by ArangoDB Team
and Salvatore Sanfilippo and 10gen Inc.  The goal is to create a
zero-config, BSD licensed, readline replacement usable in Apache2
or BSD licensed programs.
