The pysvn module is a python interface to the Subversion version control
system. This API exposes client interfaces for managing a working copy,
querying a repository, and synchronizing the two.

This API cannot create new repositories; it can only interact with existing
repositories. If you need to create a repository, use the svnadmin command
from Subversion.

Using the API, you can check out a working copy, add, edit, and remove working
files, and check in, compare, or discard your changes. Repository properties
such as keyword expansion, end of line characters, and ignore lists can also
be examined and manipulated.
