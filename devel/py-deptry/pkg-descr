deptry is a command line tool to check for issues with dependencies in a Python
project, such as unused or missing dependencies. It supports the following types
of projects:
- Projects that use Poetry and a corresponding pyproject.toml file
- Projects that use PDM and a corresponding pyproject.toml file
- Projects that use a requirements.txt file according to the pip standards

Dependency issues are detected by scanning for imported modules within all
Python files in a directory and its subdirectories, and comparing those to the
dependencies listed in the project's requirements.
