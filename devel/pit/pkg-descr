Pit is a command-line project manager that integrates with Git.

Basic Pit entities are projects, tasks, and notes. One project
can have multiple tasks, and a task can have multiple notes.
Each entity has a number of attributes. For example, project
has name and status, task has name, status, priority, date, and
time, and within note there is message body. All attributes
except name and message body are optional and can be omitted.

The attributes have no semantic meaning, and do not have a
pre-defined set of values. For example, depending on the
particular need, the time attribute could be used as projected
time in weeks, hours spent on the task, or days left to finish
the task.

Pit tries to maintain a notion of "current" project, task, or
note. When you create new project, it automatically becomes
current. If you do not specify project number when creating a
task, the new task will be associated with the current project.
