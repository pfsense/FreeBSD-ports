gopls (pronounced "Go please") is the official Go language server
developed by the Go team.  It provides IDE features to any
LSP-compatible editor.

You should not need to interact with gopls directly---it will be
automatically integrated into your editor.  The specific features and
settings vary slightly by editor, so we recommend that you proceed to
the documentation for your editor below.
