Provides an up-to-date copy of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA) Time Zone Database. It is updated periodically to reflect
changes made by political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC
offsets, and daylight saving time rules. Additionally, this package
provides a C++ interface for working with the 'date' library. 'date'
provides comprehensive support for working with dates and date-times,
which this package exposes to make it easier for other R packages
to utilize. Headers are provided for calendar specific calculations,
along with a limited interface for time zone manipulations.
