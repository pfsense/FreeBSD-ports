rebar 3.0 is an Erlang build tool that makes it easy to compile and
test Erlang applications, port drivers and releases.

rebar is a self-contained Erlang script, so it's easy to distribute
or even embed directly in a project. Where possible, rebar uses
standard Erlang/OTP conventions for project structures, thus
minimizing the amount of build configuration work. rebar also
provides dependency management, enabling application writers to
easily re-use common libraries from a variety of locations (git,
hg, etc).
