The OSSP xds library is generic and extensible encoding and decoding
framework for the serialization of arbitrary ISO C data types.  OSSP
xds consists of three components: the generic encoding and decoding
framework, a set of shipped engines to encode and decode values in
certain existing formats (Sun RPC/XDR and XDS/XML are currently
provided), and a run-time context, which is used to manage buffers,
registered engines, etc.  The library is designed to allow fully
recursive and efficient encoding/decoding of arbitrary nested data.
