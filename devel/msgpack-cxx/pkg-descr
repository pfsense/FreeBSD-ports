MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format, which lets you
exchange data among multiple languages like JSON, except that it's faster and
smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte and short strings
require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.

This package provides C++ support. It is header-only and uses boost for all
the heavy lifting.
