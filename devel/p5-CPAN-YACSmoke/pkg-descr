This module uses the backend of CPANPLUS to run tests on modules recently
uploaded to CPAN and post results to the CPAN Testers list.

It will create a database file in the .cpanplus directory, which it uses
to track tested distributions. This information will be used to keep from
posting multiple reports for the same module, and to keep from testing
modules that use non-passing modules as prerequisites.

If it is given multiple versions of the same distribution to test, it will
test the most recent version only. If that version fails, then it will test
a previous version.

By default it uses CPANPLUS configuration settings.
