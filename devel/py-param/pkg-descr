Param is a library for handling all the user-modifiable parameters, arguments,
and attributes that control your code. It provides automatic, robust
error-checking while dramatically reducing boilerplate code, letting you focus
on what you want your code to do rather than on checking for all the possible
ways users could supply inappropriate values to a function or class.
