The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and
toolchain technologies.

This port includes Clang (a C/C++/Objective-C compiler), LLD (a linker),
an OpenMP runtime library, and the LLVM infrastructure these are built on.

The LLDB debugger has been removed from this port due to its dependency
on the obsolete python-2.7.
