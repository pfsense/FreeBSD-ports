File::Iterator wraps a simple iteration interface around the files in a
directory or directory tree. It builds a list of filenames, and maintains a
cursor that points to one filename in the list. The user can work through the
filenames sequentially by repeatedly doing stuff with the next filename that
the cursor points to until their are no filenames left.
