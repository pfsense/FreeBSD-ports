libRUIN (Renderer for User Interfaces in Ncurses) is a rendering library for
various XML-based user interface markup languages (such as XHTML or Mozilla
XUL), using the Ncurses terminal control library as a rendering target.
GNU Guile and the SDOM Scheme module are used as the "glue" that manages user
input and event handling (as such, event handlers must currently be written
in Guile Scheme; support for ECMAscript event handlers is being considered
for inclusion). An application programmer passes an XML document (including,
potentially, a set of CSS stylesheets) and an Ncurses WINDOW structure, and
libRUIN paints the WINDOW according to the markup and CSS; the programmer may
subsequently pass Ncurses-style input strings to that WINDOW via libRUIN, and
libRUIN will handle the resulting event flows.
