GenSON's core function is to take JSON objects and generate schemas that
describe them, but it is unique in its ability to merge schemas. It was
originally built to describe the common structure of a large number of
JSON objects, and it uses its merging ability to generate a single
schema from any number of JSON objects and/or schemas.
