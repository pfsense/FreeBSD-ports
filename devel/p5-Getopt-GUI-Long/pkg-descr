This module is a wrapper around Getopt::Long that extends the value of
the original Getopt::Long module to:

1) add a simple graphical user interface option screen if no arguments
   are passed to the program.
2) provide an auto-help mechanism such that -h and --help are handled
   automatically.

   It's designed to make the creation of graphical shells trivial without the
   programmer having to think about it much as well as providing automatic
   good-looking usage output without the programmer needing to write usage()
   functions.

   This also can turn normal command line programs into web CGI scripts as
   well (automatically).  If the Getopt::GUI::Long program is installed as a
   CGI script then it will automatically prompt the user for the same
   variables.
