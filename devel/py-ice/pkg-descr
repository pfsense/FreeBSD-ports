Python and Ice have much in common: they both are suited for a wide variety
of tasks, excel at application integration, and are easy for developers
to use. An Ice language mapping for Python is a recent and welcome addition
to the Ice product portfolio, enabling developers to take advantage
of the productivity offered by Python's friendly syntax and extensive
function library.
