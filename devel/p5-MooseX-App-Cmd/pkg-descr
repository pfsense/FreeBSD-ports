This module marries App::Cmd with MooseX::Getopt.

Use it like App::Cmd advises (especially see App::Cmd::Tutorial),
swapping App::Cmd::Command for MooseX::App::Cmd::Command.

Then you can write your moose commands as moose classes, with
MooseX::Getopt defining the options for you instead of opt_spec
returning a Getopt::Long::Descriptive spec.
