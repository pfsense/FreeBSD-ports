The Microsoft Authentication Extensions for Python offers secure mechanisms for
client applications to perform cross-platform token cache serialization and
persistence. It gives additional support to the Microsoft Authentication
Library for Python (MSAL).

MSAL Python supports an in-memory cache by default and provides the
SerializableTokenCache to perform cache serialization. You can read more about
this in the MSAL Python documentation. Developers are required to implement
their own cache persistance across multiple platforms and Microsoft
Authentication Extensions makes this simpler.
