treefmt - one CLI to format the code tree.

When working on large code trees, it's common to have multiple code formatters
run against it. And have one script that loops over all of them. treefmt makes
that nicer.

Features:
* A unified CLI and output
* Run all the formatters in parallel.
* Cache which files have changed for super fast re-formatting.

Just type treefmt in any folder and it reformats the whole code tree.
