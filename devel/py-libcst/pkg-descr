LibCST is a Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) parser and serializer library for Python.

LibCST parses Python source code as a CST tree that keeps all formatting details
(comments, whitespaces, parentheses, etc). It's useful for building automated
refactoring (codemod) applications and linters.

LibCST creates a compromise between an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and a
traditional Concrete Syntax Tree (CST). By carefully reorganizing and naming
node types and fields, we've created a lossless CST that looks and feels like an
AST.
