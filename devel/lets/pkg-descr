Lets is a CLI task runner for developers - a better alternative to make.

Lets was designed for developers. Its simple yet powerful task runner with lots
of features that just work.

Lets use yaml as a config format which gives a well known, human-readable syntax
with all yaml features built-in.

You can have a couple of tasks or a hundred of them in your project. Lets allow
you to focus on coding instead of writing hard-to-reason-about Makefiles.
