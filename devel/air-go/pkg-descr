Air is yet another live reloader for Go development (it does not do hot
reloading for production environments). It's extensively customizable
with a simple interface.

Air can also proxy the connection to web-serving apps to live-reload
your browser.

For many projects it is zero configuration and runs right out of the
box. For the rest, `air init` generates a config file.
