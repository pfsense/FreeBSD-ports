This module offers a lightweight Perl wrapper for the libtermkey
library, which serves as a valuable tool for abstractly handling
keypress events in terminal-based programs. Instead of delivering raw
bytes directly from the TTY device, this library furnishes data
structures that describe keys, facilitating a more organized and
user-friendly approach to key event processing.
