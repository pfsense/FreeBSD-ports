The libffi library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions. This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at run
time.

This version has the old shared library version from libffi 3.2.1.
It is stripped down and only brings in the shared library.  It is
not meant to build against.
