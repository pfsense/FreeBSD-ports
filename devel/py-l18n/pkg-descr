As you may have noticed, l18n is a contraction of i18n and l10n, namely
'internationalisation' and 'localization'. It basically provides lazy
translations for names used for localization purposes (e.g. places and
timezones).

I started writing l18n when I was looking for translations for the pytz library.
Indeed, on a multi-lingual site where users can select the timezone they are in,
it's much better if they can select in their language, as in some cases, the
differences with the english name can be significant, hence the place to look
for it when it's sorted in alphabetical order.

And as I am lazy, I thought of a way to - almost - automatically fetch the
translations from the CLDR (Unicode's Common Locale Data Repository) database.

Integrating function to link timezone to country codes, there was no reason not
to try and provide translations also for the latter. In the near future, I - or
contributors - may also add currencies or measurement units fetched from the
CLDR database ...
