The Genetic Algorithm Utility Library (or, GAUL for short) is a flexible
programming library designed to aid in the development of applications that
use genetic, or evolutionary, algorithms. It provides data structures and
functions for handling and manipulation of the data required for a genetic
algorithm. Additional stochastic algorithms are provided for comparison to the
genetic algorithms. Much of the functionality is also available through a
simple S-Lang interface.
