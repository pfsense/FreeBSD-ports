Twiggy is a code size profiler for Wasm. It analyzes a binary's call graph to
answer questions like:
* Why was this function included in the binary in the first place? Who calls it?
* What is the retained size of this function? I.e. how much space would be saved
  if I removed it and all the functions that become dead code after its removal.
