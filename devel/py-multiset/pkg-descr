The multiset package provides a multiset implementation for python.

A multiset is similar to the builtin set, but it allows an element to occur
multiple times. It is an unordered collection of elements which have to be
hashable just like in a set. It supports the same methods and operations as set
does, e.g. membership test, union, intersection, and (symmetric) difference.
