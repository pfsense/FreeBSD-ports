Parallel Events and Asynchronous tasKing Library

libpeak is an experimental C library and provides necessary support for an
event-based application. Unlike other event libraries, libpeak might process
events in parallel on Symmetric Multi-processing (SMP) systems. Its high
performance is particularly adapted for networking applications that need to
process lots of data on lots of connections.
