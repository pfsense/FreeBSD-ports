Log::Dispatch::Config is a wrapper for Log::Dispatch and provides a way to
configure Log::Dispatch objects with configuration files. Somewhat like a lite
version of log4j and Log::Log4perl it allows multiple log destinations. The
standard configuration file format for Log::Dispatch::Config is AppConfig.

This module plugs in to Log::Dispatch::Config and allows the use of other file
formats, in fact any format supported by the Config::Any module. As a bonus you
can also pass in a configuration data structure instead of a file name.
