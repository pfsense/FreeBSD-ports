PEP 517 specifies a standard API for systems which build Python packages.

This package contains wrappers around the hooks specified by PEP 517. It
provides:
- A mechanism to call the hooks in a subprocess, so they are isolated from the
  current process.
- Fallbacks for the optional hooks, so that frontends can call the hooks without
  checking which are defined.
- Higher-level functions which install the build dependencies into a temporary
  environment and build a wheel/sdist using them.
