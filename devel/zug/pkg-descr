Zug is a C++ library providing transducers. Transducers are composable
sequential transformations independent of the source. They are extremely
lightweight, and can be used to express algorithms over pull-based
sequences (iterators, files) but also push based sequences (signals,
events, asynchronous streams) in a generic way.
