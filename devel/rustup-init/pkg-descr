Rustup-init is the official installer for the Rust programming language.
It is used to install and manage Rust toolchains, including the Rust
compiler (rustc), the package manager (cargo), and other related tools.
Rustup itself is a toolchain multiplexer, meaning it allows you to easily
switch between different versions of Rust (e.g., stable, beta, nightly) and
manage cross-compilation targets. Rustup-init is the recommended way to install
Rust, as it provides a consistent and flexible way to manage Rust installations
across different platforms.
