BTest is a powerful framework for writing system tests. Freely
borrowing some ideas from other packages, its main objective is to
provide an easy-to-use, straightforward driver for a suite of
shell-based tests. Each test consists of a set of command lines
that will be executed, and success is determined based on their
exit codes. btest comes with some additional tools that can be used
within such tests to robustly compare output against a previously
established baseline.
