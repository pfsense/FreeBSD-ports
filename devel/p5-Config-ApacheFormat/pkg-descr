This module is designed to parse a configuration file in the same syntax
used by the Apache web server (see http://httpd.apache.org for
details). This allows you to build applications which can be easily
managed by experienced Apache admins. Also, by using this module,
you'll benefit from the support for nested blocks with built-in
parameter inheritance. This can greatly reduce the amount or repeated
information in your configuration files.

A good reference to the Apache configuration file format can be found
here:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/configuring.html
