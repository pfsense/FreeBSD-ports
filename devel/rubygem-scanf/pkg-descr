scanf is an implementation of the C function scanf(3), modified as necessary
for Ruby compatibility.

The methods provided are String#scanf, IO#scanf, and Kernel#scanf. Kernel#scanf
is a wrapper around STDIN.scanf. IO#scanf can be used on any IO stream,
including file handles and sockets. scanf can be called either with or without
a block.
