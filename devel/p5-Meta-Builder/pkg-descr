Meta::Builder is designed to be a generic tool for writing Meta
objects. Unlike specialized tools, Meta::Builder makes no assumptions
about what metrics you will care about. Meta::Builder also mkaes it
simple for others to extend your meta-object based tools by providing
hooks for other packages to add metrics to your meta object.
