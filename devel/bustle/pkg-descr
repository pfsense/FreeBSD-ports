Bustle draws sequence diagrams of D-Bus activity, showing signal
emissions, method calls and their corresponding returns, with
timestamps for each individual event and the duration of each method
call. This can help you check for unwanted D-Bus traffic, and pinpoint
why your D-Bus-based application isn't performing as well as you
like. It also provides statistics like signal frequencies and average
method call times.
