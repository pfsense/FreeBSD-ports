The Inline::Python module allows you to put Python source code directly
"inline" in a Perl script or module. It sets up an in-process Python
interpreter, runs your code, and then examines Python's symbol table for
things to bind to Perl. The process of interrogating the Python
interpreter for globals only occurs the first time you run your Python
code. The namespace is cached, and subsequent calls use the cached version.
