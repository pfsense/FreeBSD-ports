Progress bars are handy - they tell you how much work has been done, how much
is left to do and estimate how long it will take. But they can be fiddly! This
module does the right thing in almost all cases in a really convenient way.

It wraps Term::ProgressBar::Quiet so there is no output unless the code is
running interactively - lets you put them in cron scripts.

It deals with minor updates - only refreshes the screen when it will change
what the user sees so it is efficient.

It completes the progress bar when the progress object is destroyed (explicitly
or by going out of scope) - no more '99%' done.
