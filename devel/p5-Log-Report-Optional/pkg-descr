Log::Report::Optional will allow libraries (helper modules) to have a dependency
to a small module instead of the full Log-Report distribution. The full power of
Log::Report is only released when the main program uses that module. In that
case, the module using the 'Optional' will also use the full Log::Report,
otherwise the dressed-down Log::Report::Minimal version.
