Implements a parser for HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) in Python.
This implementation aims to be compatible with the original golang version of
the parser.

The grammar and many of the tests/fixtures were copied/ported from the golang
parser into pyhcl. All releases are tested with a variety of Python versions
from Python 2.7 onward.
