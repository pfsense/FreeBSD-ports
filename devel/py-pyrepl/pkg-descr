pyrepl is a Python library, inspired by readline, for building flexible command
line interfaces, featuring:
-  sane multi-line editing
-  history, with incremental search
-  completion, including displaying of available options
-  a fairly large subset of the readline emacs-mode keybindings
-  a liberal, Python-style, license
-  a new python top-level.
