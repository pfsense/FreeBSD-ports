libshbuf implements a new kind of IPC: the "shared buffer", a faster, more
flexible replacement for standard Unix FIFOs. It offers the following
advantages:
   - Normally better latency and throughput
   - Full access to the buffer at any time
   - Connecting processes need not to be children of each other
   - Arbitrary buffer lengths
   - Memory mapped
   - "Backlog"

The implementation is based on SysV shared memory, semaphores and message
queues. It makes use of POSIX pthreads.
