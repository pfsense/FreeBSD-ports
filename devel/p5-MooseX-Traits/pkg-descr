Often you want to create components that can be added to a class
arbitrarily.  This module makes it easy for the end user to use these
components.  Instead of requiring the user to create a named class with
the desired roles applied, or applying roles to the instance one-by-one,
he can just pass a traits parameter to the class's new_with_traits
constructor.  This role will then apply the roles in one go, cache the
resulting class (for efficiency), and return a new instance.  Arguments
meant to initialize the applied roles' attributes can also be passed to
the constructor.
