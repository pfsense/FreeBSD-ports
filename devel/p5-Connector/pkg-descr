The Connector provides a generic connection to a data set, typically
configuration data in a hierarchical structure. Each connector
object accepts the get(KEY) method, which, when given a key, returns
the associated value from the connector's data source. Typically,
a connector acts as a proxy to a simple data source like YAML,
Config::Std, Config::Versioned, or to a more complex data source
like an LDAP server or Proc::SafeExec. The standard calling convention
via get(KEY) makes the connectors interchangeable.
