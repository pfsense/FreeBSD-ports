  message: <<EOM
TIGCC is now installed but in order for it
to work you need to define some stuff.

The TIGCC environment variable must point to
the folder where TIGCC is installed.

Additionally the TIGCC bin folder must be in the path.

If you use the csh shell you would put something like

setenv TIGCC	%%PREFIX%%/tigcc
setenv PATH	$PATH:$TIGCC/bin

into the .cshrc file in your home directory.
