A perl module that is designed to provide easy to use settings
files for your project. You subclass the basic Config::Setting
class in one of your own modules, and then provide an interface to
your code using it. When set up, you can then override the settings
on a per-host basis, or even using an environment variable.

By default a win.ini style of configuration is used, but this can
be overridden and an XML based configuration is also included. The
access mechanism can also be overridden, the setting don't have to
come from a file, but (maybe) from a web site. You'll have to write
your own there, though.
