GitQlient, pronounced as git+client is a multi-platform Git client.
The original idea was to provide a GUI-oriented Git clientthat was
easy to integrate with QtCreator. In addition, one goal was to
modernize the old code that QGit is based on and provide a easy UI/UX
that I was actually missing on other clients.

- Visualisation and search of git history, branches, tags
- Git operations such as commit, cherry-pick
- Workflow support including pomodoro
- Multiple repositories
