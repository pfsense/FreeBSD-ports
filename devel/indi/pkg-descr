INDI is a standard for astronomical instrumentation control. INDI Library is
an Open Source POSIX implementation of the Instrument-Neutral-Device-Interface
protocol.

INDI core library is composed of the following components:
 * INDI Server.
 * INDI Core Drivers: Hardware drivers that communicate with the equipment.
   Many devices are supported including:
   - Mounts
   - CCDs, CMOS, Webcams, DSLRs (Canon, Nikon, Sony, Pentax..etc).
   - Focusers
   - Filter Wheels
   - Adaptive Optics
   - Domes
   - GPS
   - Weather Stations
   - Controllers
   - Auxiliary Devices (switches, watchdog, relays, light sources, measurement
     devices..etc).
 * Client Library: Cross-platform POSIX and Qt5-based client libraries. The
   client libraries can be embedded in 3rd party applications to communicate
   with INDI server and devices.
