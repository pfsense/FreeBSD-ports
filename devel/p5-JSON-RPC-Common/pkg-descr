p5::JSON::RPC-Common is a perl module provides abstractions for
JSON-RPC 1.0, 1.1 (both variations) and 2.0 (formerly 1.2)
Procedure Call and Procedure Return objects (formerly known as
request and result), along with error objects. It also provides
marshalling objects to convert the model objects into JSON text
and HTTP requests/responses.
