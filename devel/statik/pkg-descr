statik allows you to embed a directory of static files into your
Go binary to be later served from an http.FileSystem. Is this a
crazy idea?  No, not necessarily. If you're building a tool that
has a Web component, you typically want to serve some images, CSS
and JavaScript. You like the comfort of distributing a single binary,
so you don't want to mess with deploying them elsewhere. If your
static files are not large in size and will be browsed by a few
people, statik is a solution you are looking for.
