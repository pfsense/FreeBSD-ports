Pydantic-Vault is a simple extension to Pydantic BaseSettings that can retrieve
secrets stored in Hashicorp Vault

With Pydantic and Pydantic-Vault, you can easily declare your configuration in a
type-hinted class, and load configuration from environment variables or Vault
secrets. Pydantic-Vault will work the same when developing locally (where you
probably login with the Vault CLI and your own user account) and when deploying
in production (using a Vault Approle or Kubernetes authentication for example).
