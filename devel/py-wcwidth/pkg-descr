This API is mainly for Terminal Emulator implementors -- any python program
that attempts to determine the printable width of a string on a Terminal.

It is certainly possible to use your Operating System's wcwidth() and
wcswidth() calls if it is POSIX-conforming, but this would not be possible on
non-POSIX platforms, such as Windows, or for alternative Python
implementations, such as jython.
