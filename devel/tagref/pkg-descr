tagref helps to maintain code references in codebases.

Tagref ensures such references remain valid. If someone tries to delete or
rename the tag, Tagref will complain. More precisely, it checks the following:
1. References actually point to tags. A tag cannot be deleted or renamed
   without updating the references that point to it.
2. Tags are distinct. There is never any ambiguity about which tag is being
   referenced.
