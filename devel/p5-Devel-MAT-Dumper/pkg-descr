Devel::MAT::Dumper provides the memory-dumping function that creates a heap dump
file which can later be read by Devel::MAT::Dumpfile. It provides a single
function which is not exported, which writes a file to the given path.

The dump file will contain a representation of every SV in Perl's arena,
providing information about pointers between them, as well as other information
about the state of the process at the time it was created. It contains a
snapshot of the process at that moment in time, which can later be loaded and
analysed by various tools using Devel::MAT::Dumpfile.

This module used to be part of the main Devel::MAT distribution but is now in
its own one so that it can be installed independently on servers or other
locations where perl processes need to inspected but analysis tools can be run
elsewhere.
