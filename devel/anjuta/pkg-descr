Anjuta is a very versatile Integrated development environment for
C and C++.  Written in GTK/GNOME and written for GTK+/GNOME,
it features many advanced programming tools and utilities.  It is
basically a GUI interface for the bunch of command line programming
utilities and tools available for FreeBSD, which are usually run in console
and are very user unfriendly.
