Ever find yourself repeatedly specifying writers and builders, because there's
no good shortcut to specifying them?  Sometimes you want an attribute to have
a read-only public interface, but a private writer.  And wouldn't it be easier
to just say "builder => 1" and have the attribute construct the canonical
"_build_$name" builder name for you?
