Testing is usually the ugly part of Perl module authoring. Perl gives
you a standard way to run tests with Test::Harness, and basic testing
primitives with Test::More. After that you are pretty much on your own
to develop a testing framework and philosophy. Test::More encourages you
to make your own framework by subclassing Test::Builder, but that is not
trivial.

Test::Base gives you a way to write your own test framework base class
that *is* trivial.
