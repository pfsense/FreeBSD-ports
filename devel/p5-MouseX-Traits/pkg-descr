Often you want to create components that can be added to a class arbitrarily.
MouseX::Traits makes it easy for the end user to use these components. Instead
of requiring the user to create a named class with the desired roles applied,
or apply roles to the instance one-by-one, he can just create a new class from
yours with with_traits, and then instantiate that.
