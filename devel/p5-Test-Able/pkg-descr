An xUnit style testing framework inspired by Test::Class and built using Moose.
It can do all the important things Test::Class can do and more.
The prime advantages of using this module instead of Test::Class are
flexibility and power. Namely, Moose.

This module was created for a few of reasons:

To address perceived limitations in, and downfalls of, Test::Class.
To leverage existing Moose expertise for testing.
To bring Moose to the Perl testing game.
