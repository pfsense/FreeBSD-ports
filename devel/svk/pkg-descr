svk is a decentralized version control system written in Perl.
It uses the subversion filesystem but provides additional features:

    - Offline operations like checkin, log, merge.
    - Distributed branches.
    - Lightweight checkout copy management (no .svn directories).
    - Advanced merge algorithms, like star-merge and cherry picking.
