This module provides a convenient way to perform cleanup or other forms of
resource management at the end of a scope. It is particularly useful when
dealing with exceptions: the Scope::Guard constructor takes a reference to a
subroutine that is guaranteed to be called even if the thread of execution is
aborted prematurely. This effectively allows lexically-scoped "promises" to be
made that are automatically honoured by perl's garbage collector.
