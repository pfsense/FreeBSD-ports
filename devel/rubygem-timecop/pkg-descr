timecop is a gem providing "time travel" and "time freezing" capabilities,
making it dead simple to test time-dependent code. It provides a unified method
to mock Time.now, Date.today, and DateTime.now in a single call.

Features:
- Freeze time to a specific point.
- Travel back to a specific point in time, but allow time to continue moving
  forward from there.
- Scale time by a given scaling factor that will cause time to move at an
  accelerated pace.
- No dependencies, can be used with any ruby project
- Timecop api allows arguments to be passed into #freeze and #travel as one of
  the following:
  - Time instance
  - DateTime instance
  - Date instance
  - individual arguments (year, month, day, hour, minute, second)
  - a single integer argument that is interpreted as an offset in seconds from
    Time.now
- Nested calls to Timecop#travel and Timecop#freeze are supported -- each block
  will maintain its interpretation of now.
- Works with regular Ruby projects, and Ruby on Rails projects
