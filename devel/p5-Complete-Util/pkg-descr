This package provides some generic completion routines that follow the
Complete convention.  The main routine is complete_array_elem which
tries to complete a word using choices from elements of supplied array.

The routine will first try a simple substring prefix matching; if that
fails, will try some other methods like word-mode, character-mode, or
fuzzy matching.
