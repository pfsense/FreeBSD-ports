The new isa operator in Perl 5.32 is pretty great, but if you need to support
legacy versions of Perl, you can't use it yet. This module gives you isa-like
functions you can use in Perl 5.6 and above.

If you've got Type::Tiny::XS installed, you will probably find that this module
is faster than the native isa operator!

The functions exported respect inheritance and allow classes to override their
isa method as you'd expect.
