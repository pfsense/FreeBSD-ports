JLine is a Java library for handling console input. It is similar in
functionality to BSD editline and GNU readline. People familiar with
the readline/editline capabilities for modern shells (such as bash and
tcsh) will find most of the command editing features of JLine to be
familiar.

JLine is distributed under the BSD license, meaning that you are
completely free to redistribute, modify, or sell it with almost no
restrictions.

API documentation can be found in the apidocs directory.

You can use the jline.ConsoleRunner application to set up the system
input stream and continue on the launch another program. For example,
to use JLine as the input handler for the popular BeanShell console
application, you can run: java jline.ConsoleRunner bsh.Interpreter
