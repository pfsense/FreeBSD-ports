Cpphs is a re-implementation of the C pre-processor that is both more
compatible with Haskell, and itself written in Haskell so that it can be
distributed with compilers. This version of the C pre-processor is
pretty-much feature-complete and compatible with traditional (K&R)
pre-processors. Additional features include: a plain-text mode; an option
to unlit literate code files; and an option to turn off macro-expansion.
