This ITT/JIT open source profiling API includes:

- Instrumentation and Tracing Technology (ITT) API
- Just-In-Time (JIT) Profiling API

The Instrumentation and Tracing Technology (ITT) API enables your application to
generate and control the collection of trace data during its execution across
different Intel tools.

ITT API consists of two parts: a static part and a dynamic part. The dynamic
part is specific for a tool and distributed only with a particular tool. The
static part is a common part shared between tools.
