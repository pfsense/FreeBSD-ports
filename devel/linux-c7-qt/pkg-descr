Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework for developers
using C++ or QML, a CSS/JavaScript-like language.

With Qt, code can be reused efficiently to target multiple platforms
with one code base. The modular C++ class library and developer tools
easily enables developers to create applications for one platform and
easily build and run to deploy on another platform.
