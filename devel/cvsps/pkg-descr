CVSps is a program for generating 'patchset' information from a CVS
repository. A patchset in this case is defined as a set of changes made
to a collection of files, and all committed at the same time (using a
single 'cvs commit' command). This information is valuable to seeing the
big picture of the evolution of a cvs project. While cvs tracks revision
information, it is often difficult to see what changes were committed
'atomically' to the repository.
