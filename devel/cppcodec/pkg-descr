Header-only C++11 library to encode/decode base64, base64url, base32,
base32hex and hex (a.k.a. base16) as specified in RFC 4648, plus
Crockford's base32.

MIT licensed with consistent, flexible API. Supports raw pointers,
std::string and (templated) character vectors without unnecessary
allocations. Cross-platform with measured decent performance and
without compiler warnings.
