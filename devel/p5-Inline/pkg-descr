The Inline module allows you to put source code from other programming
languages directly "inline" in a Perl script or module. The code is
automatically compiled as needed, and then loaded for immediate access
from Perl.

Inline saves you from the hassle of having to write and compile your own
glue code using facilities like XS or SWIG. Simply type the code where
you want it and run your Perl as normal. All the hairy details are
handled for you. The compilation and installation of your code chunks
all happen transparently; all you will notice is the delay of
compilation on the first run.

The Inline code only gets compiled the first time you run it (or
whenever it is modified) so you only take the performance hit once. Code
that is Inlined into distributed modules (like on the CPAN) will get
compiled when the module is installed, so the end user will never notice
the compilation time.
