ShowTable.pm, is a Perl 5 module which defines subroutines to print arrays
of data in a nicely formatted listing, using one of four possible formats:
simple table, boxed table, list style, and HTML-formatting (for
World-Wide-Web output).  See the documentation on ShowTable.pm for details
on the formatting.

The program "showtable" reads data in a variety of formats from a file or
STDIN, optimally columnizes the data, and then feeds the array of data to
the ShowTable module for display.  Showtable can parse its own output as
input (except for HTML).  Individual or ranges of columns may be selected
for display, either by name or by index.

In other words, showtable is a data formatting program.  Using the '-html'
option, showtable can accept ASCII tabular data and format it appropriately
for display through a Web-browser.
