MooseX::MarkAsMethods allows one to easily mark certain functions as Moose
methods. This will allow other packages such as namespace::autoclean to operate
without blowing away your overloads. After using MooseX::MarkAsMethods your
overloads will be recognized by Class::MOP as being methods, and class extension
as well as composition from roles with overloads will "just work".

By default we check for overloads, and mark those functions as methods.

If 'autoclean => 1' is passed to import on use'ing this module, we will invoke
namespace::autoclean to clear out non-methods.
