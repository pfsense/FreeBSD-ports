The port will install an htdocs dir %%WWWDIR%%.
Copy %%WWWDIR%%/config.ini-example
to %%WWWDIR%%/config.ini and
edit it to make it use your git repositories.
Then configure your webserver to use the htdocs directory.
Make sure mod_rewrite is enabled in your webserver,
else the url-rewrite will not work and result in a 404 when accessing a repository.
