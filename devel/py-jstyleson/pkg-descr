jstyleson is a Python library designed to parse JSON data that includes
JavaScript-style comments (single-line and multi-line) and trailing commas.
Standard JSON does not permit these features, and the default Python json
module cannot handle them. This library preprocesses such JSON strings to
remove comments and trailing commas, making them compatible with the standard
json module. It provides wrapper functions around the standard json module
for convenience.
