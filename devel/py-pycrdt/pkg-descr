Pycrdt is a Python CRDT library that provides bindings for Yrs, the Rust port of
the Yjs framework.

Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) allow creating shared documents that
can automatically merge changes made concurrently on different "copies" of the
data. When the data lives on different machines, they make it possible to build
distributed systems that work with local data, leaving the synchronization and
conflict resolution with remote data to the CRDT algorithm, which ensures that
all data replicas eventually converge to the same state.
