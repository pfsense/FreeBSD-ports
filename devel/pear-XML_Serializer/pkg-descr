PEAR::XML_Serializer serializes complex data structures like arrays
or object as XML documents.

This class helps you generating any XML document you require without
the need for DOM.

Furthermore this package can be used as a replacement to serialize()
and unserialize() as it comes with a matching XML_Unserializer that
is able to create PHP data structures (like arrays and objects)
from XML documents, if type hints are available.

If you use the XML_Unserializer on standard XML files, it will try
to guess how it has to be unserialized. In most cases it does exactly
what you expect it to do.

Try reading a RSS file with XML_Unserializer and you have the whole
RSS file in a structured array or even a collection of objects,
similar to XML_RSS.

Since version 0.8.0 the package is able to treat XML documents
similar to the simplexml extension of PHP 5.
