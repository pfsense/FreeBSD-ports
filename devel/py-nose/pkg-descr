nose provides an alternate test discovery and running process for
unittest, one that is intended to mimic the behavior of py.test as
much as is reasonably possible without resorting to magic. By default,
nose will run tests in files or directories under the current working
directory whose names include "test". nose also supports doctest tests
and may optionally provide a test coverage report.
