MooseX-App is a highly customizeable helper to write user-friendly command-line
applications without having to worry about most of the annoying things usually
involved. Just take any existing Moose class, add a single line (use MooseX-App
qw(PluginA PluginB ...)) and create one class for each command in an underlying
namespace.

MooseX-App will then take care of
- Finding, loading and initializing the command classes
- Creating automated doucumentation
- Reading and validating the command line options entered by the user

Read the Tutorial for getting started with a simple MooseX::App command line
application.
