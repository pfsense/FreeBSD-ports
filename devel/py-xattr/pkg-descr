xattr is a Python wrapper for extended filesystem attributes.

xattr also ships with an xattr command line tool for viewing and editing
extended filesystem attributes. On platforms that support or ship with the attr
package, you may prefer to use the getfattr and setfattr command line tools from
the attr package.

Extended attributes extend the basic attributes of files and directories in the
file system. They are stored as name:data pairs associated with file system
objects (files, directories, symlinks, etc).
