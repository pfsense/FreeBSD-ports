Trimesh is a pure Python (2.7-3.4+) library for loading and using triangular
meshes with an emphasis on watertight surfaces. The goal of the library
is to provide a full featured and well tested Trimesh object which allows
for easy manipulation and analysis, in the style of the Polygon object in
the Shapely library.

The API is mostly stable, but this should not be relied on and is not
guaranteed: install a specific version if you plan on deploying something
using trimesh.
