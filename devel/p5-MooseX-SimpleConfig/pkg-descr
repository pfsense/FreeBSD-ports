This role loads simple configfiles to set object attributes. It is
based on the abstract role MooseX::ConfigFromFile, and uses Config::Any
to load your configfile. Config::Any will in turn support any of a
variety of different config formats, detected by the file extension.
See Config::Any for more details about supported formats.
