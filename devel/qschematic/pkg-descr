QSchematic is a C++ library providing Qt widgets to easily draw diagrams and
schematics in a Qt application. It uses Qt's graphics view framework.

The library interface allows for easy customization of existing items and adding
new custom items such as wires, nodes, connectors and similar.

Drawn diagrams/schematics can be easily serialized to and from XML or YAML.
A built-in netlist generator is provided to build a netlist from a drawn
diagram/schematic.
