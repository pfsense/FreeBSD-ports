Boltons is a set of over 230 BSD-licensed, pure-Python utilities in the same
spirit as -- and yet conspicuously missing from -- the standard library,
including:
- Atomic file saving, bolted on with fileutils
- A highly-optimized OrderedMultiDict, in dictutils
- Two types of PriorityQueue, in queueutils
- Chunked and windowed iteration, in iterutils
- Recursive data structure iteration and merging, with iterutils.remap
- Exponential backoff functionality, including jitter, through iterutils.backoff
- A full-featured TracebackInfo type, for representing stack traces, in tbutils
