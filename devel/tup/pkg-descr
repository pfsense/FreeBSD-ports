Tup is a file-based build system for Unix and Windows.  It takes as input
a list of file changes and a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  It then
processes the DAG to execute the appropriate commands required to update
dependent files.  Updates are performed with very little overhead since
tup implements powerful build algorithms to avoid doing unnecessary work,
so you can stay focused on your project rather than on your build system.
