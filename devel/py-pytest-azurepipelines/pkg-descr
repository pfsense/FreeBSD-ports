Make pytest easier to use with Microsoft Azure Pipelines. Just run pytest with
this plugin and see your test results in the Azure Pipelines UI!

Features:
- Formats the PyTest output to show test docstrings and module names instead of
  just test case names in the Azure Pipelines UI.
- Uploads test results automatically, no need for a separate test results upload
  command
- Displays the number of failed tests if there were failures as an error message
  in the UI
- Automatically formats code coverage and uploads coverage data if pytest-cov is
  installed
- Supports running inside a Docker container and automatically uploads test
  results
