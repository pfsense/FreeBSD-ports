C/C++ preprocessor defines and expands macros and processes '#if',
'#include' and some other directives.

MCPP is an alternative C/C++ preprocessor with the highest conformance.
It supports multiple standards: K&R, ISO C90, ISO C99, and ISO C++98.
MCPP is especially useful for debugging a source program which use
complicated macros and also useful for checking portability of a source.

Though mcpp could be built as a replacement of GCC's resident
preprocessor or as a stand-alone program without using library build of
mcpp, this package installs a program named 'mcpp' which links shared
library of libmcpp and behaves independent from GCC.
