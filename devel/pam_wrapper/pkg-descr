This tool allows you to either test your PAM application or module. For testing
PAM applications we have written a simple PAM module called pam_matrix
(see below). If you plan to test a PAM module you can use the pamtest library
we have implemented. It simplifies testing of modules. You can be combine it
with the cmocka unit testing framework or you can use the provided Python
bindings to write tests for your module in Python.
