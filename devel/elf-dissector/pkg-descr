ELF Dissector: Static analysis tool for ELF libraries and executables.

ELF Dissector is useful if you need to do one or more of the following:

- Inspecting forward and backward dependencies, on library
  and symbol level.
- Identifying load-time performance bottlenecks such as expensive
  static constructors or excessive relocations.
- Size profiling of ELF files.
