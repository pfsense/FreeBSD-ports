pprof is a tool for visualization and analysis of profiling data.

pprof reads a collection of profiling samples in profile.proto format and
generates reports to visualize and help analyze the data. It can generate
both text and graphical reports (through the use of the dot visualization
package).

Profiles can be read from a local file, or over http. Multiple profiles of
the same type can be aggregated or compared.

If the profile samples contain machine addresses, pprof can symbolize them
through the use of the native binutils tools (addr2line and nm).
