AndroidManifest.xml file in an APK file is binary encoded.  This tool
accepts either a binary or a text XML file and prints the decoded XML to
the standard output or a file.  It also allows you to extract the decoded
AndroidManifest.xml directly from an APK file.

Popular tools such as Apktool are designed to process the whole APK file
including the resource files for reverse engineering purpose.  They may
also need a Java virtual machine to run.  As a result, they are too slow
for batch processing many APK files just to get the XML information.  In
contrast, axmldec is specialized for binary XML decoding and written in
simple modern C++, so it runs nicely within a shell script.
