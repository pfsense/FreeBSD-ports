Devel::Size can only report the size of a single element or the total size of a
structure (array, hash etc). This module enhances Devel::Size by giving you the
ability to generate a full size report for each element in a structure.

You have full control over how the generated text report looks like, and where
you want to output it. In addition, the method track_size allows you to get at
the raw data that is used to generate the report for even more flexibility.
