Combined scanner/parser generator for LR compliant grammar definitions.

The generated C++ parser class is used as a super class from which a parser
implementation class must be derived. The implementation class implements the
scanner feed methods but also all required semantic action method. dragon has
been used for several large projects with complex grammar definitions (about
200 productions/ 80 tokens ). Since for those grammar defintions, the analyse
phase to build up the parse table is quite CPU intensive, it is recommended to
use state of the art hardware. dragon requires the base package to get compiled
but also for the compilation of the generated C++ code.

It can be used for databases/cego and probably other applications.
