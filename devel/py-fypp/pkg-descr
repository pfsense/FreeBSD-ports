Fypp is a Python powered preprocessor. It can be used for any programming
languages but its primary aim is to offer a Fortran preprocessor, which helps
to extend Fortran with condititional compiling and template metaprogramming
capabilities. Instead of introducing its own expression syntax, it uses Python
expressions in its preprocessor directives, offering the consistency and
versatility of Python when formulating metaprogramming tasks. It puts strong
emphasis on robustness and on neat integration into developing toolchains.
