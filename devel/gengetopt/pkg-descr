This program generate a C function that uses getopt_long function to parse
the command line options, validate them and fill a struct.

Thus your program can now handle options such as:

	myprog --input foo.c -o foo.o --no-tabs -i 100 *.class

And both long options (those that start with --) and short options (start
with - and consist of only one character) can be handled. For standards
about short and long options you may want to take a look at the GNU Coding
Standards.
