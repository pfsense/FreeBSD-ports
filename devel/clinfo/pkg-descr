clinfo is a simple command-line application that enumerates all possible
(known) properties of the OpenCL platform and devices available on the
system.

Inspired by AMD's program of the same name, it is coded in pure C and it
tries to output all possible information, including those provided by
platform-specific extensions, trying not to crash on unsupported
properties (e.g. 1.2 properties on 1.1 platforms).
