This package contains the data files for the m17n library. m17n-lib
currently supports input of more than 60 languages with more than 150
language specific input methods.

m17n-db now incorporates a set of user-contributed input methods,
formerly known as m17n-contrib.

The package also provides the tbl2mim.awk script for conversion of keyboard
files used by table based IMEngines of SCIM/IBus into m17n-lib's .mim
format.

The documentation is available through devel/m17n-docs.
