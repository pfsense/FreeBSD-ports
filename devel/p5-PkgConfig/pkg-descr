PkgConfig provides a pure-perl, core-only replacement for the pkg-config
utility.

This is not a description of the uses of pkg-config but rather a description of
the differences between the C version and the Perl one.

While pkg-config is a compiled binary linked with glib, the pure-perl version
has no such requirement, and will run wherever Perl ( >= 5.6 ) does.

The main supported options are the common --libs, --cflags, --static, --exists
and --modversion.
