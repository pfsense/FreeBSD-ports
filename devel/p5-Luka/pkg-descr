Luka is an exception handling and reporting framework. It's useful to look at it
as an event handling framework.

It comes from operational understanding of networks.

Scenario that Luka is addressing is following: on a network with multiple hosts
running multiple applications, it is very difficult to track operational status
of all the functionality that those applications and hosts are meant to deliver.
In order to make it easier, we decided to specify the error handling and
reporting data model that each component delivering functionality has to conform
to.  What is a component? In most cases, it is a script, often run from cronjob,
in some cases it is a class in an application. In all cases, a component has to
successfully complete a task on which functionality of an application, or entire
network, relies on.

It is common practice that programmers choose their way of handling errors and
reporting. Luka is an attempt to standardize that process.  Its primary goal is
to make it easier for smaller number of people to keep larger number of
applications and networks running.
