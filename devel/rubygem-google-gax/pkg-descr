Google API Extensions for Ruby (gax-ruby) is a set of modules which aids the
development of APIs for clients and servers based on gRPC and Google API
conventions.

Application code will rarely need to use most of the classes within this library
directly, but code generated automatically from the API definition files in
Google APIs can use services such as page streaming and request bundling to
provide a more convenient and idiomatic API surface to callers.
