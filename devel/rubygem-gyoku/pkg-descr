Gyoku is a Ruby library that helps convert Ruby hashes into XML. It offers a
simple and readable way to build XML structures, and supports features like
attributes, namespaces, and custom element names.

It's often used with SOAP clients like Savon, but can be useful in any Ruby
project that needs to generate XML from structured data.
