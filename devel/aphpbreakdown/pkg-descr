PHP classes, functions and constants found in your project. For the
collection of classes, functions and constants it determined all
modules of PHP needed to be installed on the webserver for your
project.

To display the result of the analysis you can choose different ways.
One way is to display an output on your command line. But what do
you do if you don't have a command line access on the server you
want to test?  Then you use the testfile generator of aPHPbreakdown!
It generates a testfile you can upload to the webserver, or sent
it to you customer to upload it, and run it very simple in the
