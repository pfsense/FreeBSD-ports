user_agents is a Python library that provides an easy way to identify/detect
devices like mobile phones, tablets and their capabilities by parsing (browser) user agent strings.  The goal is to reliably detect whether:

-- User agent is a mobile, tablet or PC based device
-- User agent has touch capabilities (has touch screen)

user_agents relies on the excellent ua-parser to do the actual parsing of the
raw user agent string.
