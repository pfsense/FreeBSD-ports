tcllauncher is a way to have Tcl programs run out of /usr/local/bin under their
own name, be installed in one place with their support files, and provides
commands to facilitate server-oriented application execution.

While there is another wrapper system that also does this, that system produces
a single executable that contains all the code and support files within a
built-in virtual filesystem wrapped inside the executable. Tcllauncher keeps
the support files distinct, typically in a subdirectory of /usr/local/lib
that's named after the application.
