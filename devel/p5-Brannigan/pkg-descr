Brannigan is an attempt to ease the pain of collecting, validating and parsing
input parameters in web applications. It's designed to answer both of the main
problems that web applications face:

* Simple user input
	Brannigan can validate and parse simple, "flat", user input, possibly
	coming from web forms.

Complex data structures
	Brannigan can validate and parse complex data structures, possibly
	deserialized from JSON or XML data sent to web services and APIs.
