The cargo-make task runner enables to define and configure sets of tasks and
run them as a flow.

A task is a command, script, rust code, or other sub tasks to execute. Tasks
can have dependencies which are also tasks that will be executed before the
task itself. With a simple toml based configuration file, you can define a
multi platform build script that can run build, test, generate documentation,
run bench tests, run security validations and more, executed by running a
single command.
