You can enable distributed tracing in Azure client libraries by configuring the
OpenTelemetry SDK. OpenTelemetry is a popular open-source observability
framework for generating, capturing, and collecting telemetry data for
cloud-native software.

There are two key concepts related to tracing: span and trace. A span represents
a single operation in a trace. A span can represent an HTTP request, a remote
procedure call (RPC), a database query, or even the path that your code takes. A
trace is a tree of spans showing the path of work through a system. You can
distinguish a trace on its own by a unique 16-byte sequence called a TraceID.
