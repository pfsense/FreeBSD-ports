File::Copy::Recursive::Reduced is intended as a not-quite-drop-in replacement
for certain functionality provided by CPAN distribution File-Copy-Recursive. The
library provides methods similar enough to that distribution's fcopy(),
dircopy() and rcopy() functions to be usable in those CPAN distributions often
described as being part of the Perl toolchain.
