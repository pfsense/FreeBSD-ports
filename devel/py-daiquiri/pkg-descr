Daiquiri is a Python library that simplifies the configuration and usage of
Python's built-in logging module. It provides an easy-to-use interface for
setting up basic logging functionalities, often with a single call to
`daiquiri.setup()`.

Key features include:
- Flexible output options: logs to stderr (with colored output), syslog, systemd
  journal, or files.
- Custom formatters: supports plain text and structured JSON logs.
- Enhanced logger: allows passing keyword arguments to logging methods, which
  become part of the log record.
- Warning handling: overrides Python's default warning behavior to log warnings
  via the logging system.
- Exception handling: integrates with `sys.excepthook` to automatically log
  uncaught exceptions.
