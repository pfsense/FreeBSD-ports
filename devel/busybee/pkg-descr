BusyBee provides a messaging abstraction on top of TCP sockets.

BusyBee is a refined version of the HyperDex event loop.  It exposes a
"messaging" abstraction on top of TCP and automatically packs/unpacks messages
on the wire.  At the core of BusyBee is a thread-safe event loop that enables
multiple threads to send and receive messages concurrently.
