eventlib is an asynchronous event tracking app for Django. This library was
built upon the following values:
- It must be deadly simple to log an event
- It must be possible to track each event in different ways
- Each different "event handler" must be completely separate and fail gracefully
- The event system must be asynchronous, so let's use celery
- The library must be extensible
- 100% of test coverage is enough
