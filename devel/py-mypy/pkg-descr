Mypy is an optional static type checker for Python that aims to combine the
benefits of dynamic (or "duck") typing and static typing. Mypy combines the
expressive power and convenience of Python with a powerful type system and
compile-time type checking. Mypy type checks standard Python programs; run them
using any Python VM with basically no runtime overhead.
