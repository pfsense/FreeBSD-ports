mando is a wrapper around argparse, and allows you to write complete CLI
applications in seconds while maintaining all the flexibility.

While argparse is great for simple command line applications with only
one, default command, when you have to add multiple commands and manage them
things get really messy and long. But don't worry, mando comes to help!

Features:
* Create complete CLI applications with decorators
* Supports multiple commands and subcommands
* Automatic help generation from docstrings
* Type annotations support for Python 3
* Sphinx, Google, and NumPy docstring styles
* Shell autocompletion via argcomplete package
* Custom format classes support
