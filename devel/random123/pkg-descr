The Random123 library is a collection of counter-based random number generators
( "CBRNGs") for CPUs (C and C++) and GPUs (CUDA and OpenCL), as described in
Parallel Random Numbers: As Easy as 1, 2, 3, Salmon, Moraes, Dror & Shaw, SC11,
Seattle, Washington, USA, 2011, ACM . They are intended for use in statistical
applications and Monte Carlo simulation and have passed all of the rigorous
SmallCrush, Crush and BigCrush tests in the extensive TestU01 suite of
statistical tests for random number generators. They are not suitable for use in
cryptography or security even though they are constructed using principles drawn
from cryptography.
