The goal of 'pak' is to make package installation faster and more reliable. In
particular, it performs all HTTP operations in parallel, so metadata resolution
and package downloads are fast. Metadata and package files are cached on the
local disk as well. 'pak' has a dependency solver, so it finds version
conflicts before performing the installation. This version of 'pak' supports
CRAN, 'Bioconductor' and 'GitHub' packages as well.
