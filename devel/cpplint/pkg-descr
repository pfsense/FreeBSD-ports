Cpplint is a command-line tool to check C/C++ files for style issues following
Google's C++ style guide. Cpplint is developed and maintained by Google Inc. at
google/styleguide <https://github.com/google/styleguide>, also see the wikipedia
entry <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cpplint>.

While Google maintains cpplint, Google is not (very) responsive to issues and
pull requests, this fork aims to be (somewhat) more open to add fixes to cpplint
to enable fixes, when those fixes make cpplint usable in wider contexts.
