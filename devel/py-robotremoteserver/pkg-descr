Robot Framework remote servers allow hosting test libraries on different
processes or machines than Robot Framework itself is running on. This
version is implemented in Python and supports also Jython (JVM) and
IronPython (.NET). See remote library interface documentation for more
information about the remote interface in general as well as for a list
of remote server implementations in other programming languages.
