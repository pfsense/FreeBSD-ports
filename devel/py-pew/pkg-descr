Python Env Wrapper is a set of commands to manage multiple virtual environments.
Pew can create, delete and copy your environments, using a single command to
switch to them wherever you are, while keeping them in a single (configurable)
location.

Virtualenvs makes it easier to work on more than one project at a time without
introducing conflicts in their dependencies.

Pew is completely shell-agnostic and thus works on bash, zsh, fish, powershell,
etc.
