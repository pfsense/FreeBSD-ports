Gorm allows developers to quickly create graphical applications and to design
every little aspect of the application's user interface.

Using drag and drop all types of objects like menus, buttons, tables, lists
and browsers are easily added to the interface. With just the mouse you can
resize, move or convert the objects or connect them to functions as well as
edit nearly every aspect of them using Gorm's powerful inspectors.

With its intuitive interface Gorm makes creating, editing and testing complex
user interfaces a piece of cake.
