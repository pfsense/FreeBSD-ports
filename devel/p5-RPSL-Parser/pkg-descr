This is a rather simplistic lexer and tokenizer for the RPSL language.

It currently does not validate the object in any way, it just tries
(rather hard) to grab the biggest ammount of information it can from the
text presented and place it in a Parse Tree (that can be passed to other
objects from the RPSL namespace for validation and more RFC2622 related
functionality).
