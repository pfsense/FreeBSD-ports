Simian (Similarity Analyser) identifies duplication in Java, C#,
C, C++, COBOL, Ruby, JSP, ASP, HTML, XML, Visual Basic Groovy source
code and even plain text files. In fact, simian can be used on any
human readable files such as ini files, deployment descriptors, you
name it.

Note: The port uses the java version by default. You can select the .NET
      version via WITH_MONO=yes, and disable installation of the
      java parts with WITHOUT_JAVA=yes.
