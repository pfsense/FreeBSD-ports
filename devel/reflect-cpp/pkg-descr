reflect-cpp is a C++-20 library for fast serialization, deserialization and
validation using reflection, similar to pydantic in Python, serde in Rust,
encoding in Go or aeson in Haskell.

reflect-cpp fills an important gap in C++ development. It minimizes boilerplate
code and enhances code safety for seamless and efficient data exchange across
system components.

Design principles for reflect-cpp include:

- Close integration with containers from the C++ standard library
- Close adherence to C++ idioms
- Out-of-the-box support for JSON
- Simple installation
- Simple extendability to other serialization formats
- Simple extendability to custom classes
- Being one of the fastest serialization libraries in existence, as demonstrated
  by our benchmarks

reflect-cpp is not just a reflection library, it is for serialization,
deserialization and validation through reflection.
