loccount is a re-implementation of David A. Wheeler's sloccount tool
in Go. It is faster, handles more different languages, can report LLOC
as well as SLOC, and can do COCOMO II as well as COCOMO I estimates. Because
it's one source file in Go, it is easier to maintain and extend than the
multi-file, multi-language implementation of the original.

The algorithms are largely unchanged and can be expected to produce
identical numbers for languages supported by both tools. Python is
an exception; loccount corrects buggy counting of single-quote multiline
literals in sloccount 2.26.
