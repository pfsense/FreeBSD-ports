erlang-native-compiler, or enc, as it is installed, is an Erlang build
tool that makes it easy to compile erlang NIFs - native interface
functions - in rebar3 and mix projects, handling the port compiler
options that rebar and rebar2 provided, but were subsequently removed
from rebar3 and not included in mix itself.

enc is a self-contained Erlang script, so it's easy to distribute
or even embed directly in a project.
