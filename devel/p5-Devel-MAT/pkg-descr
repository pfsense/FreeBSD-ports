A Devel::MAT instance loads a heapdump file, and provides a container to store
analysis tools to work on it. Tools may be provided that conform to the
Devel::MAT::Tool API, which can help analyse the data and interact with the
explorer user interface by using the methods in the Devel::MAT::UI package.
