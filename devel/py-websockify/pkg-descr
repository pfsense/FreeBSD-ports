websockify was formerly named wsproxy and was part of the noVNC project.

At the most basic level, websockify just translates WebSockets traffic to normal
socket traffic. Websockify accepts the WebSockets handshake, parses it, and then
begins forwarding traffic between the client and the target in both directions.
