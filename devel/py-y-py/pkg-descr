Ypy is a Python binding for Y-CRDT. It provides distributed data types that
enable real-time collaboration between devices. Ypy can sync data with any other
platform that has a Y-CRDT binding, allowing for seamless cross-domain
communication. The library is a thin wrapper around Yrs, taking advantage of the
safety and performance of Rust.
