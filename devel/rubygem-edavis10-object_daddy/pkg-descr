Object Daddy is a library (as well as a Ruby on Rails plugin) designed to
assist in automating testing of large collections of objects, especially webs
of ActiveRecord models. It is a descendent of the "Object Mother" pattern for
creating objects for testing, and is related to the concept of an "object
exemplar" or stereotype. This is a fork of the original object_daddy.
