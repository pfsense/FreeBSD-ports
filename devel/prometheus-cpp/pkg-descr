This library aims to enable Metrics-Driven Development for C++ services.

It implements the Prometheus Data Model, a powerful abstraction on which
to collect and expose metrics. We offer the possibility for metrics to
be collected by Prometheus, but other push/pull collections can be added
as plugins.
