Thread::Local provides a simple high level interface for per-class thread
locals. Implements a standard interface for "shared global state". It avoids
reinventing thread-local semantics in your own code by using this
implementation.

Features:
- Convert global state to thread local state easily.
- Avoid race conditions and data corruption.
- Provides a standard interface for policy driven design.
