Struct::Dumb creates record-like structure types, similar to the struct keyword
in C, C++ or C#, or Record in Pascal. An invocation of this module will create a
construction function which returns new object references with the given field
values. These references all respond to lvalue methods that access or modify the
values stored.

It's specifically and intentionally not meant to be an object class. You cannot
subclass it. You cannot provide additional methods. You cannot apply roles or
mixins or metaclasses or traits or antlers or whatever else is in fashion this
week.

On the other hand, it is tiny, creates cheap lightweight array-backed
structures, uses nothing outside of core. It's intended simply to be a slightly
nicer way to store data structures, where otherwise you might be tempted to
abuse a hash, complete with the risk of typoing key names. The constructor will
croak if passed the wrong number of arguments, as will attempts to refer to
fields that don't exist.
