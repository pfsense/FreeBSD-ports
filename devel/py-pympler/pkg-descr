Pympler is a development tool to measure, monitor and analyze the memory
behavior of Python objects in a running Python application.

By pympling a Python application, detailed insight in the size and the lifetime
of Python objects can be obtained. Undesirable or unexpected runtime behavior
like memory bloat and other "pymples" can easily be identified.
