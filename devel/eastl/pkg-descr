EASTL stands for Electronic Arts Standard Template Library. It is a C++ template
library of containers, algorithms, and iterators useful for runtime and tool
development across multiple platforms. It is a fairly extensive and robust
implementation of such a library and has an emphasis on high performance above
all other considerations.
