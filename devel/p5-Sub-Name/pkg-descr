The subname() function exported by this module allows one to assign new
names to Perl subroutine.  This is different from glob-assignment, since
the name is only used for informational purposes (caller, Carp, etc.).

Note that for anonymous closures (subs that reference lexicals declared
outside the sub itself) one can name each instance of the closure
differently, which can be very useful for debugging.
