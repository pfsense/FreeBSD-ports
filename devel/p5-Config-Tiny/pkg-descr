Config::Tiny is a perl class to read and write .ini style configuration
files with as little code as possible, reducing load time and memory
overhead.  Memory usage is normally scoffed at in Perl, but in my
opinion should be at least kept in mind.

This module is primarily for reading human written files, and anything
we write shouldn't need to have documentation/comments.  If you need
something with more power, move up to Config::Simple, Config::General or
one of the many other Config:: modules.
