Provides a lightweight (zero-dependency) and easy to use unit testing
framework. Main features: install tests with the package. Test results are
treated as data that can be stored and manipulated. Test files are R scripts
interspersed with test commands, that can be programmed over. Fully automated
build-install-test sequence for packages. Skip tests when not run locally (e.g.
on CRAN). Flexible and configurable output printing. Compare computed output
with output stored with the package. Run tests in parallel. Extensible by other
packages. Report side effects.
