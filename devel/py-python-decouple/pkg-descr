Decouple helps you to organize your settings so that you can change parameters
without having to redeploy your app.

It also makes it easy for you to:

* store parameters in ini or .env files;
* define comprehensive default values;
* properly convert values to the correct data type;
* have only one configuration module to rule all your instances.
* It was originally designed for Django, but became an independent generic too
  for separating settings from code.

Import the config object:

from decouple import config

Retrieve the configuration parameters:

SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY')
DEBUG = config('DEBUG', default=False, cast=bool)
EMAIL_HOST = config('EMAIL_HOST', default='localhost')
EMAIL_PORT = config('EMAIL_PORT', default=25, cast=int)
