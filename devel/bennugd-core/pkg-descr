Bennu is a high level open source game development suite which
focuses on modularity and portability, making it a perfect choice
for cross-platform game development.

Although officialy it is only supported on Windows, Linux and GP2X
Wiz (on the right), Bennu can run on multiple other platforms,
including *BSD, MacOSX and other consoles such as the Wii, Dingoo
A320, GP2X, or the classic Xbox.

This makes it really fun to code in Bennu: the game can be played
on you computer AND your console!
