LibStroke is a stroke translation library. Strokes are motions of
the mouse that can be interpreted by a program as a command. Strokes
are used extensively in CAD programs. I fell in love with them when
I was using the CAD tools that use a stroke interface to select
tools or perform actions. I wrote this library so that others can
see how useful strokes can be and so that more programs take
advantage of this extremely natural human-computer interface.
