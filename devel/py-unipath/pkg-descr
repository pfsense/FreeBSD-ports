Unipath is an object-oriented front end to the file/directory functions
scattered throughout several Python library modules.

It's based on Jason Orendorff's path.py but does not adhere as strictly to the
underlying functions' syntax, in order to provide more user convenience and
higher-level functionality.

Unipath is stable, well-tested, and has been used in production since 2008.
