Essentially, this module is a very optimized version of Clone::More.
By taking advantage of one of Clone::More's 'OPTIMIZATION_HACKS' as
well as removing all the Pure Perl from the More.pm, I was able to
gain a lot of speed out of the module. Essentially, though, the core
of the module is exactly as that of Clone::More.

You will see that by using Benchmark::cmpthese, I ran a simple
comparison between Storable::dclone, Clone::More::clone, and
Clone::Fast::clone. You will (should) begin to see the reason why I
loaded this module along side of Clone::More.

		   Rate    Storable Clone::More Clone::Fast
    Storable     7552/s          --        -39%        -59%
    Clone::More 12400/s         64%          --        -33%
    Clone::Fast 18442/s        144%         49%          --

For more information relative to the DESCRIPTION of this module, I
recommend peeking into the POD written for Clone::More (I took more
time with it ;) )
