Provides a strace/truss-like runtime call monitor for Perl applications.
Note that, while strace/truss only dumps system calls, Devel::STrace
dumps all calls to Perl subs on the application's stack.  Also note that
Devel::STrace cannot trace non-Perl calls (e.g., calls inside XS/C
modules), so an additional external strace/truss monitor may be needed
to fully diagnose a misbehaving Perl script.
