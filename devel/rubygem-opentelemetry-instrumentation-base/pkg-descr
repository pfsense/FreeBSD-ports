OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Base contains the instrumentation base class, and
the instrumentation registry. These modules provide a common interface to
support the installation of auto instrumentation libraries. The instrumentation
base is responsible for adding itself to the instrumentation registry as well as
providing convenience hooks for the installation process. The instrumentation
registry contains all the instrumentation to be installed during the SDK
configuration process.
