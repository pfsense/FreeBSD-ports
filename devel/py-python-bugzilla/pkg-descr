This is a python module that provides a kinda pythonic interface to Bugzilla
over XMLRPC.

It was originally written specifically for Red Hat's Bugzilla instance, but
it is intended to work with any Bugzilla instance. More usage the better, we
would be happy to help get things working with the bugzilla instance you care
about.

It also includes a `bugzilla` command-line client which can be used for quick,
ad-hoc bugzilla jiggery-pokery.
