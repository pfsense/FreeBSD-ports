msitools is a set of programs to inspect and build Windows Installer (.MSI)
files. It is based on libmsi, a portable library to read and write .MSI files.
libmsi in turn is a port of (and a subset of) Wine's implementation of the
Windows Installer.

msitools plans to be a solution for packaging and deployment of cross-compiled
Windows applications.
