libsimdpp is a portable header-only zero-overhead C++ wrapper around
single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) intrinsics found in many compilers.
The library presents a single interface over several instruction sets in
such a way that the same source code may be compiled for different instruction
sets. The resulting object files then may be hooked into internal dynamic
dispatch mechanism.
