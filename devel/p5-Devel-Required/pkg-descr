The Devel::Required module only serves a purpose in the development
environment of an author of a CPAN module (or more precisely: a user of the
ExtUtils::MakeMaker module). It makes sure that any changes to the required
modules specified in the Makefile.PL are automatically reflected in the
appropriate text file and in the appropriate source files (either
explicitly or implicitly specified).

It takes the information given with the PREREQ_PM parameter and by default
writes this to the README file, as well as to the POD of the file specified
with the VERSION_FROM parameter. Both these defaults can be overridden with
the "text" and "pod" parameters in the use Devel::Required specification.
