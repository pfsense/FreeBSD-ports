This is a simple diff tool that cleans up jupyter notebooks, transforming each
notebook into a readable markdown file, keeping the output of cells, and
running the diff after. Markdowns are generated using an opinionated Jupyter
to Markdown conversion. This means that the entire file is readable on the diff.
