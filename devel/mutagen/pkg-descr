Mutagen is a fast, continuous, multidirectional file synchronization tool. It
can safely, scalably, and efficiently synchronize filesystem contents between
arbitrary pairs of locations in near real-time. Support is currently implemented
for locations on local filesystems, SSH-accessible filesystems, and Docker
container filesystems.

Mutagen is designed specifically to support remote development scenarios, with
configurable behaviors specifically designed to help developers edit code
locally while building, running, or packaging it in a remote environment.
