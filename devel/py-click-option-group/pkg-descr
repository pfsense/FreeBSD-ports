click-option-group is a Click-extension package that adds option groups missing
in Click.

Click is a package for creating powerful and beautiful command line interfaces
(CLI) in Python, but it has no the functionality for creating option groups.

Option groups are convenient mechanism for logical structuring CLI, also it
allows you to set the specific behavior and set the relationship among grouped
options (mutually exclusive options for example). Moreover, argparse stdlib
package contains this functionality out of the box.

At the same time, many Click users need this functionality. You can read
interesting discussions about it in the issues 257, 373, 509 and 1137.

The aim of this package is to provide group options with extensible
functionality using canonical and clean API (Click-like API as far as possible).
