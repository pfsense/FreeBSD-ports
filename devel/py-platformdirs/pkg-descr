When writing desktop application, finding the right location to store user data
and configuration varies per platform. Even for single-platform apps, there may
by plenty of nuances in figuring out the right location.

This kind of thing is what the platformdirs module is for. platformdirs will
help you choose an appropriate:
- user data dir (user_data_dir)
- user config dir (user_config_dir)
- user cache dir (user_cache_dir)
- site data dir (site_data_dir)
- site config dir (site_config_dir)
- user log dir (user_log_dir)
- user runtime dir (user_runtime_dir)

And also:
- Is a single module so other Python packages can vendor their own private copy.
- Is slightly opinionated on the directory names used. Look for "OPINION" in
  documentation and code for when an opinion is being applied.
