Date::Extract takes an arbitrary block of text, searches it for
something that looks like a date string, and builds a DateTime object
out of it.  By design it will produce few false positives. This means
it will not catch nearly everything that looks like a date string. So
if you have the string "do homework for class 2019" it won't return a
DateTime object with the year set to 2019.
