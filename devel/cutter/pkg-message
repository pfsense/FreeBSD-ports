Please note that code-coverage is not fully supported on FreeBSD and
cutter will crash when used to generate a report.  The problem has been
reported upstream and no fix is available ATM. However, a workaround has
been found: adding the '--keep-opening-modules' argument to cutter's
command-line circumvents the problem.
