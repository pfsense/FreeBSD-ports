DEPOT is a framework for easily storing and serving files in web applications.

DEPOT supports storing files in multiple backends, like:
- Local Disk
- In Memory (for tests)
- On GridFS
- On Amazon S3 (or compatible services)
and integrates with database by providing files attached to your SQLAlchemy or
Ming/MongoDB models with respect to transactions behaviours (files are rolled
back too).
