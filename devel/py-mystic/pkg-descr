The mystic framework provides a collection of optimization algorithms and tools
that allows the user to more robustly (and easily) solve hard optimization
problems. All optimization algorithms included in mystic provide workflow at the
fitting layer, not just access to the algorithms as function calls. mystic gives
the user fine-grained power to both monitor and steer optimizations as the fit
processes are running. Optimizers can advance one iteration with Step, or run to
completion with Solve. Users can customize optimizer stop conditions, where both
compound and user-provided conditions may be used. Optimizers can save state,
can be reconfigured dynamically, and can be restarted from a saved solver or
from a results file. All solvers can also leverage parallel computing, either
within each iteration or as an ensemble of solvers.
