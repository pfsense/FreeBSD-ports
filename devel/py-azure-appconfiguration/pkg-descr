Azure App Configuration is a managed service that helps developers centralize
their application configurations simply and securely.

Modern programs, especially programs running in a cloud, generally have many
components that are distributed in nature. Spreading configuration settings
across these components can lead to hard-to-troubleshoot errors during an
application deployment. Use App Configuration to securely store all the
settings for your application in one place.
