Data::ObjectDriver is an object relational mapper, meaning that it
maps object-oriented design concepts onto a relational database.

It's inspired by, and descended from, the MT::ObjectDriver classes in
Six Apart's Movable Type and TypePad weblogging products. But it adds
in caching and partitioning layers, allowing you to spread data across
multiple physical databases, without your application code needing to
know where the data is stored.

It's currently considered ALPHA code. The API is largely fixed, but
may seen some small changes in the future. For what it's worth, the
likeliest area for changes are in the syntax for the search method,
and would most likely not break much in the way of backwards
compatibility.
