Metrics::Any provides a central location for modules to report monitoring
metrics, such as counters of the number of times interesting events have
happened, and programs to collect up and send those metrics to monitoring
services.

Inspired by Log::Any, this module splits the overall problem into two sides.
Modules wishing to provide metrics for monitoring purposes can use the use
Metrics::Any statement to obtain a collector into which they can report metric
events. By default this collector doesn't actually do anything, so modules can
easily use it without adding extra specific dependencies for specific reporting.

A program using one or more such modules can apply a different policy and
request a particular adapter implementation in order to actually report these
metrics to some external system, by using the use Metrics::Any::Adapter
statement.

This separation of concerns allows module authors to write code which will
report metrics without needing to care about the exact mechanism of that
reporting (as well as to write code which does not itself depend on the code
required to perform that reporting).
