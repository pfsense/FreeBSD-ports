iniparse is a INI parser for Python which is:
- Compatible with ConfigParser: Backward compatible implementations of
  ConfigParser, RawConfigParser, and SafeConfigParser are included that are
  API-compatible with the Python standard library.
- Preserves structure of INI files: Order of sections & options, indentation,
  comments, and blank lines are preserved as far as possible when data is
  updated.
- More convenient: Values can be accessed using dotted notation (cfg.user.name),
  or using container syntax (cfg['user']['name']).

It is very useful for config files that are updated both by users and by
programs, since it is very disorienting for a user to have her config file
completely rearranged whenever a program changes it. iniparse also allows making
the order of entries in a config file significant, which is desirable in
applications like image galleries.
