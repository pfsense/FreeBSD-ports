Clixon is a CLI/network interfaced configuration database tool

Using Clixon you can create CLI, RESTCONF, and NETCONF interfaces to manage a
configuration database. It also provides the mechanism to validate and configure
system components.

clixon 4.3 is a large upgrade from earlier versions, notably it is much stricter
about the validity of XML and api-paths. Please see the CHANGELOG that can be
found at https://github.com/clicon/clixon/blob/release-4.3/CHANGELOG.md
