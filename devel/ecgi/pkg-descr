ecgi (easy CGI Libary) is an ANSI C library for the creation of
CGI-based Web applications. It transparently supports the CGI methods
GET and POST, and also multipart/form-data file uploads. The user
interface is designed to be as easy as possible and maintains full
compatibility to cgic 0.5.

It also contains a library independent introduction to CGI programming
with C, an .html to .h HTML template preprocessor, and fast,
block-allocating memory files.
