Makefun helps you create functions dynamically, with the signature of your
choice. It was largely inspired by decorator and functools, and created mainly
to cover some of their limitations.

The typical use cases are:
  * creating signature-preserving function wrappers - just like functools.wraps
  but with accurate TypeError exception raising when user-provided arguments are
  wrong, and with a very convenient way to access argument values.

  * creating function wrappers that have more or less arguments that the
  function they wrap. A bit like functools.partial but a lot more flexible and
  friendly for your users. For example, I use it in my pytest plugins to add a
  requests parameter to users' tests or fixtures when they do not already have
  it.

  * more generally, creating functions with a signature derived from a reference
  signature, or even creating functions with a signature completely defined at
  runtime.
