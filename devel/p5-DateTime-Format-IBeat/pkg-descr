No Time Zones
No Geographical Borders

How long is a Swatch .beat? In short, we have divided up the virtual and real
day into 1000 beats. One Swatch beat is the equivalent of 1 minute 26.4
seconds. That means that 12 noon in the old time system is the equivalent of
@500 Swatch .beats.

We are not just creating a new way of measuring time, we are also creating a
new meridian in Biel, Switzerland, home of Swatch.

Biel MeanTime (BMT) is the universal reference for Internet Time. A day in
Internet Time begins at midnight BMT (@000 Swatch .beats) (Central European
Wintertime). The meridian is marked for all to see on the facade of the Swatch
International Headquarters on Jakob-Staempfli Street, Biel, Switzerland.  So,
it is the same time all over the world, be it night or day, the era of time
zones has disappeared.
