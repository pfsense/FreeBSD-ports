YACS is a lightweight library to define and manage system configurations, such
as those commonly found in software designed for scientific experimentation.

These "configurations" typically cover concepts like hyperparameters used in
training a machine learning model or configurable model hyperparameters, such
as the depth of a convolutional neural network.
