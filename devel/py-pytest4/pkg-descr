The pytest testing tool makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to
support complex functional testing.

Features:

  * Detailed info on failing assert statements
  * Auto-discovery of test modules and functions
  * Modular fixtures to manage small or parametrized long-lived test resources
  * Can run unittest (or trial), nose test suites out of the box
  * Rich plugin architecture, with over 315+ external plugins
