Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework for developers
using C++ or QML, a CSS/JavaScript-like language.

The Qt 5 Core Compat module contains the Qt Core APIs which will be no longer
supported in Qt 6 and therefore were removed from Qt 6. The module is provided
to facilitate the transition to Qt 6.
