The SonarScanner for Ant provides a task to allow integration of SonarQube
analysis into an Apache Ant build script.

The SonarQube Scanner for Ant is an Ant Task that is wrapper of SonarQube
Scanner, which works by invoking SonarQube Scanner and passing to it all
properties named following a sonar.* convention. This has the downside of not
being very Ant-y, but the upside of providing instant availability of any new
analysis parameter introduced by a new version of a plugin or of SonarQube
itself.
