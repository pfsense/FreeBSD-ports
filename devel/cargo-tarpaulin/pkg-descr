Tarpaulin is a code coverage reporting tool for the Cargo build system, named
for a waterproof cloth used to cover cargo on a ship. Currently, tarpaulin
provides working line coverage and while fairly reliable may still contain
minor inaccuracies in the results. A lot of work has been done to get it
working on a wide range of projects, but often unique combinations of packages
and build features can cause issues so please report anything
you find that's wrong. Also, check out our roadmap for planned features.
