This module parses the most common forms of ISO 8601 date strings
(e.g. 2007-01-14T20:34:22+00:00) into datetime objects.

You can parse full date + times, or just the date. In both cases a datetime
instance is returned but with missing times defaulting to 0, and missing
days / months defaulting to 1.
