This Python module returns a tzinfo object with the local timezone
information under Unix and Win-32. It requires pytz, and returns pytz
tzinfo objects.

This module attempts to fix a glaring hole in pytz, that there is no way
to get the local timezone information, unless you know the zoneinfo
name, and under several Linux distros that's hard or impossible to
figure out.
