shell-toolbox is a collection of shell script development tools.

Currently, the only included script is "shell", which is useful for testing
things in an interactive environment other than your usual shell, or for
testing things in a clean environment with automatic cleanup of any files left
behind.

It creates a "temporary interactive shell" with a temporary working directory
(unless the "-d" flag is used to specify an existing directory) and clean
environment.  The working directory is removed when the shell exits
(unless the "-k" or "-d" flag was used).

The temporary working directory may also be pre-populated with the
contents of an existing directory (using the "-s" flag).

See "man 1 shell" after installation.
