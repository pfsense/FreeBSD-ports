The gettext lint tools is a collection of tools for checking the validity and
consistency of PO and POT files. It also includes an experimental glossary
building tool.

This package includes:
    * POFileStatus - PO file validator and status reporting
    * POFileChecker - searches for common mistakes in PO files
    * POTFileChecker - searches for common mistakes in POT files
    * POFileConsistency - PO file consistency checks
    * POFileConsistencyShell - PO file consistency checks, interactive mode
    * POFileEquiv - PO file glossary generator

All tools generate XML to the standard output; just run them with a list of PO
or POT files to check. Some have extra options, run the command with no
parameters for a short usage message.
