You installed RStudio: Integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

Please note that RStudio requires /proc to be mounted.

The usual way to do this is to add this line to /etc/fstab:
proc /proc procfs rw 0 0

and then run this command as root:
# mount /proc

In order to enable RStudio Server service at startup and start it please run:
# sysrc rstudio_server_enable="YES"
# service rstudio-server start
and then navigate to http://localhost:8787/ in your browser.

You can also start the RStudio Server service once with:
# service rstudio-server onestart
and then navigate to http://localhost:8787/ in your browser.


Workaround for the path bug in RStudio Server
(https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/8939):
- In order to be able to install R packages from RStudio Server you
- need to first correct the path by executing this command in the
- 'Console' tab (in the RStudio Server running in your browser):

Sys.setenv(PATH = paste("/usr/local/bin:",Sys.getenv("PATH"), sep=""))
