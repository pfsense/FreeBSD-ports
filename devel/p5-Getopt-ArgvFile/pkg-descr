Module Getopt::ArgvFile is a simple supplement to other option
handling modules.  It allows script options and parameters to be
read from files instead of from the command line by interpolating
file contents into @ARGV. This way it PREPARES the final option
handling.

Getopt::ArgvFile does NOT perform any option processing itself, and
should work fine together with any other option handling module
(e.g. Getopt::Long) or even self coded option handling.
