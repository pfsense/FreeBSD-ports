Need an obsolete Phobos module? Here they are, back from the dead and upgraded
to work with the latest D.

modules included:

  * std.bitarray
  * std.date
  * std.datebase
  * std.dateparse
  * std.regexp
  * std.signals
  * std.stream and friends
  * std.xml

Some individual functions have been moved here rather than full Phobos modules.
They are:

  * undead.doformat: Contains the doFormat function from std.format
  * undead.string: Contains regex style pattern matching functions from
    std.string
