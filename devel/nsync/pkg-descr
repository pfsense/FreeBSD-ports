Nsync is a C library that exports various synchronization primitives.
The library is intended to be portable, and to be compilable on a system with
only a C90 compiler, assuming atomic operations are available from the
compiler, operating system, or assembler routines.  It is able to use C11 or
C++11 atomic operations if they are available.
