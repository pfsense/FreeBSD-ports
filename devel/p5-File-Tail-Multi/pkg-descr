Derived from MultiTail, this perl library makes it easy to tail a dynamic
list of files and match/except lines using full regular expressions and
even maintains their state locally.

File::Tail::Multi will tail multiple files and return the records read
to a Data Structure. The Data Structure can be processed by
File::Tail::Multi functions.
