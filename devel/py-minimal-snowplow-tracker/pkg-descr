Add analytics to your Python apps and Python games with the Snowplow event
tracker for Python.

With this tracker you can collect event data from your Python-based
applications, games or Python web servers/frameworks.

This is a fork of the original Snowplow Python tracker v0.8.0, with a number of
changes:
- All emitters except for the basic one removed
- Tests converted to docker
- All tracking event methods except for structured/unstructured removed
- Python 3.7 supported
