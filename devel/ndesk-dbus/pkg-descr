This is a C# implementation of D-Bus. It's often referred to as "managed
D-Bus" to avoid confusion with existing bindings (which wrap libdbus).

D-Bus is an inter-process communication framework that lets applications
interface with the system event bus as well as allowing them to talk to
one another in a peer-to-peer configuration.
