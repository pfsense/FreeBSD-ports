xeus is a library meant to facilitate the implementation of kernels for Jupyter.
It takes the burden of implementing the Jupyter Kernel protocol so developers
can focus on implementing the interpreter part of the kernel.

An example of kernel built with xeus is xeus-cling, a kernel for the C++
programming language based on the cling C++ interpreter.
