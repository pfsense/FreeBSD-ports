To use Test2::Harness you use the yath command. Yath will find the tests (or use
the ones you specify), and run them. As it runs it will output diagnostics
information such as failures. At the end yath will print a summary of the test
run.

The canonical source of up-to-date command options are the help output when
using $ yath help and $ yath help COMMAND.

yath can be thought of as a more powerful alternative to prove (Test::Harness).
