HVM2 is a h=Higher-order Virtual Machine 2.

HVM2 is a massively parallel interaction combinator evaluator.

By compiling programs from high-level languages (such as Python and Haskell) to
HVM, one can run these languages directly on massively parallel hardware, like
GPUs, with near-ideal speedup.

HVM2 is the successor to HVM1, a 2022 prototype of this concept. Compared to its
predecessor, HVM2 is simpler, faster and, most importantly, more correct. HOC
provides long-term support for all features listed on its paper.
