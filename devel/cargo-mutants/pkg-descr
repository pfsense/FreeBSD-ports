cargo-mutants helps you improve your program's quality by finding places where
bugs could be inserted without causing any tests to fail.

Coverage measurements can be helpful, but they really tell you what code is
reached by a test, and not whether the test really checks anything about the
behavior of the code. Mutation tests give different information, about whether
the tests really check the code's behavior.

The goal of cargo-mutants is to be easy to run on any Rust source tree, and
to tell you something interesting about areas where bugs might be lurking or
the tests might be insufficient.
