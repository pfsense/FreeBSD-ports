FFI::CheckLib checks whether a particular dynamic library is available for FFI
to use. It is modeled heavily on Devel::CheckLib, but will find dynamic
libraries even when development packages are not installed. It also provides a
find_lib function that will return the full path to the found dynamic library,
which can be feed directly into FFI::Platypus or FFI::Raw.

Although intended mainly for FFI modules via FFI::Platypus and similar, this
module does not actually use any FFI to do its detection and probing. This
module does not have any non-core runtime dependencies. The test suite does
depend on Test2::Suite.
