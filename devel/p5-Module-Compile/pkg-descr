This module provides a system for writing modules that *compile* other
Perl modules.

Modules that use these compilation modules get compiled into some
altered form the first time they are run. The result is cached into
".pmc" files.

Perl has native support for ".pmc" files. It always checks for them,
before loading a ".pm" file.
