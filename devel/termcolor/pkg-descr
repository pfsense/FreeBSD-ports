Termcolor is a header-only C++ library for printing colored messages to the
terminal. Written just for fun with a help of the Force. Termcolor uses ANSI
color formatting, so you can use it on every system that is used such terminals
(most *nix systems, including Linux and Mac OS). On Windows, WinAPI is used
instead but some limitations are applied.
