AsmJit is a complete JIT and AOT assembler for C++ language. It can generate
native code for x86 and x64 architectures and supports the whole x86/x64
instruction set - from legacy MMX to the newest AVX512. It has a type-safe API
that allows C++ compiler to do semantic checks at compile-time even before the
assembled code is generated and/or executed.
