Test::Auto aims to provide, a standard for documenting Perl 5 software projects,
a framework writing tests, test automation, and documentation generation.

This framework lets you write documentation in test files using pod-like comment
blocks. By using a particular set of comment blocks (the specification) this
framework can run certain kinds of tests automatically. For example, we can
automatically ensure that the package the test is associated with is loadable,
that the test file comment blocks meet the specification, that any super-classes
or libraries are loadable, and that the functions, methods, and routines are
properly documented.
