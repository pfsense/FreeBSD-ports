Game of Trees (Got) is a version control system which prioritizes
ease of use and simplicity over flexibility.

Got uses Git repositories to store versioned data. Git can be used
for any functionality which has not yet been implemented in Got.
It will always remain possible to work with both Got and Git on the
same repository.
