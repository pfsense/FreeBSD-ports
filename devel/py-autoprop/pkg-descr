Properties are a feature in python that allow accessor functions (i.e. getters
and setters) to masquerade as regular attributes. This makes it possible to
provide transparent APIs for classes that need to cache results, lazily load
data, maintain invariants, or react in any other way to attribute access.

Unfortunately, making a property requires an annoying amount of boilerplate
code. There are a few ways to do it, but the most common and most succinct
requires you to decorate two functions (with two different decorators) and
to type the name of the attribute three times:
