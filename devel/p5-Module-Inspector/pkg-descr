Module::Inspector provides a wrapper around various modules used to read and
examine the different parts of a Perl module distribution tarball, and can
inspect a module unrolled on disk, in a repository checkout, or just look
directly inside a tarball. It also rovides a companion to the Class::Inspector
API for accessing information on class after installation.
