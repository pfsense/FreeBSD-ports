Squint is a simple query interface for tabular data that's light-weight and easy
to learn. A core feature of Squint is that the structure of a query's selection
determines the structure of its result. With it you can:
- Select data using Python literals -- sets, lists, dictionaries, etc. -- and
  get results in the same format.
- Aggregate, map, filter, reduce, and otherwise manipulate data.
- Lazily iterate over results, write them to a file, or eagerly evaluate them in
  memory.
- Analyze data from CSV, Excel, SQL, and other data sources.
