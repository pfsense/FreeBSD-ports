HTML_Template_IT is a templating engine designed to allow easy separation of
concerns. It does this by clearly separating the presentational code from the
PHP code. The presentation code may be of any format, however generally XML or
HTML is used.

This engine works on the foundation of blocks and placeholders. It uses the
hierarchy of blocks to determine which presentational code is instantiated when
blocks are parsed. The placeholders allow the insertion of "dynamic"
information.

There are two classes to use for templating. HTML_Template_IT is used for basic
templating needs. HTML_Template_ITX gives you full power over the templating
engine, allowing blocks to be added, and function callbacks to be used.
