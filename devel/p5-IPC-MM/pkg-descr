IPC::MM provides an interface to Ralf Engelschall's mm library, allowing
memory to be shared between multiple processes in a relatively
convenient way.

IPC::MM provides methods to create and destroy shared memory segments and
to access data structures within those shared memory segments, as well
as miscellaneous methods.  Additionally, it provides a tied interface
for scalars and hashes.
