This library contains functionality for parsing and pretty-printing
S-expressions. In addition to that it contains an extremely useful
preprocessing module for Camlp4, which can be used to automatically
generate code from type definitions for efficiently converting
OCaml-values to S-expressions and vice versa. In combination with the
parsing and pretty-printing functionality this frees the user from
having to write his own I/O-routines for data structures he defines.
Possible errors during automatic conversions from S-expressions to
OCaml-values are reported in a very human-readable way. Another module
in the library allows you to extract and replace sub-expressions in
S-expressions.
