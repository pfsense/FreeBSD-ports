FunctionalPlus is a small header-only library supporting you in reducing code
noise and in dealing with only one single level of abstraction at a time. By
increasing brevity and maintainability of your code it can improve productivity
in the long run. It pursues these goals by providing pure and easy-to-use
functions that free you from implementing commonly used flows of control over
and over again.
