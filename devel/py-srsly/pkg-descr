This package bundles some of the best Python serialization libraries into one
standalone package, with a high-level API that makes it easy to write code
that's correct across platforms and Pythons. This allows us to provide all the
serialization utilities we need in a single binary wheel. Currently supports
JSON, JSONL, MessagePack, Pickle and YAML.
