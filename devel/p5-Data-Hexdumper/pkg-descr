Data::Hexdumper provides a simple way to format and display arbitrary binary
data in a way similar to how some debuggers do for lesser languages. It
gives the programmer a considerable degree of flexibility in how the data is
formatted, with sensible defaults. It is envisaged that it will primarily be
of use for those wrestling alligators in the swamp of binary file formats,
which is why it was written in the first place.
