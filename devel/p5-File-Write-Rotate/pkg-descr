File::Write::Rotate can be used to write to file, usually for logging, that can
rotate itself. File will be opened in append mode. Locking will be done to avoid
conflict when there are multiple writers. Rotation can be done by size (after a
certain size is reached), by time (daily/monthly/yearly), or both.
