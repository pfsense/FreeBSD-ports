simple-parsing allows you to transform your ugly argparse scripts into
beautifully structured, strongly typed little works of art. This isn't a fancy,
complicated new command-line tool either, this simply adds new features to
plain-old argparse! Using dataclasses, simple-parsing makes it easier to share
and reuse command-line arguments - no more copy pasting!

Supports inheritance, nesting, easy serialization to json/yaml, automatic help
strings from comments, and much more!
