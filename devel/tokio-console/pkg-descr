tokio-console is an implementation of TurboWish/tokio-console, a diagnostics
and debugging tool for asynchronous Rust programs. the diagnostic toolkit
consists of multiple components:
* a wire protocol for streaming diagnostic data from instrumented applications
  to diagnostic tools
* instrumentation for collecting diagnostic data from a process and exposing it
  over the wire format
* tools for displaying and exploring diagnostic data, implemented as gRPC
  clients using the console wire protocol
