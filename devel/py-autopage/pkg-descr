Autopage is a Python library to automatically display terminal output from a
program in a pager (like less) whenever you need it, and never when you don't.
And it only takes one line of code.

You know how some CLI programs like git (and a handful of others, including man
and systemctl) automatically pipe their output to less? Except not if there's
less than one screen's worth of data. And if you redirect the output to a file
or a pipe, it does the right thing instead. Colours are preserved. Don't you
wish all programs worked like that? Now at least all of your Python programs
can.
