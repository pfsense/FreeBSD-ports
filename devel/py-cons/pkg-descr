The cons package attempts to emulate the semantics of Lisp/Scheme's cons as
closely as possible while incorporating all the built-in Python sequence types.

In computer programming, cons is a fundamental function in most dialects of the
Lisp programming language. cons constructs memory objects which hold two values
or pointers to two values.
