Fabric is a high level Python library designed to execute shell commands
remotely over SSH, yielding useful Python objects in return.

It builds on top of Invoke (subprocess command execution and command-line
features) and Paramiko (SSH protocol implementation), extending their APIs
to complement one another and provide additional functionality.
