Log::Log4perl::Appender::Socket::UNIX is a simple appender for writing to a unix
domain socket. It relies on Socket and only logs to an existing socket - ie.
very useful to always log debug streams to the socket.

The appender tries to stream to a socket. The socket in questions is beeing
created by the client who wants to listen, once created the messages are coming
thru.
