Sus(picious) is an opinionated test framework designed with several goals:
- As fast as possible, aiming for ~10,000 assertions per second per core.
- Isolated tests which parallelise easily (including class definitions).
- Native support for balanced (work-stealing) multi-core execution.
- Incredible test output with detailed failure logging (including nested
  assertions and predicates).

Non-features:
- Flexibility at the expense of performance.
- Backwards compatibility.
