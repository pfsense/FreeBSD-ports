ppft is a friendly fork of Parallel Python (pp). ppft extends Parallel Python to
provide packaging and distribution with pip and setuptools, support for python
3, and enhanced serialization using dill.source. ppft uses Parallel Python to
provide mechanisms for the parallel execution of python code on SMP (systems
with multiple processors or cores) and clusters (computers connected via
network).
