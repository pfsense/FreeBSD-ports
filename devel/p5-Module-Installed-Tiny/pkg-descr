To check if a module is installed (available), generally the simplest way is to
try to require() it. However, this actually loads the module. There are some
cases where this is not desirable: 1) we have to check a lot of modules
(actually loading the modules will take a lot of CPU time and memory; 2) some of
the modules conflict with one another and cannot all be loaded; 3) the module is
OS specific and might not load under another OS; 4) we simply do not want to
execute the module, for security or other reasons.

Module::Installed::Tiny provides a routine module_installed() which works like
Perl's require but does not actually load the module.
