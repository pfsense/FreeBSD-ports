When writing Cython code, special care must be taken to ensure that the code can
be interrupted with CTRL-C. Since Cython optimizes for speed, Cython normally
does not check for interrupts. For example, code like the following cannot be
interrupted in Cython:

while True:
    pass

The cysignals package provides mechanisms to handle interrupts (and other
signals and errors) in Cython code.
