Error handling for libarchive and Archive::Libarchive is fairly primitive. Most
methods return an int which correspond to ARCHIVE_EOF, ARCHIVE_OK,
ARCHIVE_RETRY, ARCHIVE_WARN, ARCHIVE_FAILED or ARCHIVE_FATAL. Some methods will
also return the number of actual bytes written on success and one of these codes
on failure. It can be tedious doing the necessary checks for each method call in
a test, so this module provides tools for testing Archive::Libarchive method
calls that follow this pattern.
