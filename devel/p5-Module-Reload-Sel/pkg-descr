Utility for module developers to selectively reload needed modules
and/or conditionally augment @INC with additional, per-developer
library directories, at development time based on environment
variables.

Particularly helpful in conjunction with mod_perl applications where
some or all application logic resides in separate Perl modules that
would otherwise not get reloaded until the server restarts.
