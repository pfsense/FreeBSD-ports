CGDB is a curses-based interface to the GNU Debugger (GDB). The goal of
CGDB is to be lightweight and responsive; not encumbered with
unnecessary features.

The interface is designed to deliver the familiar GDB text interface,
with a split screen showing the source as it executes. The UI is modeled
on the classic Unix text editor, vi. Those familiar with vi should feel
right at home using CGDB.
