Platypus is a library for creating interfaces to machine code libraries written
in languages like C, C++, Fortran, Rust, Pascal. Essentially anything that gets
compiled into machine code. This implementation uses libffi to accomplish this
task. libffi is battle tested by a number of other scripting and virtual machine
languages, such as Python and Ruby to serve a similar role.
