Courier library which implements several algorithms related to the
Unicode Standard:

 - Look up uppercase, lowercase, and titlecase equivalents of a
   unicode character.

 - Implementation of grapheme and work breaking rules.

 - Implementation of line breaking rules.

 - Several ancillary functions, like looking up the unicode character
   that corresponds to some HTML 4.0 entity (such as "&amp;", for
   example), and determining the normal width or a double-width status
   of a unicode character. Also, an adaptation of the iconv(3) API
   for this unicode library.

This library also implements C++ bindings for these algorithms.
