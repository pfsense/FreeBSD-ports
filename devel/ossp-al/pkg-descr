OSSP al defines an abstract data type of a data buffer that can assemble,
move and truncate chunks of data in a stream but avoids actual copying. It
was built to deal efficiently with communication streams between software
modules. It especially provides flexible semantical data attribution through
by-chunk labeling. It also has convenient chunk traversal methods and
optional OSSP ex based exception handling.
