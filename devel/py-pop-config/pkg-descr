Pop-config is the official tool to allow for creating and app-merging
configuration options for pop projects. Plugin Oriented Programming
presents a means to merge multiple applications together dynamically.
This capabilities requires that the startup of these applications needs
to be managed from within the programming paradigm. Since this is the case
pop-config becomes a critical and hard requirement of pop.

Pop-config is not just about being able to work with pop projects
to facilitate app-merging, it has also been designed to make the startup
of an application much simpler, and to make the expensive boiler plate
of startup and configuration as transparent as possible. When making
pop projects the idea is that projects are developed in very small
chunks and are then dynamically merged together. So the creation of
these mergeable apps needs to be quick and easy!

Pop-config also solves a problem with configuration of applications,
when making a new application, if you want robust configuration
loading, you need to be able to take options from the command line,
environment variables, and configuration files. Pop-config does all
of this for you, and loads them in the correct order, all behind the
scenes, making your life easier.
