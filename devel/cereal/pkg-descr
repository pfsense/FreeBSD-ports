cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library. cereal takes arbitrary
data types and reversibly turns them into different representations, such as
compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON. cereal was designed to be fast,
light-weight, and easy to extend - it has no external dependencies and can be
easily bundled with other code or used standalone.
