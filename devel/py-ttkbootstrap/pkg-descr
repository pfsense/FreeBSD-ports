A supercharged theme extension for Tkinter that enables on-demand modern flat
style themes inspired by Bootstrap.

Features

  * Over a dozen curated dark and light themes.

  * Loads of beautiful pre-defined widget styles such as outline and round
    toggle buttons.

  * Apply colors and types using simple keywords such as primary and striped
    instead of the legacy approach of primary.Striped.Horizontal.TProgressbar.
    If you've used Bootstrap for web development, you are already familiar with
    this approach using css classes.

  * ttkbootstrap comes with several new beautifully designed widgets such as
    Meter, DateEntry, and Floodgauge. Additionally, dialogs are now themed and
    fully customizable.

  * Want to create your own theme? Easy! ttkboostrap includes a built-in theme
    creator that enables you to easily build, load, expore, and apply your own
    custom themes.
