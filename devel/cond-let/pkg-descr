Emacs provides the binding conditionals if-let, if-let*, when-let,
when-let*, and-let* and while-let.

This package implements the missing and-let and while-let*, and the
original cond-let, cond-let*, and$ and and>.

This package additionally provides more consistent and improved
implementations of the binding conditionals already provided by
Emacs. Merely loading this library does not shawow the built-in
implementations; this can optionally be done in the context of an
individual library, as described below.

cond-let and cond-let* are provided exactly under these names. The
names of all other macros implemented by this package begin with
cond-let--, the package's prefix for private symbol.

Users of this package are not expected to use these unwieldy
names. Instead one should use Emacs's shorthand feature to use all or
some of these macros by their conceptual names.
