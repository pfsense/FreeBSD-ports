The gSOAP Web services development toolkit offers an XML to C/C++ language
binding to ease the development of SOAP/XML Web services in C and C/C++.
Most toolkits for C++ Web services adopt a SOAP-centric view and offer APIs
that require the use of class libraries for SOAP-specific data structures.
This often forces a user to adapt the application logic to these libraries.
In contrast, gSOAP provides a transparent SOAP API through the use of proven
compiler technologies. These technologies leverage strong typing to map
XML schemas to C/C++ definitions. Strong typing provides a greater assurance
on content validation of both WSDL schemas and SOAP/XML messages.
