Vc is a free software library to ease explicit vectorization of C++ code. It has
an intuitive API and provides portability between different compilers and
compiler versions as well as portability between different vector instruction
sets. Thus an application written with Vc can be compiled for:
* AVX and AVX2
* SSE2 up to SSE4.2 or SSE4a
* Scalar
* AVX-512 (Vc 2 development)
* NEON (in development)
* NVIDIA GPUs / CUDA (research)
