argc allows to easily parse command line arguments in bash.

To write a command-line program with argc, we only need to do two things:
1. Describe options, flags, positional parameters and subcommands in comments.
2. Insert `eval $(argc "$0" "$@")` into script to let argc to parse command line
   arguments.
