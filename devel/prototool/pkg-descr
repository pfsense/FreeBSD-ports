Protobuf is one of the best interface description languages out there - it's
widely adopted, and after over 15 years of use, it's practically bulletproof.
However, working with Protobuf and maintaining consistency across your Protobuf
files can be a pain - protoc, while being a tool that has stood the test of
time, is non-trivial to use, and the Protobuf community has not developed common
standards with regards to stub generation. Prototool aims to solve this by
making working with Protobuf much simpler.
