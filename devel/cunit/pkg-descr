CUnit is a lightweight system for writing, administering, and running unit tests
in C. It provides C programmers a basic testing functionality with a flexible
variety of user interfaces.

CUnit is built as a static library which is linked with the user's testing code.
It uses a simple framework for building test structures, and provides a rich set
of assertions for testing common data types. In addition, several different
interfaces are provided for running tests and reporting results. These
interfaces currently include: Automated, Basic, Console and Curses.
