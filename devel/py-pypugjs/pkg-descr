PyPugJS is a fork of PyJade with the name Jade changed to PugJS.

Additional disclaimer: Since the original pypugjs died i took the liberty to
keep it alive, because since starting to work with the jade compiler for node I
hate writing HTML and want to continue using it in my Django projects. I will
keep the existing non Django stuff inside the project, but I cannot support
anything other since I'm not actively using it not will be in the foreseable
future. Tornado, Mako etc. support will be welcome tho!

PyPugJS is a high performance port of PugJS for python, that converts any .pug
source into different Template-languages (Django, Jinja2, Mako or Tornado).
