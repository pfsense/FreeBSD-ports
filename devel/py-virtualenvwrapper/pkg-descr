virtualenvwrapper is a set of extensions to Ian Bicking's `virtualenv
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ tool.  The extensions include
wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise
managing your development workflow, making it easier to work on more
than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their
dependencies.
