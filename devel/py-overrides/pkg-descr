A decorator @override that verifies that a method that should override an
inherited method actually does it.

Copies the docstring of the inherited method to the overridden method.

Since signature validation and docstring inheritance are performed on class
creation and not on class instantiation, this library significantly improves the
safety and experience of creating class hierarchies in Python without
significantly impacting performance. See https://stackoverflow.com/q/1167617 for
the initial inspiration for this library.
