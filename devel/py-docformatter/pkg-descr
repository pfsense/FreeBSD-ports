docformatter automatically formats docstrings to follow a subset of the PEP 257
conventions. Below are the relevant items quoted from PEP 257.
- For consistency, always use triple double quotes around docstrings.
- Triple quotes are used even though the string fits on one line.
- Multi-line docstrings consist of a summary line just like a one-line
  docstring, followed by a blank line, followed by a more elaborate description.
- Unless the entire docstring fits on a line, place the closing quotes on a line
  by themselves.

docformatter also handles some of the PEP 8 conventions.
- Don't write string literals that rely on significant trailing whitespace. Such
  trailing whitespace is visually indistinguishable and some editors (or more
  recently, reindent.py) will trim them.

docformatter formats docstrings compatible with black when passed the --black
option.

docformatter formats field lists that use Epytext or Sphinx styles.
