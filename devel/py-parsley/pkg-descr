Parsley is a parsing library for people who find parsers scary or annoying. I
wrote it because I wanted to parse a programming language, and tools like PLY or
ANTLR or Bison were very hard to understand and integrate into my Python code.
Most parser generators are based on LL or LR parsing algorithms that compile to
big state machine tables. It was like I had to wake up a different section of my
brain to understand or work on grammar rules.

Parsley, like pyparsing and ZestyParser, uses the PEG algorithm, so each
expression in the grammar rules works like a Python expression. In particular,
alternatives are evaluated in order, unlike table-driven parsers such as yacc,
bison or PLY.

Parsley is an implementation of OMeta, an object-oriented pattern-matching
language developed by Alessandro Warth.
