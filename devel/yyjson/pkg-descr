A high performance JSON library written in ANSI C.
Features:
* Fast: can read or write gigabytes per second JSON data on modern CPUs.
* Portable: complies with ANSI C (C89) for cross-platform compatibility.
* Strict: complies with RFC 8259 JSON standard, ensuring strict number format
  and UTF-8 validation.
* Extendable: offers options to allow comments, trailing commas, NaN/Inf, and
  custom memory allocator.
* Accuracy: can accurately read and write int64, uint64, and double numbers.
* Flexible: supports unlimited JSON nesting levels, \u0000 characters, and non
  null-terminated strings.
* Manipulation: supports querying and modifying using JSON Pointer, JSON Patch
  and JSON Merge Patch.
* Developer-Friendly: easy integration with only one h and one c file.

Limitations:
* An array or object is stored as a data structure such as linked list, which
  makes accessing elements by index or key slower than using an iterator.
* Duplicate keys are allowed in an object, and the order of the keys is
  preserved.
* JSON parsing result is immutable, requiring a mutable copy for modification.
