This module in an fully object-oriented implementation of a simple n-
ary tree. It is built upon the concept of parent-child relationships,
so therefore every Tree::Simple object has both a parent and a set of
children (who themselves may have children, and so on). Every
Tree::Simple object also has siblings, as they are just the children of
their immediate parent.
