With apipkg you can control the exported namespace of a python package
and greatly reduce the number of imports for your users. It is a small
pure python module that works on virtually all Python versions, including
CPython2.3 to Python3.1, Jython and PyPy. It co-operates well with
Python's help() system, custom importers (PEP302) and common command
line completion tools.
