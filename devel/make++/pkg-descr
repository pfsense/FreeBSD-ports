Makepp is a drop-in replacement for GNU make which has a number of
features that allow for more reliable builds and simpler build files.
It supports almost all of the syntax that GNU make supports, and can
be used with makefiles produced by utilities such as automake. It is
called makepp (or make++) because
    (1) it was designed for building C++ programs;
    (2) its relationship to make is analogous to C++'s relationship
        to C.

For backward compatibility, it will work with input files designed
for make, but there are much better ways to do things.
