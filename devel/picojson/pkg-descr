PicoJSON is a tiny JSON parser / serializer for C++ with the following
properties:

* Header-file only
* No external dependencies (only uses standard C++ libraries)
* STL-friendly (arrays are represented using std::vector, objects are std::map)
* Provides both pull interface and streaming (event-based) interface
