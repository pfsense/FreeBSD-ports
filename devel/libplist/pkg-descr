libimobiledevice is a cross-platform software library that talks the
protocols to support iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad and Apple TV devices.
Unlike other projects, it does not depend on using any existing
proprietary libraries and does not require jailbreaking. It allows
other software to easily access the device's filesystem, retrieve
information about the device and its internals, backup/restore the
device, manage SpringBoard icons, manage installed applications,
retrieve addressbook/calendars/notes and bookmarks and synchronize
music and video to the device.

This port installs the library required to handle Apple Binary and XML
Property Lists.
