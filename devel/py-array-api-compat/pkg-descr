This is a small wrapper around common array libraries that is compatible with
the Array API standard. Currently, NumPy, CuPy, and PyTorch are supported.

Note that some of the functionality in this library is backwards incompatible
with the corresponding wrapped libraries. The end-goal is to eventually make
each array library itself fully compatible with the array API, but this requires
making backwards incompatible changes in many cases, so this will take some
time.

Currently all libraries here are implemented against the 2022.12 version of the
standard.
