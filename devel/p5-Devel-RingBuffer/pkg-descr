Provides shared memory structures (using memory mapped files via
IPC::Mmap) to be used by diagnostic and debugger applications for Perl
scripts (see Devel::STrace).  Using XS/C code to maximize performance,
creates a set of ring buffers with a configurable number of slots.  Each
slot includes a field for a line number, a timestamp, and a fully
qualified subroutine name.  Each ring buffer also includes additional
headers and fields to support diagnostic interfaces, e.g., watched
expressions, command/response interfaces to the monitored applications,
etc.
