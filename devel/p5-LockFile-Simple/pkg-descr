The LockFile::Simple extension provides simple file locking, of
the advisory kind, i.e. it requires cooperation between applications
wishing to lock the same files.

It is meant to be used in quick-and-dirty scripts or more elaborated
programs that want a simple locking scheme, yet with a reasonable
level of configuration.
