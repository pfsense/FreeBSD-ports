Fatal (Facebook Template Library) is a library for fast prototyping software in
modern C++.

It provides facilities heavily based on template meta-programming, while keeping
most of the complexity under-the-hood, to enhance the expressive power of C++.

Fatal also provides lessons on how to write meta-programs, as well as on how to
make the best use of the library, starting at beginner levels.

The goal is make its benefits available to a wider audience other than just
hard-core library writers.
