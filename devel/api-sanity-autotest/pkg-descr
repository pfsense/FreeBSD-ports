API Sanity Autotest is a test generator for shared C/C++ libraries. It can
quickly generate simple ("sanity" or "shallow"-quality) tests for functions from
the library API, using the signatures and data type definitions from the library
header files. The tests can detect critical errors in simple use cases, and can
be improved with highly reusable specialized types. API Sanity Autotest can
execute generated tests and detect all kinds of emitted signals, early program
exits, program hanging and specified requirement failures. API Sanity Autotest
also supports tests in the Template2Code format, and has a random test
generation mode and other useful features.
