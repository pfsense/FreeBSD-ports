Algorithm::Numerical::Shuffle
=============================

Shuffle is a perl module which performs a one pass, fair shuffle on a
list. If the list is passed as a reference to an array, the shuffle
is done in situ.

The running time of the algorithm is linear in the size of the list.
For an in situ shuffle, the memory overhead is constant; otherwise,
linear extra memory is used.

The algorithm used is discussed by Knuth [3]. It was first published
by Fisher and Yates [2], and later by Durstenfeld [1].
