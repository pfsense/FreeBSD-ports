fstrm is an optimized C implementation of Frame Streams that
includes a fast, lockless circular queue implementation
and exposes library interfaces for setting up a dedicated
Frame Streams I/O thread and asynchronously submitting data
frames for transport from worker threads. It was originally
written to facilitate the addition of high speed binary
logging to DNS servers written in C using the dnstap
log format.
