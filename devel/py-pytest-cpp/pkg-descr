pytest-cpp uses pytest runner to discover and execute C++ tests. It supports
Google Test, Boost.Test, and Catch2.

This brings several benefits:
- Allows you to run all your tests in multi-language projects with a single
  command;
- Execute C++ tests in parallel using pytest-xdist plugin;
- Use --junitxml option to produce a single and uniform xml file with all your
  test suite results;
- Filter which tests to run using standard test filtering capabilities, such as
  by file names, directories, keywords by using the -k option, etc.;
