This module processes iCalendar (vCalendar 2.0) files as specified in
RFC 2445 into a data structure. It handles recurrences ("RRULE"s),
exclusions ("EXDATE"s), event updates (events with a "RECURRENCE-ID"),
and nested data structures ("ATTENDEES" and "VALARM"s). It currently
ignores the "VTIMEZONE", "VJOURNAL" and "VFREEBUSY" entry types.
