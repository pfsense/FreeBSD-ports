The PPR module provides a single regular expression that defines a set of
independent subpatterns suitable for matching entire Perl documents, as well as
a wide range of individual syntactic components of Perl (i.e. statements,
expressions, control blocks, variables, etc.)

The regex does not "parse" Perl (that is, it does not build a syntax tree, like
the PPI module does). Instead it simply "recognizes" standard Perl constructs,
or new syntaxes composed from Perl constructs.

Its features and capabilities therefore complement those of the PPI module,
rather than replacing them. See "Comparison with PPI".
