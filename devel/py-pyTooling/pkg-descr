pyTooling is a powerful collection of arbitrary useful abstract data models,
classes, decorators, meta-classes and exceptions. It also provides lots of
helper functions e.g. to ease the handling of package descriptions.

It's useful for any Python-base project independent if it's a library,
framework or CLI tool.
