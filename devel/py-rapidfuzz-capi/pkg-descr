This package provides the C-API of RapidFuzz. It can be used inside
the pyproject.toml to compile and extension module extending
RapidFuzz. Providing this C-API in a separate package simplifies the
build process. It allows the usage on platforms which are not
supported by RapidFuzz, or for which RapidFuzz does not provide wheels
(e.g. because they are not officially supported by numpy).
