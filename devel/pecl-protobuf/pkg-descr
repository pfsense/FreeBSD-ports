Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible
mechanism for serializing structured data -- think XML, but smaller, faster, and
simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data
to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
