%%PKGNAME%% has been installed into:

    %%PREFIX%%/www/rth

Please edit api/properties_inc.php to suit your needs.

If you use MySQL as your database go to the directory
%%PREFIX%%/www/rth/sql and do the following to create
a demo database:

  mysql -u [username] -p [db_name] < rth.sql

If you are upgrading from a prior version of rth note
update instructions at %%PREFIX%%/www/rth/sql.

To make rth available through your web site, I suggest
that you add something like the following to httpd.conf:

    Alias /rth/ "%%PREFIX%%/www/rth"

    <Directory "%%PREFIX%%/www/rth/">
        Options none
        AllowOverride Limit

        Order Deny,Allow
        Deny from all
        Allow from 127.0.0.1 .example.com

        <IfModule dir_module>
            DirectoryIndex home_page.php
        </IfModule>
    </Directory>
