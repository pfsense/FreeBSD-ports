Mojo::Base::XS implements fast XS-based accessors using the Mojolicious
interface. The accessors are based on Class::XSAccessor.

It can monkey-patch itself into Mojo::Base, or be used as a standalone
inclusion. The same limitations from Mojo::Base apply here, namely that
it doesn't support BUILD/before/after wrappers or roles. Use p5-Moo if
you want those features.
