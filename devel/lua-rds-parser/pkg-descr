The lua-rds-parser can be used to parse the Resty-DBD-Stream formatted data
generated by drizzle and/or postgres nginx modules into lua data structures.
In the past, we have to use JSON as the intermediate data format which is
quite inefficient in terms of both memory and CPU time.

To maximize speed and minimize memory footprint, this library is implemented
in pure C.
