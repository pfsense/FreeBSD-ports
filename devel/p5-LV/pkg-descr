LV makes lvalue subroutines easy and practical to use. It's inspired by the
lvalue module which is sadly problematic because of the existence of another
module on CPAN called Lvalue. (They can get confused on file-systems that have
case-insensitive file names.)

LV comes with three different implementations, based on Variable::Magic,
Sentinel and tie; it will choose and use the best available one. You can force
LV to pick a particular implementation using:

    $ENV{PERL_LV_IMPLEMENTATION} = 'Magic'; # or 'Sentinel' or 'Tie'

The tie implementation is the slowest, but will work on Perl 5.6 with only core
modules.
