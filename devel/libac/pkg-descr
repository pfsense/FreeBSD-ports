This port is the C++ implementation of the Aho-Corasick (AC) string matching
algorithm.

The upstream began with pure Lua implementation and realize the performance is
not satisfactory. So they switch to C/C++ implementation.

There are two shared objects provided by this package: libac.so and
ahocorasick.so The former is a regular shared object which can be directly used
by C/C++ application, or by Lua via FFI; and the later is a Lua module.
