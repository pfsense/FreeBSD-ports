While ANSI color escape codes are fairly simple, it can be hard to
remember the codes for all of the attributes and the code resulting
from hard-coding them into your script is definitely difficult to
read. This module is designed to fix those problems, as well as
provide a convenient interface to do a few things for you
automatically (like resetting attributes after the text you print out
so that you don't accidentally leave attributes set).

Despite its name, this module can also handle non-color ANSI text
attributes (bold, underline, reverse video, and blink). It uses either
of two interfaces, one of which uses "constants" for each different
attribute and the other of which uses two subs which take strings of
attributes as arguments.
