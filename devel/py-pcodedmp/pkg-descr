pcodedmp.py is a VBA p-code disassembler.

It is not widely known, but macros written in VBA (Visual Basic for
Applications; the macro programming language used in Microsoft Office) exist in
three different executable forms, each of which can be what is actually executed
at run time, depending on the circumstances.

Since most of the time it is the p-code that determines what exactly a macro
would do (even if neither source code, nor execodes are present), it would make
sense to have a tool that can display it. This is what prompted us to create
this VBA p-code disassembler.
