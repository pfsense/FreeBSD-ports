Syntax::Keyword::Try provides a syntax plugin that implements exception-handling
semantics in a form familiar to users of other languages, being built on a block
labeled with the try keyword, followed by at least one of a catch or finally
block.

As well as providing a handy syntax for this useful behaviour, this module also
serves to contain a number of code examples for how to implement parser plugins
and manipulate optrees to provide new syntax and behaviours for perl code.
