Removes unused imports and unused variables from Python code. It makes use of
pyflakes to do this.

By default, autoflake only removes unused imports for modules that are part of
the standard library. (Other modules may have side effects that make them
unsafe to remove automatically.) Removal of unused variables is also disabled
by default.
