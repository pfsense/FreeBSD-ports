Tie::ShareLite provides for a tied hash interface to the IPC::ShareLite module
that is very similar to the one provided by IPC::Shareable. Only hashes can be
tied at this time. The hashes can be of any complexity allowed by the Storable
module, however, there are some caveats covered in the REFERENCES section of
man page.
