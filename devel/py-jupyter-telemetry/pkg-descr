Jupyter Telemetry enables Jupyter Applications (e.g. Jupyter Server, Jupyter
Notebook, JupyterLab, JupyterHub, etc.) to record events - i.e. actions by
application users - and transmit them to remote (or local) destinations as
structured data. It works with Python's standard logging library to handle the
transmission of events allowing users to send events to local files, over the
web, etc.
