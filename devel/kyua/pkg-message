A tests group has been added and the tests user should be a member
of it by default rather than nobody. You should update your password
database to match (change the group from 65534 to 977 after updating).

To do it, please run the following command:

pw usermod -n tests -g tests
EOD,
	type : upgrade,
	maximum_version: "0.13_5,3"
}
}
