pygame is a Free and Open Source python programming language library for making
multimedia applications like games built on top of the excellent SDL library.
Like SDL, pygame is highly portable and runs on nearly every platform and
operating system. Millions of people have downloaded pygame itself, which is a
whole lot of bits flying across the interwebs.
