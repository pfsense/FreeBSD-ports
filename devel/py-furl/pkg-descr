furl is a small Python library that makes parsing and
manipulating URLs easy.

Python's standard urllib and urlparse modules provide a number of URL
related functions, but using these functions to perform common URL
operations proves tedious. Furl makes parsing and manipulating URLs
easy.

Furl is well tested, Unlicensed in the public domain, and supports
Python 2, Python 3, PyPy2, and PyPy3.
