A D-Bus daemon/broker, that aims to be a drop-in replacement for the
reference implementation of D-Bus, dbus-daemon and dbus-broker. Being
written in pure Rust, it's much easier to build for multiple platforms
(Linux, Mac and Windows being the primary targets) than other D-Bus
brokers.

## Status
Alpha. It's not ready for production use yet. Only the essentials are
in place.
