The Subversive project is a brand new Eclipse plug-in that provides
Subversion support.  From a user point of view, Subversive provides
Subversion support similar to CVS support, which is already part of
the standard Eclipse platform.

The main use cases, which are familiar to CVS users, are:
    * Connection to the repository using different connection types
    * Repository browsing
    * Check-out
    * Synchronization
    * Committing
    * Update
    * Resolving conflicts
    * Adding to the list of ignored resources
