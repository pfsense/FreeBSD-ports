RODI is a dependency injection library for Python 3, providing a lightweight
and fast implementation of the dependency injection pattern. It supports
both synchronous and asynchronous dependency resolution.

Key features:
* Fast dependency injection container
* Support for singleton and transient lifetimes
* Automatic dependency resolution
* Support for factory functions
* Decorator-based service registration
* Type hints support for automatic registration
* Compatible with async/await patterns

RODI is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to integrate into existing
Python applications, particularly web frameworks and applications.
