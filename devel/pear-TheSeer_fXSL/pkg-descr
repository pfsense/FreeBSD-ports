The classes contained within this repository extend the standard XSLTProcess to
use exceptions at all occasions of errors instead of PHP warnings, notices or
semi completed transformations. They also add various custom methods and short-
cuts for convinience and to allow a nicer API to implement callbacks to the PHP
stack.
