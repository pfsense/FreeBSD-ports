This is a second go at a module to simplify installing die() and warn()
handlers, and to make such handlers easier to write and control.

For most people, this just means that if use Religion; then you'll get
noticeably better error reporting from warn() and die(). This is especially
useful if you are using eval().

Religion provides four classes, WarnHandler, DieHandler, WarnPreHandler, and
DiePreHandler, that when you construct them return closures that can be
stored in variables that in turn get invoked by $SIG{__DIE__} and
$SIG{__WARN__}.  Note that if Religion is in use, you should not modify
$SIG{__DIE__} or $SIG{__WARN__}, unless you are careful about invoking
chaining to the old handler.

Religion also provides a TraceBack function, which is used by a DieHandler
after you die() to give a better handle on the current scope of your
situation, and provide information about where you were, which might
