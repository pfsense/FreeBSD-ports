PyQuil is a Python library for quantum programming using Quil, the quantum
instruction language developed at Rigetti Computing. PyQuil serves three main
functions:

* Easily generating Quil programs from quantum gates and classical operations
* Compiling and simulating Quil programs using the Quil Compiler (quilc) and the
  Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM)
* Executing Quil programs on real quantum processors (QPUs) using Quantum Cloud
  Services (QCS)
