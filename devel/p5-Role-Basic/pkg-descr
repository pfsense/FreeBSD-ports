Sometimes you want roles. You're not sure about Moose, Mouse, Moo and
what was that damned Squirrel thing anyway? Then there's Class::Trait,
but it has a funky syntax and the maintainer's deprecated it in favor
of Moose::Role and you really don't care that it handles overloading,
instance application or has a workaround for the SUPER:: bug. You
think a meta-object protocol sounds nifty, but you don't understand
it. Maybe you're not sure you want the syntactic sugar for object
declaration. Maybe you've convinced your colleagues that roles are a
good idea but they're leery of dragging in Moose (your author has had
this happen more than once and heard of others making the same
complaint). Sometimes you just want good old-fashioned roles which let
you separate class responsibility from code reuse.
