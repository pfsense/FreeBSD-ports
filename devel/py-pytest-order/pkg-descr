pytest-order is a pytest plugin that allows you to customize the order in which
your tests are run. It uses the marker order that defines when a specific test
shall run, either by using an ordinal number, or by specifying the relationship
to other tests.

pytest-order is a fork of pytest-ordering that provides additional features like
ordering relative to other tests.
