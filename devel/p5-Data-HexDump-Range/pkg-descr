Creates a dump from binary data and user defined range descriptions.
The goal of this module is to create an easy to understand dump of binary data.

This achieved through:
- Highlighted (colors) dump that is easier to understand than
  a monochrome blob of hex data
- Multiple rendering modes with different output formats
- Bitfield rendering
- Skipping uninterresting data
- The possibility to describe complex structures
