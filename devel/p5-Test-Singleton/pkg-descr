This is a simple, basic module for checking whether a class is a Singleton. A
Singleton describes an object class that can have only one instance in any
system. An example of a Singleton might be a print spooler or system registry,
or any kind of central dispatcher.

For a description and discussion of the Singleton class, see "Design Patterns",
