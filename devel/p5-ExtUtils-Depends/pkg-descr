This module tries to make it easy to build Perl extensions that use
functions and typemaps provided by other perl extensions.  This means
that a perl extension is treated like a shared library that provides
also a C and an XS interface besides the perl one.  This works as long
as the base extension is loaded with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag (usually done
with a

	sub dl_load_flags {0x01}

in the main .pm file) if you need to use functions defined in the
module.
