PyYAML-ft provides a full-featured YAML processing framework for Python with
support for free-threading.

PEP 703 introduced free-threaded Python as a separate build of CPython 3.13.
Thread-safety issues that might have otherwise gone unnoticed are now much
easier to trigger because of the absence of protection from the GIL. Also,
because the free-threaded build is ABI-incompatible, extension modules need to
be separate, free-threaded wheels and declare support for it.

The PyYAML maintainers decided to not port PyYAML to the free-threaded build
before the latter, along with Cython support for it, has been tested more
extensively in real-world applications. Our rationale with this fork is to
implement support for the free-threaded build, so that PyYAML can be tested with
it by its users, even before the port is merged upstream.
