Inline::TT provides Inline access to version 2.0 and higher of the Template
Toolkit. This allows you to house your templates inside the source code file,
while retaining the ability to cache compiled templates on the disk (via
Inline's caching mechanism).

The names of the blocks in the template are exported as functions.  Call these
with a reference to a hash of values, which will be used for interpolation in
the templates. This hash reference is the same as the second argument to the
process method of any Template object. The output from template toolkit will be
returned to you as a single string. Note that leading and trailing spaces are
trimmed, further the template toolkit options PRE_CHOMP and POST_CHOMP are set.
Currently, there is no way to change these behaviors.
