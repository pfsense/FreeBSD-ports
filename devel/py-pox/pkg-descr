pox provides a collection of utilities for navigating and manipulating
filesystems. This module is designed to facilitate some of the low level
operating system interactions that are useful when exploring a filesystem on a
remote host, where queries such as "what is the root of the filesystem?", "what
is the user's name?", and "what login shell is preferred?" become essential in
allowing a remote user to function as if they were logged in locally. While pox
is in the same vein of both the os and shutil builtin modules, the majority of
its functionality is unique and compliments these two modules.
