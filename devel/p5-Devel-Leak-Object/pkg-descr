This module provides tracking of objects, for the purpose of detecting
memory leaks due to circular references or inappropriate caching
schemes.

Object tracking can be enabled on a per object basis or globally.  Any
objects thus tracked are remembered until DESTROYed; details of any
objects left are printed out to stderr at END-time.
