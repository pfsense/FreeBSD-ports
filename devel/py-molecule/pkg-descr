Molecule is designed to aid in the development and testing of Ansible
roles. Molecule provides support for testing with multiple instances,
operating systems and distributions, virtualization providers, test
frameworks and testing scenarios. Molecule is opinionated in order to
encourage an approach that results in consistently developed roles
that are well-written, easily understood and maintained.
