Sometimes you want to make sure that your "faster" algorithm really is faster
than the old way. This lets you check. It might also be useful to check that
your super whizzo XS or Inline::C version is actually faster.

This module is based on the standard Benchmark module. If you have lots of
timings to compare and you don't want to keep running the same benchmarks all
the time, you can pass in a result object from Benchmark::timethis() instead of
sub routine reference.
