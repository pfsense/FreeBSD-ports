This module replaces the standard localtime and gmtime functions with
implementations that return objects. It does so in a backwards
compatible manner, so that using localtime/gmtime in the way documented
in perlfunc will still return what you expect.

The module actually implements most of an interface described by Larry
Wall on the perl5-porters mailing list here:
