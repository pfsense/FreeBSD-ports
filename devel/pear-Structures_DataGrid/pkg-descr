This package offers a toolkit to render out a datagrid in HTML format as
well as many other formats such as an XML Document, an Excel Spreadsheet, an
XUL Document and more. It also offers paging and sorting functionality to
limit the data that is presented and processed. This concept is based on the
.NET Framework DataGrid control and works very well with database and XML
result sets.
