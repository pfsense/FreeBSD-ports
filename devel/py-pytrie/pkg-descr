A trie is an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a mapping
where the keys are sequences, usually strings over an alphabet. In
addition to implementing the mapping interface, tries allow finding the
items for a given prefix, and vice versa, finding the items whose keys
are prefixes of a given key.
