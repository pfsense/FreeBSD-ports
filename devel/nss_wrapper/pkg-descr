There are projects that need to be able to create, modify, and delete Unix
users. Others just switch user IDs to interact with the system on behalf of
another user (e.g. a user space file server). To be able to test applications
like these, you need to grant privileges to modify the passwd and group files.
With nss_wrapper it is possible to define your own passwd and group files to be
used the software while it is under test. The nss_wrapper also allows you to
create a hosts file to set up name resolution for the addresses you use with
socket_wrapper.

Features:
- Provides information for user and group accounts.
- Network name resolution using a hosts file.
- Loading and testing of NSS modules.
