Abseil is an open source collection of C++ libraries drawn from the
most fundamental pieces of Google's internal codebase.  These libraries
are the nuts-and-bolts that underpin almost everything Google runs.
Bits and pieces of these APIs are embedded in most of our open source
projects, and Abseil aims to bring them together into one comprehensive
project.  Abseil encompasses the most basic building blocks of Google's
codebase: code that is production-tested and will be fully maintained
for years to come.
