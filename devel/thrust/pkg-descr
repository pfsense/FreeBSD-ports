Thrust is a parallel algorithms library which resembles the C++ Standard
Template Library (STL). Thrust's high-level interface greatly enhances
programmer productivity while enabling performance portability between GPUs and
multicore CPUs. Interoperability with established technologies (such as CUDA,
TBB, and OpenMP) facilitates integration with existing software.
