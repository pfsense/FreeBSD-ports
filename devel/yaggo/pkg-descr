Yaggo is a tool to generate command line parsers for C++. Yaggo stands
for "Yet Another GenGetOpt" and is inspired by GNU Gengetopt.  It reads
a configuration file describing the switches and argument for a C++
program and it generates one header file that parses the command line
using getopt_long(3). See the Example section below for more details.
