mold is a faster drop-in replacement for existing Unix linkers. It
is several times faster than LLVM lld linker, the second-fastest
open-source linker which I originally created a few years ago.
mold is created for increasing developer productivity by reducing
build time especially in rapid debug-edit-rebuild cycles.
