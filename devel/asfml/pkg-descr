ASFML is an Ada binding of, various viscosity, to the Simple and Fast
Multimedia Library (SFML). It uses Ada types, and portable defined types which
eliminates the inclusion of Ada interface libraries, however most functions are
directly imported.

ASFML is written in standard Ada without the use of any specific GNAT
extensions, however, some indirect dependency could exist through the
representation of some types.
