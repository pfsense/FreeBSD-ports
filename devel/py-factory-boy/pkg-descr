As a fixtures replacement tool, it aims to replace static, hard to maintain
fixtures with easy-to-use factories for complex object. Instead of building an
exhaustive test setup with every possible combination of corner cases,
factory_boy allows you to use objects customized for the current test, while
only declaring the test-specific fields
