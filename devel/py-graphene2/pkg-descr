Graphene is a Python library for building GraphQL schemas/types fast and easily.
- Easy to use: Graphene helps you use GraphQL in Python without effort.
- Relay: Graphene has builtin support for Relay.
- Data agnostic: Graphene supports any kind of data source: SQL (Django,
SQLAlchemy), NoSQL, custom Python objects, etc. We believe that by providing a
complete API you could plug Graphene anywhere your data lives and make your data
available through GraphQL.
