dra ia a command line tool to download release assets from GitHub.

You can do everything `dra` does with the official GitHub cli.

dra helps you download release assets more easily:
- no authentication for public repository (you cannot use gh without
  authentication)
- Built-in generation of pattern to select an asset to download
  (with gh you need to provide glob pattern that you need to
  create manually).
