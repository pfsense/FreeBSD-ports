The sysctlmibinfo library provides an API to explore the sysctl
MIB-Tree and to get the properties of an object, therefore it is
useful to handle an object correctly and to build a sysctl-like
utility.

It implements wrappers around an undocumented kernel interface
to provide a more easy interface, moreover it defines a
'struct sysctlmif_object' and provides a convenient API to build
data structures of sysctlmif_object.
