Jinja2 Extension for Dates and Times

The extension comes with a 'now' tag that provides convenient access to
the arrow.now() API from your templates.  You can control the output
by specifying a format that will be passed to Python's strftime().

TimeExtension extends the environment with a 'datetime_format'
attribute.  It is used as a fallback if you omit the format for 'now'.

jinja2-time implements a convenient interface to modify 'now' by a
relative time offset.
