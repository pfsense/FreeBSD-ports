Devel::PartialDump is a data dumper optimized for logging of arbitrary
parameters.

It attempts to truncate overly verbose data, in a way that is hopefully
more useful for diagnostics warnings than

	warn Dumper(@stuff);

Unlike other data dumping modules there are no attempts at correctness
or cross referencing, this is only meant to provide a slightly deeper
look into the data in question.
