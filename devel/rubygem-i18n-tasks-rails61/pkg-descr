i18n-tasks helps you find and manage missing and unused translations.

This gem analyses code statically for key usages, such as I18n.t('some.key'), in
order to:

* Report keys that are missing or unused.
* Pre-fill missing keys, optionally from Google Translate or DeepL Pro.
* Remove unused keys.

Thus addressing the two main problems of i18n gem design:

* Missing keys only blow up at runtime.
* Keys no longer in use may accumulate and introduce overhead, without you
knowing it.
