ALIRE: Ada LIbrary REpository.

A catalog of ready-to-use Ada libraries plus a command-line tool (alr) to
obtain, build, and use with your own projects.

alr is designed to configure, and deploy custom isolated userspace
environments, known as a project or workspace. Environments will contain
all the state, and dependencies it requires for operation.

Properties and dependencies of projects are managed through a TOML file
(alire.toml, found at the root of Alire workspaces). This file exists locally
for working copies of projects, and the Alire community index stores the files
corresponding to its projects.

You can check the environment alr is using with 'alr printenv'
