flexmock is a testing library for Python that makes it easy to create mocks,
stubs and fakes.

Its API is inspired by a Ruby library of the same name. However, it is not a
goal of Python flexmock to be a clone of the Ruby version. Instead, the focus is
on providing full support for testing Python programs and making the creation of
fake objects as unobtrusive as possible.

As a result, Python flexmock removes a number of redundancies in the Ruby
flexmock API, alters some defaults, and introduces a number of Python-only
features.

flexmock's design focuses on simplicity and intuitivenes. This means that the
API is as lean as possible, though a few convenient short-hand methods are
provided to aid brevity and readability.

flexmock declarations are structured to read more like English sentences than
API calls, and it is possible to chain them together in any order to achieve
high degree of expressiveness in a single line of code.
