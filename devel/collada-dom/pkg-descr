A C++ library that provides an API to the COLLADA Document Object Model

The COLLADA Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming
interface (API) that provides a C++ object representation of a COLLADA
XML instance document.

This project is a library for loading and saving COLLADA documents
that can contain 2D, 3D, physics and other types of content. It allows
developers to create applications that can exchange COLLADA documents
with commercial content creation tools such as Maya, Max or Softimage.

This project is a very lightweight version of the Sourceforce Collada
Repository. It maintains only the base collada parser with minimal
dependencies.
