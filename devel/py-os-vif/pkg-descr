os-vif is a library for plugging and unplugging virtual interfaces (VIFs) in
OpenStack. It provides:
- Versioned objects that represent various types of virtual interfaces and their
  components
-  Base VIF plugin class that supplies a plug() and unplug() interface
-  Plugins for two networking backends - Open vSwitch and Linux Bridge

os-vif is intended to define a common model for representing VIF types in
OpenStack. With the exception of the two included plugins, all plugins for other
networking backends are maintained in separate code repositories.
