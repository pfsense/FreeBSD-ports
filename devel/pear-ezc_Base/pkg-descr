The Base component provides the basic functionality, such as autoloading,
that all eZ Components need to function properly. The Base component needs
to be loaded specifically. Base can also autoload external class reposito-
ries from outside the eZ Components.

Aside from the autoload functionality, the Base component also contains a
number of generic Exception classes that all inherit from the ezcBaseExce-
ption class.
