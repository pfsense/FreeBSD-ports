Argcomplete provides easy, extensible command line tab completion of arguments
for your Python script.

It makes two assumptions:
- You're using bash as your shell (limited support for zsh and tcsh is
  available)
- You're using argparse to manage your command line arguments/options

Argcomplete is particularly useful if your program has lots of options or
subparsers, and if your program can dynamically suggest completions for your
argument/option values (for example, if the user is browsing resources over the
network).
