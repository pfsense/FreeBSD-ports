The opentelemetry-instrumentation-all gem is an all-in-one distribution of
community maintained instrumentation. Instrumentation libraries are packaged as
individual gems for flexibility and maintainability. Instead of having to
require each instrumentation individually, applications can depend on this
all-in-one gem as a convenient alternative.
