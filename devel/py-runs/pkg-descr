The runs Python library provides enhanced versions of the subprocess
module's functions, such as call(), check_call(), check_output(), and
run(). It allows users to execute blocks of text as a sequence of
subprocess calls, handling multiple commands, line continuations, and
comments. The library also offers features like optional logging,
error handling and lazy evaluation.
