Resolve specially formated statements to Python objects.

Turn strings like "packagename.modulename:Eval().the_rest()" into
whatever you would get back by performing a similar sequence of
imports and calls. This is useful for config files and situations
where you would like to import things in a lazy way. Later this
package will probably provide a way to restrict resolution for safety.
