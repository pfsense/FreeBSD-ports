This is a very preliminary release of CamlJava, an OCaml/Java
interface based on the following schema:

         Caml/C interface       JNI (Java Native Interface)
  Caml <------------------> C <-----------------------------> Java

Currently, CamlJava provides a low-level, weakly-typed OCaml interface
very similar to the JNI.  Java object references are mapped to an
abstract type, and various JNI-like operations are provided to allow
Java method invocation, field access, and more.  A basic callback
facility (allowing Java code to invoke methods on Caml objects) is
also provided, although some stub Java code must be written by hand.

In the future, a higher-level, strongly-typed interface will be
provided, whereas Java classes are mapped directly to Caml classes.
This raises fairly delicate type mapping issues, though, so don't hold
your breath.
