This module serves as a common base class for test log parsers. These
tools are intended to be able to parse output from a wide variety of
tests - including non-Perl tests.

The parsers also write the test data into the 'Test Result Publication
Interface' (TRPI) XML schema, developed by SpikeSource. See
