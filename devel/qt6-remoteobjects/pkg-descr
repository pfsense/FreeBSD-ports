Qt Remote Objects (QtRO) is an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) module
developed for Qt. This module extends Qt's existing functionalities to enable
information exchange between processes or computers, easily.

One of Qt's key features, to enable this information exchange, is the
distinction between an object's API (defined by its properties, signals, and
slots) and the implementation of that API. QtRO's purpose is to meet that
expected API, even if the true QObject is in a different process. A slot called
on a copy of an object (the Replica in QtRO) is forwarded to the true object
(the Source in QtRO) for handling. Every Replica receives updates to the
Source, either property changes or emitted signals.
