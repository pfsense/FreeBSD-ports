OpTree provides optimized PyTree utilities.

A PyTree is a recursive structure that can be an arbitrarily nested Python
container (e.g., tuple, list, dict, OrderedDict, NamedTuple, etc.) or an opaque
Python object. The key concepts of tree operations are tree flattening and its
inverse (tree unflattening). Additional tree operations can be performed based
on these two basic functions.
