Whenever you use UNIVERSAL::isa as a function, a kitten using
Test::MockObject dies. Normally, the kittens would be helpless, but if they
use UNIVERSAL::isa (the module whose docs you are reading), the kittens can
live long and prosper.

This module replaces UNIVERSAL::isa with a version that makes sure that if
it's called as a function on objects which override isa, isa will be
called on those objects as a method.

In all other cases the real UNIVERSAL::isa is just called directly.
