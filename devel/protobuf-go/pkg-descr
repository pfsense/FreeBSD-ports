This project hosts the Go implementation for protocol buffers, which is
a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for
serializing structured data. The protocol buffer language is a language
for specifying the schema for structured data. This schema is compiled
into language specific bindings. This project provides both a tool to
generate Go code for the protocol buffer language, and also the runtime
implementation to handle serialization of messages in Go.
