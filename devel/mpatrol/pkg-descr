The mpatrol library is a powerful debugging tool that attempts to diagnose
run-time errors that are caused by the wrong use of dynamically allocated
memory. It acts as a malloc() debugger for debugging dynamic memory
allocations, although it can also trace and profile calls to malloc() and
free() too.
