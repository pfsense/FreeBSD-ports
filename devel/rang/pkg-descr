C++ library for terminal goodies. It allows to print colored and styled text
on the terminals that support it, avoiding the need to explicitly hardcode
terminal sequences which is commonly done by software authors at the expense
of code elegance.

It also avoids printing terminal sequences when the program output is redirected
to the file, a common problem in such situations.
