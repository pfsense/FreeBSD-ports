Roswell is a Lisp implementation installer/manager, launcher, and much more! It
started as a command-line tool with the aim to make installing and managing
Common Lisp implementations really simple and easy.

Roswell has now evolved into a full-stack environment for Common Lisp
development, and has many features that makes it easy to test, share, and
distribute your Lisp applications.
