Zapcc is a caching C++ compiler based on clang, designed to perform faster
compilations. zapcc uses in-memory compilation cache in client-server
architecture, remembering all compilation information between runs.
zapcc is the client while zapccs is the server. Each zapcc run will reuse
an existing server or if none was available will start a new one.
