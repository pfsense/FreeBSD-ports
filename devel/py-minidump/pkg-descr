Python library to parse and read Microsoft minidump file format. Can create
minidumps on Windows machines using the windows API (implemented with ctypes).

This module is primarily intended to be used as a library, however for the sake
of demonstrating its capabilities there is a command line tool implemented
called minidump. This tool has the following modes of operation:

- Console, for one-shot parsing and information retrieval.
- Shell, where a user may use an interactive command shell to get all info
  (modules, threads, exceptions etc) and browse the virtual memory of the
  process dumped (read/read int/read uint/move/peek/tell)
