pytest-qt is a pytest plugin that allows programmers to write tests for PyQt5,
PyQt6, PySide2 and PySide6 applications.

The main usage is to use the qtbot fixture, responsible for handling qApp
creation as needed and provides methods to simulate user interaction, like key
presses and mouse clicks.
