PyCXX is a set of C++ facilities to make it easier to write Python
extensions. The chief way in which PyCXX makes it easier to write Python
extensions is that it greatly increases the probability that your program
will not make a reference-counting error and will not have to continually
check error returns from the Python C API.

PyCXX integrates Python with C++ in these ways:
   - C++ exception handling is relied on to detect errors and clean up. In
     a complicated function this is often a tremendous problem when writing
     in C. With PyCXX, we let the compiler keep track of what objects need
     to be dereferenced when an error occurs.
   - The Standard Template Library (STL) and its many algorithms plug and
     play with Python containers such as lists and tuples.
   - The optional CXX_Extensions facility allows you to replace the clumsy
     C tables with objects and method calls that define your modules and
     extension objects.
