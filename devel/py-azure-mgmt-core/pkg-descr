This is the Microsoft Azure Management Core Library for Python

Azure management core library defines extensions to Azure Core that are
specific to ARM (Azure Resource Management) needed when you use client
libraries.

As an end user, you don't need to manually install azure-mgmt-core because it
will be installed automatically when you install other SDKs.
