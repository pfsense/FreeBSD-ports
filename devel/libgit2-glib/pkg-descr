libgit2-glib is a glib wrapper library around the libgit2 git access library.

libgit2 only implements the core plumbing functions, not really the higher
level porcelain stuff. For a primer on Git Internals that you will need to know
to work with Git at this level, check out [Chapter 9][pg] of the Pro Git book.
