AmazingPrint is a fork of AwesomePrint which became stale and should be used in
its place to avoid conflicts. It is a Ruby library that pretty prints Ruby
objects in full color exposing their internal structure with proper indentation.
Rails ActiveRecord objects and usage within Rails templates are supported via
included mixins.
