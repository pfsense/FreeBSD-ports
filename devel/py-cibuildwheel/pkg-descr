cibuildwheel allows building Python wheels across Mac, Linux, Windows,
on multiple versions of Python.

cibuildwheel runs on your CI server - currently it supports GitHub Actions,
Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, CircleCI, and GitLab CI - and it builds
and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.
