The Way is a code snippets manager for your terminal.

Record and retrieve snippets you use every day, or once in a blue moon, without
having to spin up a browser. Just call the-way new to add a snippet with a
description, a language, and some tags attached.

'the-way search' fuzzy searches your snippets library (with optional filters on
language and tags) and lets you:
* edit a snippet with Shift-Right
* delete a snippet with Shift-Left
* copy a particular snippet to your clipboard (with Enter), so you can paste it
  into whatever editor or IDE you're working with.
