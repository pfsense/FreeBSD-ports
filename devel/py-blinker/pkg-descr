Blinker provides fast & simple object-to-object and broadcast signaling for
Python objects.

The core of Blinker is quite small but provides powerful features:
- a global registry of named signals
- anonymous signals
- custom name registries
- permanently or temporarily connected receivers
- automatically disconnected receivers via weak referencing
- sending arbitrary data payloads
- collecting return values from signal receivers
- thread safety
