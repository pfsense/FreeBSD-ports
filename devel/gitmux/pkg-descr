Gitmux shows git status in your tmux status bar.

Features:
- easy. Install and forget about it
- minimal. Just shows what you need, when you need it
- discrete. Get out of your way if current directory is not in a Git tree
- shell-agnostic. Does not rely on shell-features so works with all of them
