Bugspots - Bug Prediction Heuristic

An implementation of the simple bug prediction heuristic outlined
by the Google Engineering team: Bug Prediction at Google

    Well, we actually have a great, authoritative record of where
    code has been requiring fixes: our bug tracker and our source
    control commit log! The research indicates that predicting bugs
    from the source history works very well, so we decided to deploy
    it at Google.

Point bugspots at any git repo and it will identify the hotspots
for you.
