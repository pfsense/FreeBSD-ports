This module provides a new syntax keyword, defer, in a forward-compatible way.

The latest perl development source provides a defer block syntax, under the
defer named feature. If all goes well, this will become available at
development version 5.35.4, and included in the 5.36 release. On such perls,
this module simply enables that feature.

       defer {
          STATEMENTS...
       }

The defer keyword introduces a block which runs its code body at the time that
its immediately surrounding code block finishes.
