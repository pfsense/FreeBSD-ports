d2to1 (the 'd' is for 'distutils') allows using distutils2-like
setup.cfg files for a package's metadata with a distribute/setuptools
setup.py script.

It works by providing a distutils2-formatted setup.cfg file containing
all of a package's metadata, and a very minimal setup.py which will
slurp its arguments from the setup.cfg.
