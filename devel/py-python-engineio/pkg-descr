This project implements Python based Engine.IO client and server that can run
standalone or integrated with a variety of Python web frameworks and
applications.

Engine.IO is a lightweight transport protocol that enables real-time
bidirectional event-based communication between clients (typically, though not
always, web browsers) and a server. The official implementations of the client
and server components are written in JavaScript. This package provides Python
implementations of both, each with standard and asyncio variants.

The Engine.IO protocol is extremely simple. Once a connection between a client
and a server is established, either side can send "messages" to the other side.
Event handlers provided by the applications on both ends are invoked when a
message is received, or when a connection is established or dropped.
