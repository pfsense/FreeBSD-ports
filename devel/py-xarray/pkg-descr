xarray (formerly xray) is an open source project and Python package that aims to
bring the labeled data power of pandas to the physical sciences, by providing
N-dimensional variants of the core pandas data structures.

Our goal is to provide a pandas-like and pandas-compatible toolkit for analytics
on multi-dimensional arrays, rather than the tabular data for which pandas
excels. Our approach adopts the Common Data Model for self- describing
scientific data in widespread use in the Earth sciences: xarray.Dataset is an
in-memory representation of a netCDF file.
