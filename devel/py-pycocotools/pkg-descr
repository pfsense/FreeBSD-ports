pycocotools is a fork of the original cocoapi, with bug fixes and packaging
improvements.

Changes in this fork include:
- Add CircleCI tests
- Support pip-installation correctly
- Support windows
- Don't import matplotlib unless needed
- Close file handle after openning
- Fix a small bug in rleToBbox
- Fix a segfault in RLE decoding
- Fix deprecated usage of other libraries

For compatibility, we will not make any API changes or non-bug behavior changes
to the existing APIs of the official cocoapi.
