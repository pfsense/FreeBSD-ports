POEx::Role::SessionInstantiation provides a nearly seamless
integration for non-POE objects into a POE environment. It does this
by handling the POE stuff behind the scenes including allowing per
instances method changes, session registration to the Kernel, and
providing some defaults like setting an alias if supplied via the
attribute or constructor argument, or defining a _default that warns
if your object receives an event that it does not have.

This role exposes your class' methods as POE events.
