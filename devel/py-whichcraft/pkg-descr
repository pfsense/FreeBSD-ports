This package provides cross-platform cross-python shutil.which
functionality.

This is a shim of the shutil.which function that's designed to work
across multiple versions of Python and inside of windows. The code for
Python 2.x is based on Python 3 code that I extracted from source. I
originally did this for Cookiecutter but pulled it out in order to
reduce line count for that project.
