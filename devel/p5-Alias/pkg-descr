Alias is a perl module that performs aliasing services.  It is useful for
those of you that are tired of dereferencing hash-based object attributes,
or wish perl could make-do with fewer $, -> and {} things, or are a little
scared of using typeglobs, or want the freedom to put what you want, when you
want in the symbol table without having to deal with weird syntax, or need
to use scalar constants in your program since you don't trust yourself from
changing $PI (heh).  Most notably, there is a C<attr> function that installs
a whole hash on the symbol table with implicit localization.  This allows
you to access object attributes without having to deref the object every
time, as in most other OO languages.
