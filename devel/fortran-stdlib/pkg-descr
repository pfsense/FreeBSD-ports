The Fortran Standard Library is a community driven de facto standard library for
Fortran.

The goal of the Fortran Standard Library is to achieve the following general
scope:
- Utilities (containers, strings, files, OS/environment integration, unit
  testing & assertions, logging, ...)
- Algorithms (searching and sorting, merging, ...)
- Mathematics (linear algebra, sparse matrices, special functions, fast Fourier
  transform, random numbers, statistics, ordinary differential equations,
  numerical integration, optimization, ...)
