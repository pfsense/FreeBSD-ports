Some projects, such as a file server, need privilege separation to be able to
switch to the user who owns the files and do file operations on their behalf.
uid_wrapper convincingly lies to the application, letting it believe it is
operating as root and even switching between UIDs and GIDs as needed. You can
start any application making it believe it is running as root.

Features:
- Allows uid switching as a normal user.
- Start any application making it believe it is running as root.
- Support for user/group changing in the local thread using the syscalls (like
  glibc).
- uid_wrapper intercepts seteuid(2) and related calls and simulates them in a
  way transparent to the application
