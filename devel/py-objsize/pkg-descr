Traversal over Python's objects subtree and calculate the total size of the
subtree in bytes (deep size).

This module traverses all child objects using Python's internal GC
implementation. It attempts to ignore shared objects (i.e., None, types,
modules, classes, functions, lambdas), as they are common among all objects.
It is implemented without recursive calls for high performance.
