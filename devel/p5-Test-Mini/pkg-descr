Test::Mini is a light, spry testing framework built to bring the familiarity of
an xUnit testing framework to Perl as a first-class citizen. Based initially on
Ryan Davis' minitest, it provides a not only a simple way to write and run
tests, but the necessary infrastructure for more expressive test fromeworks to
be written.
