Native datetime instances are enough for basic cases but when you face more
complex use-cases they often show limitations and are not so intuitive to work
with. Pendulum provides a cleaner and more easy to use API while still relying
on the standard library. So it's still datetime but better.

Unlike other datetime libraries for Python, Pendulum is a drop-in replacement
for the standard datetime class (it inherits from it), so, basically, you can
replace all your datetime instances by DateTime instances in your code
(exceptions exist for libraries that check the type of the objects by using the
type function like sqlite3 or PyMySQL for instance).

It also removes the notion of naive datetimes: each Pendulum instance is
timezone-aware and by default in UTC for ease of use.

Pendulum also improves the standard timedelta class by providing more intuitive
methods and properties.
