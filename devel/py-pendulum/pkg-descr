Pendulum is a Python package to ease datetimes manipulation.

It provides classes that are drop-in replacements for the native ones (they
inherit from them).

Special care has been taken to ensure timezones are handled correctly, and
are based on the underlying tzinfo implementation. For example all
comparisons are done in UTC or in the timezone of the datetime being used.
