TLSH is a fuzzy matching program and library.  Given a file (min 50 bytes),
TLSH generates a hash value which can be used for similarity comparisons.
Similar files will have similar hash values which allows for the detection of
similar objects by comparing their hash values.

This port only includes the core C++ library.
