Minilla is a CPAN module authoring tool. Minilla provides 'minil' command for
authorizing a CPAN distribution. The repository created and managed by Minilla
is git install ready, and cpan of course. Minilla is built on only few small
libraries. You can install Minilla without a huge list of dependencies to
heavy modules. Conventions: module written in Pure Perl are located in lib/;
executable file is in script/ directory, if any; module is maintained with
Git and git ls-files matches with what you will release; module has a static
list of prerequisites that can be described in cpanfile; has a Changes file.
