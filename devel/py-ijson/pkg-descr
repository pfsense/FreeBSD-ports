Ijson is an iterative JSON parser with a standard Python iterator interface.

Ijson provides several implementations of the actual parsing in the form of
backends located in ijson/backends:
- yajl2_cffi: wrapper around YAJL 2.x using CFFI, this is the fastest.
- yajl2: wrapper around YAJL 2.x using ctypes, for when you can't use CFFI for
  some reason.
- yajl: deprecated YAJL 1.x + ctypes wrapper, for even older systems.
- python: pure Python parser, good to use with PyPy
