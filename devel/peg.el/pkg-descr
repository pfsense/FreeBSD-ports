This package implements Parsing Expression Grammars for Emacs Lisp.

Parsing Expression Grammars (PEG) are a formalism in the spirit of
Context Free Grammars (CFG) with some simplifications which makes the
implementation of PEGs as recursive descent parsers particularly
simple and easy to understand [Ford, Baker].

PEGs are more expressive than regexps and potentially easier to use.
