This module creates and manipulates PAR distributions.  They are
architecture-specific PAR files, containing everything under blib/
of CPAN distributions after their "make" or "Build" stage, a META.yml
describing metadata of the original CPAN distribution, and a MANIFEST
detailing all files within it.  Digitally signed PAR distributions
will also contain a SIGNATURE file.

The naming convention for such distributions is:

    $NAME-$VERSION-$ARCH-$PERL_VERSION.par

For example, "PAR-Dist-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par" corresponds to the
0.01 release of "PAR-Dist" on CPAN, built for perl 5.8.0 running on
"i386-freebsd".
