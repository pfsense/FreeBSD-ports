This little package serves to access the symbol table of perl.

Devel::Symdump->rnew(@packages)

returns a symbol table object for all subtrees below @packages.
Nested Modules are analyzed recursively. If no package is given as
argument, it defaults to main. That means to get the whole symbol
table, just do a rnew without arguments.

Devel::Symdump->new(@packages)

does not go into recursion and only analyzes the packages that are
given as arguments.
