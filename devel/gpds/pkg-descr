GPDS is a General Purpose Data Serializer library written in modern C++.
It allows to serialize C++ classes to and from XML files in a generic format
that can be processed by other XML processing software (or just for the sake of
readability).

GPDS provides the user with complete control over the generated tag names and
attributes in the resulting XML compared to just using traditional "key" and
"value" tags.
