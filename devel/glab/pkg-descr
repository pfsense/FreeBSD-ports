GLab is an open source GitLab CLI tool bringing GitLab
to your terminal next to where you are already working
with git and your code without switching between windows
and browser tabs.

Work with issues, merge requests, watch running pipelines
directly from your CLI among other features. Inspired by gh,
the official GitHub CLI tool.

GLab is available for repositories hosted on GitLab.com and
self-hosted GitLab Instances. glab supports multiple
authenticated GitLab instances and automatically detects the
authenticated hostname from the remotes available in
the working git directory.
