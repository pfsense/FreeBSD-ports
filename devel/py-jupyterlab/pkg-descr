JupyterLab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible
computing, based on the Jupyter Notebook and Architecture.

JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter offering
all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook,
terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and
powerful user interface. JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter
Notebook.

The current JupyterLab releases are suitable for general usage, and the
extension APIs will continue to evolve for JupyterLab extension developers.
