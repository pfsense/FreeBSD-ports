SnakyHash gem is used by the oauth and oauth2 gems, and others, to normalize
hash keys and lookups, and provide a nice psuedo-object interface.

It has its roots in the Rash (specifically the rash_alt flavor), which is a
special Mash, made popular by the hashie gem.

Classes that include SnakyHash::Snake should inherit from Hashie::Mash.
