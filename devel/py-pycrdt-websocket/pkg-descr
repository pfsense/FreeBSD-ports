Pycrdt-websocket is a Python library for building WebSocket servers and clients
that connect and synchronize shared documents. It can be used to create
collaborative web applications.

The following diagram illustrates a typical architecture. The goal is to share a
document among several clients.

Each client has an instance of a Doc, representing their view of a document. A
shared document also lives in a room on the server side. Conceptually, a room
can be seen as the place where clients collaborate on a document. The WebSocket
to which a client connects points to the corresponding room through the endpoint
path. In the example below, clients A and B connect to a WebSocket at path
room-1, and thus both clients find themselves in a room called room-1. All the
Doc synchronization logic is taken care of by the WebsocketProvider.

Each update to a shared document can be persisted to disk using a store, which
can be a file or a database.
