A library for handling page faults in user mode. A page fault occurs
when a program tries to access to a region of memory that is currently
not available. Catching and handling a page fault is a useful
technique for implementing:
 * pageable virtual memory,
 * memory-mapped access to persistent databases,
 * generational garbage collectors,
 * stack overflow handlers,
 * distributed shared memory,
