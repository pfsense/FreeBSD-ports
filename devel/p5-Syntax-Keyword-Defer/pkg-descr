This module provides a syntax plugin that implements a block which executes
when the containing scope has finished.

       use Syntax::Keyword::Defer;

       {
          my $dbh = DBI->connect( ... ) or die "Cannot connect";
          defer { $dbh->disconnect; }

          my $sth = $dbh->prepare( ... ) or die "Cannot prepare";
          defer { $sth->finish; }

          ...
       }
