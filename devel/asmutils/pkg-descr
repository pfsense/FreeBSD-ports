asmutils is a set of miscellaneous utilities written in assembly language,
targeted for x86 embedded systems and small distributions (like rescue or
installation disks); it also contains small libc and crypto libraries.  It
features the smallest possible size and memory requirements, the fastest
speed (with few exceptions), and good functionality.
