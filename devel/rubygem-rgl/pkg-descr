RGL is a framework for graph data structures and algorithms.

The design of the library is much influenced by the Boost Graph
Library (BGL) which is written in C++ heavily using its template
mechanism. Refer to http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc for further
links and documentation on graph data structures and algorithms and
the design rationales of BGL.
