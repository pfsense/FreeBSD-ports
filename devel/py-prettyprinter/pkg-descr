PrettyPrinter is a Syntax-highlighting, declarative and composable pretty
printer.

Key Features:

* Drop in replacement for the standard library pprint: just rename pprint to
  prettyprinter in your imports.
* Uses a modified Wadler-Leijen layout algorithm for optimal formatting.
* Write pretty printers for your own types with a dead simple, declarative
  interface.
