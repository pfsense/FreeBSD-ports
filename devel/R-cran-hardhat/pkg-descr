Building modeling packages is hard. A large amount of effort generally
goes into providing an implementation for a new method that is
efficient, fast, and correct, but often less emphasis is put on the
user interface. A good interface requires specialized knowledge
about S3 methods and formulas, which the average package developer
might not have. The goal of 'hardhat' is to reduce the burden around
building new modeling packages by providing functionality for
preprocessing, predicting, and validating input.
