This is a self-contained library for reading and writing Windows Registry "hive"
binary files.

Unlike many other tools in this area, it doesn't use the textual .REG format for
output, because parsing that is as much trouble as parsing the original binary
format. Instead it makes the file available through a C API, or there is a
separate program to export the hive as XML.
