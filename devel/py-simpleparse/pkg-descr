SimpleParse is a BSD-licensed Python package providing a simple and fast parser
generator using a modified version of the mxTextTools text-tagging engine.
SimpleParse allows you to generate parsers directly from your EBNF grammar.

Unlike most parser generators, SimpleParse generates single-pass parsers (there
is no distinct tokenization stage), an approach taken from the predecessor
project (mcf.pars) which attempted to create "autonomously parsing regex
objects". The resulting parsers are not as generalized as those created by, for
instance, the Earley algorithm, but they do tend to be useful for the parsing
of computer file formats and the like (as distinct from natural language and
similar "hard" parsing problems).

As of version 2.1.0 the SimpleParse project includes a patched copy of the
mxTextTools tagging library with the non-recursive rewrite of the core parsing
loop.  This means that you will need to build the extension module to use
SimpleParse, but the effect is to provide a uniform parsing platform where all
of the features of a give SimpleParse version are always available.
