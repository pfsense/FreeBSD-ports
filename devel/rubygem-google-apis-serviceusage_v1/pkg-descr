This is the simple REST client for Service Usage API V1. Simple REST clients are
Ruby client libraries that provide access to Google services via their HTTP REST
API endpoints. These libraries are generated and updated automatically based on
the discovery documents published by the service, and they handle most concerns
such as authentication, pagination, retry, timeouts, and logging. You can use
this client to access the Service Usage API, but note that some services may
provide a separate modern client that is easier to use.
