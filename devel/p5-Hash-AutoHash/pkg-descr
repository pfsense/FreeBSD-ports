This is yet another module that lets you access or change the elements
of a hash using methods with the same name as the element's key.  It
follows in the footsteps of Hash::AsObject, Hash::Inflator,
Data::OpenStruct::Deep, Object::AutoAccessor, and probably others. The
main difference between this module and its forebears is that it
supports tied hashes, in addition to regular hashes. This allows a
modular division of labor: this class is generic and treats all hashes
the same; any special semantics come from the tied hash.
