YouCompleteMe is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion
engine for Vim. It has several completion engines:

* an identifier-based engine that works with every programming language,
* a Clang-based engine that provides native semantic code completion for
C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++ (from now on referred to as "the C-family
languages")
* a Jedi-based completion engine for Python 2 and 3 (using the JediHTTP wrapper)
* an OmniSharp-based completion engine for C#
* a combination of Gocode and Godef semantic engines for Go
* a TSServer-based completion engine for TypeScript
* a Tern-based completion engine for JavaScript
* a racer-based completion engine for Rust
* an omnifunc-based completer that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system
to provide semantic completions for many other languages (Ruby, PHP etc.)
