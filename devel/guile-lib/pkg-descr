guile-lib is intended as an accumulation place for pure-scheme Guile modules,
allowing for people to cooperate integrating their generic Guile modules into a
coherent library.

guile-lib modules are well-documented and well-supported. Particularly good
modules might migrate from Guile-Lib into Guile itself, at some point.

Think "a down-scaled, limited-scope CPAN for Guile".
