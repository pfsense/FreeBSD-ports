stdlib is a library of modules for common programming tasks, including list,
table and functional operations, objects, pickling, pretty-printing and
command-line option parsing.

stdlib has no run-time prerequisites beyond a standard Lua system, though it
will take advantage of strict and typecheck if they are installed.
