Class::Hook enables you to trace methods calls from your code to other classes.

Instead of putting 'use Foo;' in your code, simply type 'use Class::Hook;'.
The class Foo is unknown in your code. It will be magically caught by
Class::Hook which will call Foo itself. You can see Class::Hook as a kind of
relay.

You can setup a subroutine to be called before any call to Foo->amethod and a
subroutine to be called after the call. Your subs will receive all the
information that Foo->amethod will receive, so you can trace everything
between your code and Foo.
