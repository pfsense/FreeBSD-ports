The Parse::Template class evaluates Perl expressions placed within
a text. This class can be used as a code generator, or a generator
of documents in various document formats (HTML, XML, RTF, etc.).

Parse::Template was initially created to serve as a code generator
for the Parse::Lex class. The class is now available as a separate
module.
