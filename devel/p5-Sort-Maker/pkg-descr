This module has two main goals: to make it easy to create correct sort
functions, and to make it simple to select the optimum sorting algorithm
for the number of items to be sorted. Sort::Maker generates complete
sort subroutines in one of four styles, plain, orcish manouver,
Schwartzian Transform and the Guttman-Rosler Transform. You can also get
the source for a sort sub you create via the sorter_source call.
