Log::Dispatch is a suite of OO modules for logging messages to multiple
outputs, each of which can have a minimum and maximum log level.  It is
designed to be easily subclassed, both for creating a new dispatcher
object and particularly for creating new outputs.

It also allows both global (dispatcher level) and local (logging object)
message formatting callbacks which allows greater flexibility and should
reduce the need for subclassing.

Subclassing is only needed to send a message to a different output, not
to change the message format.
