Proxmoxer is a wrapper around the Proxmox REST API v2.

It was inspired by slumber, but it dedicated only to Proxmox. It
allows to use not only REST API over HTTPS, but the same api over
ssh and pvesh utility.

Like Proxmoxia it dynamically creates attributes which responds to
the attributes you've attempted to reach.
