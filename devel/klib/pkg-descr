Klib is a standalone and lightweight C library distributed under MIT/X11
license. Most components are independent of external libraries, except the
standard C library, and independent of each other. To use a component of
this library, you only need to copy a couple of files to your source code
tree without worrying about library dependencies.

Klib strives for efficiency and a small memory footprint. Some components,
such as hash table, B-tree, vector and sorting algorithms, are among the most
efficient implementations of similar algorithms or data structures in all
programming languages, in terms of both speed and memory use.
