Log::Dump is a simple logger mix-in mainly for debugging. This
installs six methods into a caller (the class that used Log::Dump) via
Sub::Install. The point is you don't need to load extra dumper modules
or you don't need to concatenate messages. Just log things and they
will be dumped (and concatenated if necessary) to stderr, and to a
file if you prefer. Also, you can use these logging methods as class
methods or object methods (though usually you don't want to mix them,
especially when you're doing something special).
