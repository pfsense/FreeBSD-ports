Find recursive dependencies of 'R' packages from various sources. Solve the
dependencies to obtain a consistent set of packages to install. Download
packages, and install them. It supports packages on 'CRAN', 'Bioconductor' and
other 'CRAN-like' repositories, 'GitHub', package 'URLs', and local package
trees and files. It caches metadata and package files via the 'pkgcache'
package, and performs all 'HTTP' requests, downloads, builds and installations
in parallel. 'pkgdepends' is the workhorse of the 'pak' package.
