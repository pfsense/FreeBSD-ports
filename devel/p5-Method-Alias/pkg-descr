Method::Alias is designed to be used as a pragma, to which you provide a
set of pairs of method names. Only very minimal checking is done, if you
wish to create infinite loops or what have you, you are more than
welcome to shoot yourself in the foot.

# Add a single method alias
    use Method::Alias 'foo' => 'bar';

# Add several method aliases
    use Method::Alias 'a' => 'b',
    'c' => 'd',
    'e' => 'f';
