Future::IO provides a few basic methods that behave similarly to the same-named
core perl functions relating to IO operations, but yield their results
asynchronously via Future instances.

This is provided primarily as a decoupling mechanism, to allow modules to be
written that perform IO in an asynchronous manner to depend directly on this,
while allowing asynchronous event systems to provide an implementation of these
operations.
