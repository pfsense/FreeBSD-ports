Cirrus CLI is a tool for running containerized tasks reproducibly in any
environment. Most commonly, Cirrus tasks are used as part of continuous
integration workflows but can also be used as part of local development
process as a hermetic replacement of helper scripts/Makefiles. Cirrus
CLI runs your tasks locally the same way they are executed in CI or on
your colleague's machine. Immutability of containers ensures the tasks
will be executed the same way years from now regardless what versions
of packages you'll have locally.
