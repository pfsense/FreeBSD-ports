Term::Clui offers a high-level user interface to give the user of command-line
applications a consistent "look and feel". Its metaphor for the computer is as
a human-like conversation-partner, and as each question/response is completed
it is summarised onto one line, and remains on screen, so that the history of
the session gradually accumulates on the screen and is available for review, or
for cut/paste. This user interface can therefore be intermixed with standard
applications which write to STDOUT or STDERR, such as make, pgp, rcs etc.
