amber is a code search and replace tool written in Rust.
This tool is inspired by 'ack', 'ag', and other grep-like tools.

Features:
- Recursively search from the current directory
- Ignore VCS directories (.git, .hg, .svn, .bzr)
- Ignore binary files
- Output by the colored format

Large files (> 1MB by default) are divided and searched in parallel.

amber can replace a keyword over directories (traditionally by
`find ... | xargs sed -i '...'`) .
User can decide to do replacing or not interactively.
