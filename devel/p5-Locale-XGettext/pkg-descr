When using GNU gettext you often find yourself extracting translatable strings
from more or less exotic file formats that cannot be handled by xgettext from
the GNU gettext suite directly. This package simplifies the task of writing a
string extractor in Perl, Python, Java, Ruby or other languages by providing a
common base needed for such scripts.

Locale::XGettext is the base class for various string extractors. These string
extractors can be used as standalone programs on the command-line or as a module
as a part of other software.
