This package provides support for reading & writing Java .properties files (both
the simple line-oriented format and XML) with a simple API based on the json
module - though, for recovering Java addicts, it also includes a Properties
class intended to match the behavior of Java 8's java.util.Properties as much as
is Pythonically possible.
