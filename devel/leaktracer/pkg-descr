LeakTracer is a small tool for checking C++ programs for memory leaks.  Run
your program using the provided LeakCheck script.  It uses the LD_PRELOAD
feature to "overlay" some functions on top of your functions (no recompile
needed).

LeakTracer uses gdb to print out the exact line where memory was allocated
but not freed -- this means you have to free all dynamically allocated data.
LeakTracer also overrides the global operator new and operator delete --
this will give problems if you override them as well.

LeakTracer traces only new/delete calls; it does not look at traditional
malloc/free/realloc.
