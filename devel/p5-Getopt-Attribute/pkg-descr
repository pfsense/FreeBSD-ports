This module provides an attribute wrapper around Getopt::Long.  Instead of
declaring the options in a hash with references to the variables and subroutines
affected by the options, you can use the Getopt attribute on the variables and
subroutines directly.

As you can see from the Synopsis, the attribute takes an argument of the same
format as you would give as the hash key for Getopt::Long.  See the Getopt::Long
manpage for details.
