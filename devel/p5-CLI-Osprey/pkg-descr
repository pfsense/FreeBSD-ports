CLI::Osprey is a module to assist in writing commandline applications with M* OO
modules (Moose, Moo, Mo). With it, you structure your app as one or more
modules, which get instantiated with the commandline arguments as attributes.
Arguments are parsed using Getopt::Long::Descriptive, and both long and short
help messages as well as complete manual pages are automatically generated. An
app can be a single command with options, or have sub-commands (like git).
Sub-commands can be defined as modules (with options of their own) or as simple
coderefs.
