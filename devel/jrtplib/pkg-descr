JRTPLIB is an object-oriented RTP library written in C++ by Jori Liesenborgs.
It was partly developed for his thesis at the School for Knowledge Technology
(or 'School voor Kennistechnologie' in Dutch), a cooperation between the
'Limburgs Universitair Centrum' (LUC) and the 'Universiteit Maastricht' (UM).
