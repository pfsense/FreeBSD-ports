Python library to parse and apply unified diffs.

Features:

- Automatic correction of
    * Linefeeds according to patched file
    * Diffs broken by stripping trailing whitespace
    * a/ and b/ prefixes
- Single file, which is a command line tool and a library
- No dependencies outside Python stdlib
- Patch format detection (SVN, HG, GIT)
- Nice diffstat histogram

Things that don't work out of the box:

- File renaming, creation and removal
- Directory tree operations
- Version control specific properties
- Non-unified diff formats
