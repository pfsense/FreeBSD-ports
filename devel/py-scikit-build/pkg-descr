scikit-build is an improved build system generator for CPython
C/C++/Fortran/Cython extensions. It provides better support for additional
compilers, build systems, cross compilation, and locating dependencies and
their associated build requirements.

The scikit-build package is fundamentally just glue between the setuptools
Python module and CMake.
