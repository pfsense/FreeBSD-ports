 To use ViewVC, modify the configuration file located at
 %%PREFIX%%/viewvc/viewvc.conf.

 If no webserver was selected during installation, then
 a rc script for running ViewVC standalone is installed.
 To enable the standalone ViewVC server in rc.conf use
 parameter viewvc_enable="YES".

 You can also adjust the user which runs the ViewVC standalone
 server with the parameter "viewvc_user".

 If you want to run the ViewVC standalone server with another
 IP/PORT, use the parameter "viewvc_flags".

 To see all available parameters, use the command
 %%PREFIX%%/viewvc/bin/standalone.py --help


 To use ViewVC with Apache or lighttpd as a CGI script,
