This is the Microsoft Azure Cosmos Python SDK.

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database
service. With the click of a button, Azure Cosmos DB enables you to elastically
and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure's
geographic regions. You can elastically scale throughput and storage, and take
advantage of fast, single-digit-millisecond data access using your favorite API
among SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Tables, or Gremlin. Cosmos DB provides
comprehensive service level agreements (SLAs) for throughput, latency,
availability, and consistency guarantees, something no other database service
can offer.
