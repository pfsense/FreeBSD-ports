ODE is a free, industrial quality library for simulating articulated
rigid body dynamics - for example ground vehicles, legged creatures,
and moving objects in VR environments. It is fast, flexible, robust
and platform independent, with advanced joints, contact with friction,
and built-in collision detection.
