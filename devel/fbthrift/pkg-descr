Thrift is a serialization and RPC framework for service communication. Thrift
enables these features in all major languages, and there is strong support for
C++, Python, Hack, and Java. Most services at Facebook are written using Thrift
for RPC, and some storage systems use Thrift for serializing records on disk.
