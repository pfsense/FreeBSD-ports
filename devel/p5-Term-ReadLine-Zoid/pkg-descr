This package provides a set of modules that form an interactive input buffer
written in plain perl with minimal dependencies. It features almost all
key-bindings described in the posix spec for the sh(1) utility with some
extensions like multi-line editing; this includes a vi-command mode with a
save-buffer (for copy-pasting) and an undo-stack.
