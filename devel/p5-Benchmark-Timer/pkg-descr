Benchmark::Timer class allows you to time portions of code conveniently, as
well as benchmark code by allowing timings of repeated trials. It is perfect
for when you need more precise information about the running time of portions
of your code than the Benchmark module will give you, but don't want to go all
out and profile your code.
