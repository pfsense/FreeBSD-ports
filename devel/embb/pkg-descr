The Embedded Multicore Building Blocks (EMBB) are an easy to use yet
powerful and efficient C/C++ library for the development of parallel
applications. EMBB has been specifically designed for embedded systems and
the typical requirements that accompany them, such as real-time capability
and constraints on memory consumption. As a major advantage, low-level
operations are hidden in the library which relieves software developers
from the burden of thread management and synchronization. This not only
improves productivity of parallel software development, but also results
in increased reliability and performance of the applications.
