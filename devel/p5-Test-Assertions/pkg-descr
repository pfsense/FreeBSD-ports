Test::Assertions provides a convenient set of tools for constructing
tests, such as unit tests or run-time assertion checks (like C's
ASSERT macro).  Unlike some of the Test:: modules available on CPAN,
Test::Assertions is not limited to unit test scripts; for example
it can be used to check output is as expected within a benchmarking
script.  When it is used for unit tests, it generates output in the
standard form for CPAN unit testing (under Test::Harness).
