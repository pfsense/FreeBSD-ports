Test::Harness is limited to printing out its results. This makes analysis of
the test results difficult for anything but a human. To make it easier for
programs to work with test results, we provide Test::Harness::Straps. Instead
of printing the results, straps provide them as raw data. You can also
configure how the tests are to be run.
