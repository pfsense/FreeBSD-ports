This module is a compatibility wrapper around Date::Parse.

Provides a tool to process different combinations of dates and zones values.
If a date doesn't contain a timezone suffix, and zone parameter is not set,
then the timezone of the returned DateTime object will be set to the local
timezone. This is consistent with the behavior of Date::Parse.
If no zone is specified and the date string does specify a timezone/offset or
if a zone format cannot be parsed by DateTime::TimeZone, the returned
DateTime object will have UTC timezone.
