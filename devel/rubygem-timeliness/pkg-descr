Date/time parser for Ruby with the following features:
- Extensible with custom formats and tokens.
- It's pretty fast. Up to 60% faster than Time/Date parse method.
- Control the parser strictness.
- Control behaviour of ambiguous date formats (US vs European e.g. mm/dd/yy,
  dd/mm/yy).
- I18n support (for months), if I18n gem loaded.
- Fewer WTFs than Time/Date parse method.
- Has no dependencies.

Extracted from the validates_timeliness gem, it has been rewritten cleaner and
much faster. It's most suitable for when you need to control the parsing
behaviour. It's faster than the Time/Date class parse methods, so it has general
appeal.
