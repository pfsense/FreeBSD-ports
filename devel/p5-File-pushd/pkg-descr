File::pushd does a temporary chdir that is easily and automatically
reverted.  It works by creating a simple object that caches the original
working directory.  When the object is destroyed, the destructor calls
chdir to revert to the original working directory.  By storing the
object in a lexical variable with a limited scope, this happens
automatically at the end of the scope.
