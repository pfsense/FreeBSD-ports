parol is a LL(k) parser generator for Rust.

It's an installable command line tool that can generate complete parsers from
a single grammar description file including all AST data types you would
otherwise had to design by yourself. `parol` does this solely by analyzing your
language's grammar.

You can control the process of AST type generation. First you can mark elements
for omission in your AST. Also you can specify your own types for language
elements.

Language description and language implementation is strictly separated in
`parol`. Thus you can design your language's grammar without any need to process
anything because generated parsers function by default as acceptors. This
empowers you to do a real rapid prototyping of your grammar.
