Tickit is a high-level toolkit for creating full-screen terminal-based
interactive programs. It allows programs to be written in an abstracted way,
working with a tree of widget objects, to represent the layout of the interface
and implement its behaviours.

Its supported terminal features includes a rich set of rendering attributes
(bold, underline, italic, 256-colours, etc), support for mouse including wheel
and position events above the 224th column and arbitrary modified key input via
libtermkey (all of these will require a supporting terminal as well). It also
supports having multiple instances and non-blocking or asynchronous control.
