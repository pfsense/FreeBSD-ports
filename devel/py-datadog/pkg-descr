The Datadog Python Library is a collection of tools suitable for inclusion in
existing Python projects or for the development of standalone scripts. It
provides an abstraction on top of Datadog's raw HTTP interface and the Agent's
DogStatsD metrics aggregation server, to interact with Datadog and efficiently
report events and metrics.
