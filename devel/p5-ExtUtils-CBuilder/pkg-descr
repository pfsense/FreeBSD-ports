This module can build the C portions of Perl modules by invoking the
appropriate compilers and linkers in a cross-platform manner. It was motivated
by the Module::Build project, but may be useful for other purposes as well.
However, it is not intended as a general cross-platform interface to all your C
building needs. That would have been a much more ambitious goal!
