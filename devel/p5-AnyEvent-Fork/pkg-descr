AnyEvent::Fork allows you to create new processes, without actually forking them
from your current process (avoiding the problems of forking), but preserving
most of the advantages of fork.

It can be used to create new worker processes or new independent subprocesses
for short- and long-running jobs, process pools (e.g. for use in pre-forked
servers) but also to spawn new external processes (such as CGI scripts from a
web server), which can be faster (and more well behaved) than using fork+exec in
big processes.
