To get started with a minimal configuration,
add the following Lua to your configuration:

require "paq" {}

Or, start with declaring packages:

require "paq" {
  "user_alice/ucl_all_things.nvim",
  "user_bob/nvtree_all_things.nvim",
}

Plugin commands:
:PaqClean   - Remove all packages that are not listed in your configuration.
:PaqInstall - Install all packages listed in your configuration.
:PaqList    - List managed packages.
:PaqSync    - Execute commands PaqInstall, PaqUpdate, and PaqClean.
:PaqUpdate  - Update all packages already on your system.

Upon first usage, you will have to run PaqUpdate to populate your runtime, and
again when the Port is updated. See :help paq for more information.
