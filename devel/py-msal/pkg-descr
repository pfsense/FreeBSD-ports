The Microsoft Authentication Library for Python enables applications to
integrate with the Microsoft identity platform. It allows you to sign in users
or apps with Microsoft identities (Azure AD, Microsoft Accounts and Azure AD
B2C accounts) and obtain tokens to call Microsoft APIs such as Microsoft Graph
or your own APIs registered with the Microsoft identity platform. It is built
using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols.
