Class names in Perl often don't sound great when spoken, or look good
when written in prose.  For this reason, we tend to say things like
"customer" or "basket" when we are referring to My::Site::User::Customer
or My::Site::Shop::Basket.  We thought it would be nice if our classes
knew what we would prefer to call them.

This module will add a moniker (and plural_moniker) method to UNIVERSAL,
and so to every class or module.

So, if $ob->isa("Big::Scary::Animal"), moniker will return "animal";
$ob->isa("Cephalopod::Octopus"), plural_moniker will return "octopuses".
