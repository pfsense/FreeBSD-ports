SVN::Web provides a web interface to subversion repositories. You can
browse the tree, view history of a directory or a file, see what's
changed in a specific revision, track changes with RSS, and also view
diff.

SVN::Web also tracks the branching feature (node copy) of subversion,
so you can easily see the relationship between branches.
