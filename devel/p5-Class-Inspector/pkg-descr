Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class. Most or all
of this information can be found in other ways, but they aren't always very
friendly, and usually involve a relatively high level of Perl wizardry, or
strange and unusual looking code. Class::Inspector attempts to provide an
easier, more friendly interface to this information.
