pyudev is a LGPL licensed, pure Python binding for libudev, the device
and hardware management and information library for Linux. It supports
almost all libudev functionality. You can enumerate devices, query
device properties and attributes or monitor devices, including
asynchronous monitoring with threads, or within the event loops of Qt,
Glib or wxPython.
