The buf CLI is the tool for working with Protocol Buffers. It provides:
* A linter that enforces good API design choices and structure.
* A breaking change detector that enforces compatibility at the source code
  or wire level.
* A generator that invokes your plugins based on configurable templates.
* A formatter that formats your Protobuf files in accordance with industry
  standards.
* Integration with the Buf Schema Registry, including full dependency
  management.
