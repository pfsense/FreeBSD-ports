# libutp - The uTorrent Transport Protocol library.
Copyright (c) 2010 BitTorrent, Inc.

uTP provides provides reliable, ordered delivery while maintaining
minimum extra delay. It is implemented on top of UDP to be
cross-platform and functional today. As a result, uTP is the primary
transport for uTorrent peer-to-peer connections.

uTP is written in C++, but the external interface is strictly C
(ANSI C89).
