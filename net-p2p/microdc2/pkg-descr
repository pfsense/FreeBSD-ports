microdc is a command-line based Direct Connect client written in C by Oskar
Liljeblad and designed to build and run on modern POSIX compatible systems.
It uses GNU Readline library for user interaction.  Despite the command-line
user interface, microdc is quite user friendly and simple to use.

microdc2 is a future improvement (fork) of the microdc based on Oskar's code
version 0.11.0.  After version 0.12.0 the project was renamed to microdc2 on
Oskar's request.

Features of microdc2 include:

  - Nearly full support of the original Direct Connect protocol
  - GNU Readline support for command line editing and history
  - Sensible tab-completion of commands, user names, local files, remote
    files, speed names, and connection names
  - One process per connection for optimal transfer rates
  - Small memory footprint
