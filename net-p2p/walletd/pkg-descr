walletd is the flagship Sia wallet, suitable for miners, exchanges,
and everyday hodlers. Its client-server architecture gives you the
flexibility to access your funds from anywhere, on any device, without
compromising the security of your private keys. The server is
agnostic, so you can derive those keys from a 12-word seed phrase, a
legacy (siad) 28-word phrase, a Ledger hardware wallet, or another
preferred method. Like other Foundation node software, walletd ships
with a slick embedded UI, but developers can easily build headless
integrations leveraging its powerful JSON API. Whether you're using a
single address or millions, walletd scales to your needs.
