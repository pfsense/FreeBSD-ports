Ethereum is a community-driven project aiming to decentralize the internet and
return it to its democratic roots. It is a platform for building and running
applications which do not need to rely on trust and cannot be controlled by
any central authority.

This is the Go implementation of the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain.
