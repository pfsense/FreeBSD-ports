Arbitrum is a Layer 2 cryptocurrency platform that makes smart contracts
scalable, fast, and private. Arbitrum interoperates closely with Ethereum,
so Ethereum developers can easily cross-compile their contracts to run on
Arbitrum. Arbitrum achieves these goals through a unique combination of
incentives, network protocol design, and virtual machine architecture.
