To allow clients to connect to the transmission daemon using DNS with
any hostname other than localhost, do one of the following:
  - Enable password authentication, then any hostname is allowed.
    This can be achieved by either:
      - setting rpc-authentication-required to true, and adding
        credentials to the rpc-username and rpc-password fields in
        settings.json (must be done whilst the transmission service is
        stopped); or
      - running transmission-daemon with the following arguments
        (these can be set with transmission_flags in /etc/rc.conf):
        -t -u USERNAME -v PASSWORD
  OR
  - Add the allowed server hostnames to the rpc-host-whitelist setting
    in settings.json (must be done whilst the transmission service is
    stopped). Note that this value is NOT a list of allowed CLIENTS,
    but instead a list of allowed SERVER hostnames.
