To run a server, copy any files you wish to share into /var/db/libswift,
ensure that it is read and writable by the appropriate user, and
start the libswift daemon:

# service libswift onestart

To retrieve a file, use:

$ libswift --tracker  127.0.0.1:7777 --hash ....

To view the root hashes, use `grep root *.mbinmap` in the share dir once
hashing is complete. For large files this may take some time.
