TorrentSniff is a command line Perl program that reads a BitTorrent .torrent
file from the local file system or from a URL and reports on the status of the
torrent.

TorrentSniff is based on an early version of TorrentSpy. Reporting seed and
leech numbers works only with some tracker implementations.
