[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

The minder is a small network application for automatic maintenance
of peer lists. The application accepts connections from other network
entities ("minions") and returns a list of other identitical minions.

When a minion contacts the minder, the minion supplies its type,
network port and address, and its unique node identification.

The framework for building a minion is included in the C++ Sockets
Library. The framework consists of classes representing connections
between minion-minder and minion-minion, and also a controller class
for them both.

The minder itself is also built with the C++ Sockets Library as its
foundation.
