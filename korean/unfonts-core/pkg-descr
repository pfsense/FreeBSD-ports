Un-series fonts (GPL'd) are made by UN Koaunghi (who painstakingly
scanned, converted to outlines and hand-hinted them all) and PARK
Won-Kyu. They're originally made as PS fonts to use with Korean
TeX/LaTeX/OmegaLambda (HLaTeX [1]) by UN Koaunghi in the late 1990's.
Recently, PARK Won-kyu converted them to truetype fonts and added
GSUB tables to one of them (UnBatang) for the full support of
Korean script with Korean letters (Hangul Jamos : U+1100).
