Source Han Sans: A new open source Pan-CJK typeface family from Adobe

This is Source Han Sans K/KR, which supports all four variants in this family
but prioritizes Korean Hanja over other three.

"Source Han Sans, available in seven weights, is a typeface family which
provides full support for Japanese, Korean, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified
Chinese, all in one font. It also includes Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic glyphs
from our popular Source Sans family. All told, each font weight in the family
has a total of 65,535 glyphs (the maximum supported in the OpenType format), and
the entire family rounds out at just under half a million total glyphs."
