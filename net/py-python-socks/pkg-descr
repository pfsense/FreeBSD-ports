The python-socks package provides a core proxy client functionality for
Python. Supports SOCKS4(a), SOCKS5, HTTP (tunneling) proxy and provides sync
and async (asyncio, trio, curio) APIs. You probably don't need to use
python-socks directly. It is used internally by aiohttp-socks and httpx-socks
packages.
