This module is an implementation of the BGP-4 inter-domain routing protocol. It
encapsulates all of the functionality needed to establish and maintain a BGP
peering session and exchange routing update information with the peer. It aims
to provide a simple API to the BGP protocol for the purposes of automation,
logging, monitoring, testing, and similar tasks using the power and flexibility
of perl. The module does not implement the functionality of a RIB (Routing
Information Base) nor does it modify the kernel routing table of the host
system. However, such operations could be implemented using the API provided by
the module.
