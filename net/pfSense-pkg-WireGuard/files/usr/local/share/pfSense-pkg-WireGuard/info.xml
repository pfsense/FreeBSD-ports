		<descr><![CDATA[WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN&lt;br /&gt;
				that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be&lt;br /&gt;
				faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while&lt;br /&gt;
				avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably&lt;br /&gt;
				more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a&lt;br /&gt;
				general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and&lt;br /&gt;
				super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;
				Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now&lt;br /&gt;
				cross-platform and widely deployable. It is currently under&lt;br /&gt;
				heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the&lt;br /&gt;
				most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in&lt;br /&gt;
				the industry.]]></descr>
