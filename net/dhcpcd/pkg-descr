dhcpcd is a DHCP/IPv4LL/IPv6RS/DHCPv6 client.
It can also act as a network manager, responding to new interfaces,
listening for carrier up/down events and managing routes.

dhcpcd-9 introduces a number of security improvements:
- privilege separation
  operations are performed across multiple processes, and those which do
  not require root privileges are run as the unprivileged _dhcp user
- sanboxed with capsicum(4)
  processes run in capability mode, limiting their access and therefore
  the potential impact of security vulnerabilities
