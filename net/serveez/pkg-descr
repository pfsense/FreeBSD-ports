Serveez is a server framework. It provides routines and help for
implementing IP based servers (currently TCP, UDP and ICMP). It is also
possible to use named pipes for all connection oriented protocols. We
think it is worth the effort because many people need server
functionality within their applications.  However, many people
experience problems with select()- or poll()-loops, and with
non-blocking operations. This application demonstrates various aspects
of advanced network programming in a portable manner. You can use it for
implementing your own servers or for understanding how certain network
services and operations work. The package includes a number of servers
that work already: an HTTP server, an IRC server, a Gnutella spider and
some others.  One of the highlights is that you can run all protocols on
the same port. The application itself is single threaded but it uses
helper processes for concurrent name resolution and ident lookups.
