tac_plus is a TACACS+ daemon. It provides Cisco Systems routers and
access servers with authentication, authorisation and accounting services.

This version is a major rewrite of the original Cisco source code.
Key features include:
- NAS specific host keys, prompts, enable passwords
- NAS- and ACL-dependent group memberships
- Flexible external backends for user profiles (e.g. via PERL scripts or C;
 LDAP (including ActiveDirectory), RADIUS and others are included )
- Connection multiplexing (multiple concurrent NAS clients per process)
- Session multiplexing
- Scalable, no limit on users, clients or servers
- CLI context aware. At the time of writing this, no other TACACS+ daemon is.
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 are fully supported.
- Compliant to latest TACACS+ protocol specification (draft 1.78)
