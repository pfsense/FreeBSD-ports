The implementation of the Wifibox embedded wireless router is based on
the use of a Linux-based guest operating system which can communicate
with the host's wireless network card on behalf of the host.  In order
to meet the requirements, this has to be a system with a low resource
footprint and easy to manage.  This is derived from Alpine Linux,
which is an actively maintained, security-oriented, lightweight
distribution, based on musl libc and BusyBox.
