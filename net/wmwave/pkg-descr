From the README on the website:

wmwave is dockapp for window maker to display statistical information
about a current wireless ethernet connection. The current release
is Version 0.4. wmwave has been tested under Redhat 5.2 with an
Wavelan Silver WEP/IEEE card from Lucent Technologies.

I have rewritten the network code for use with Bill Paul's wi(4)
driver as it appears in FreeBSD 5.0-CURRENT and 4.4-STABLE. Support
for other cards will not be integrated into this GPLed version.
