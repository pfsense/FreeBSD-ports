This module implements remote procedure call. I've tried to keep things simple.

So this module should be:
- quite simple to use (thanks to autoload mechanisms)
- lightweight

It sure is not:
- DCE
- CORBA
- bulletproof
- securityproof
- foolproof

But it works. (Although I'm opened to suggestion regarding the "un-proof" areas)
