Virtual Distributed Ethernet is a user-mode virtual network (layer
2) infrastructure.  It can be used for network simulations, joining
multiple qemu instances together in a shared virtual network, or
tunneling over the Internet.  Physical hosts can be joined to the
virtual network by means of the tap(4) driver.
