Easy, direct connections that punch through NATs & stay connected as
network conditions change.

Dumbpipe is inspired by the unix tool netcat. While netcat works with IP
addresses, dumbpipe works with 256 bit node ids and therefore is
somewhat location transparent. In addition, connections are encrypted
using TLS.
