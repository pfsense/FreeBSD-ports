A Python framework for writing ICAP servers (RFC 3507).

ICAP is a protocol that is used by HTTP proxies to ask a separate service (an
ICAP server) to do modification on HTTP requests and responses it proxies. Such
proxy is an ICAP client.
ICAP can be used to check permissions, scan viruses, place ads or otherwise
modify the headers, content or request URL or HTTP requests and/or responses.
These can be done without modifying the proxy server's code.

The popular proxy software Squid 3.x supports the ICAP protocol, and this
framework was tested with Squid3.
