ldapdiff combines "diff" and "patch" functionality in one application.
The difference is that ldapdiff is not designed for use on flat ascii
files, it is designed for "patching" ldap directories using ldif files.

With ldapdiff it is possible to check every entry/attribute of an ldif
file against a running ldap directory. ldapdiff is able to produce ldif
delta files in ldap version 3 format, which can be fed, into tools like
"ldapmodify", "ldapdelete" etc. ldapdiff is also able to modify, delete
and add entries/attributes online.
