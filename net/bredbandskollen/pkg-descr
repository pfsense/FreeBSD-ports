Bredbandskollen (broad band check in English) is a tool to test the speed of
internet connections.  The tool is made available from the Internet Foundation
In Sweden.

This is a command line tool that can be used instead of the web application
for bandwidth tests in Sweden (see https://bredbandskollen.se for details).
