Rose::URI is an alternative to URI. It provides a rich set of query string
manipulation methods. Query parameters can be added, removed, and checked
for their existence. URI allows the entire query to be set or returned as
a whole via the query_form or query methods, and the URI::QueryParam module
provides a few more methods for query string manipulation.
