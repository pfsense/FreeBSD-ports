    Kafka KRaft mode is marked as production ready since v3.3.1.
    If you want to start using KRaft mode be aware that there are
    separate configs in %%ETCDIR%%/kraft directory.
    The data logs will be stored in %%KAFKA_DBDIR%%/kraft directory by default.
    So set kafka_config="%%ETCDIR%%/kraft/server.properties" in /etc/rc.conf
    to get started with KRaft mode.
