This module implements the frame (de)serialization and representation
of the Advanced Message Queue Protocol (http://www.amqp.org/).

It is to be used in conjunction with client or server software that
does the actual TCP/IP communication. While it's being written with
AMQP version 0-8 in mind, as the spec is defined by an external xml
file, support for 0-9, 0-9-1 and eventually 0-10 is hoped for.
