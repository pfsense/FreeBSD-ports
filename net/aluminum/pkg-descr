Aluminum provides a generic interface to high-performance communication
libraries, with a focus on allreduce algorithms. Blocking and non-blocking
algorithms and GPU-aware algorithms are supported. Aluminum also contains
custom implementations of select algorithms to optimize for certain situations.
