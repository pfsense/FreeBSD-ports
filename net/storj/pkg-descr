Storj is an S3-compatible platform and suite of decentralized applications
that allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner.  Your
files are encrypted, broken into little pieces, and stored in a global
decentralized network of computers.  Luckily, we also support allowing you
(and only you) to retrieve those files!
