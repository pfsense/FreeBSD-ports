Based on Net::Whois, Net::ParseWhois was written with the intent to provide a
replacement for the (broken) Net::Whois module. It is otherwise different to
Net::Whois in that it a) is easily extendable b) has a work-around approach
rather than wanting/expecting/wishing registrars to standardize their output.
