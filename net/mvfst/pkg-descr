mvfst (Pronounced move fast) is a client and server implementation of IETF QUIC
protocol in C++ by Facebook. QUIC is a UDP based reliable, multiplexed transport
protocol that will become an internet standard. The goal of mvfst is to build a
performant implementation of the QUIC transport protocol that applications could
adapt for use cases on both the internet and the data-center. mvfst has been
tested at scale on android, iOS apps, as well as servers and has several
features to support large scale deployments.
