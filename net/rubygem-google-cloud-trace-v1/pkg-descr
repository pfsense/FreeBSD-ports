Ruby Client for the Cloud Trace V1 API

Sends application trace data to Stackdriver Trace for viewing. Trace data is
collected for all App Engine applications by default. Trace data from other
applications can be provided using this API. This library is used to interact
with the Trace API directly. If you are looking to instrument your application
for Stackdriver Trace, we recommend using OpenTelemetry.

The Cloud Trace API lets you send and retrieve latency data to and from Cloud
Trace. This API provides low-level interfaces for interacting directly with the
feature. For some languages, you can use OpenTelemetry, a set of open source
tracing and stats instrumentation libraries that work with multiple backends.
