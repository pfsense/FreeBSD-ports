This code forms a set of C++ libraries for multimedia streaming,
using open standard protocols (RTP/RTCP and RTSP). These libraries
- which can be compiled for Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X),
Windows, and QNX(and other POSIX-compliant systems) - can be used
to build streaming applications. The libraries are already being
used to implement applications such as "liveCaster" and "playRTPMPEG"
(for streaming MP3 audio using RTP/RTCP). The libraries can also
be used to stream, receive, and process MPEG video, and can easily be
extended to support additional (audio and/or video) codecs. They can
also be used to build basic RTSP clients and servers, and have been
used to add streaming support to existing media player applications,
such as "mplayer".
