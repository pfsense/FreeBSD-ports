POEx::Role::TCPServer bundles up the lower level
SocketFactory/ReadWrite combination of wheels into a simple
Moose::Role. It builds upon other POEx modules such as
POEx::Role::SessionInstantiation and POEx::Types.

The events for SocketFactory for and for each ReadWrite instantiated
are methods that can be advised in any way deemed fit. Advising these
methods is actually encouraged and can simplify code for the consumer.

The only method that must be provided by the consuming class is
handle_inbound_data.
