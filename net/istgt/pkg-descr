This software (istgt) is the implementation of iSCSI target (refer to RFC3720
about iSCSI) for FreeBSD.

It includes iSCSI protocol processor and SPC-3 (SCSI Primary Commands - 3)
based logical unit emulation.  You can easily create over 2TB storage for
iSCSI target.  If necessary, you can configure to use multipath failover or
MCS failover.
