Rospo is a tool meant to create reliable ssh tunnels.  It embeds an SSH
server too if you want to reverse proxy a secured shell.

It's meant to make ssh tunnels fun and understandable again.

Rospo supports a cool UI, too. The UI lets you handle tunnel and
pipe configuration at runtime through a web interface. You can
start/stop new tunnels and pipes at runtime.
