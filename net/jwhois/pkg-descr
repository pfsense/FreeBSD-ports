Jwhois is a WHOIS client, with a feature of selecting servers to
query based on a configulation file. Query results are cached to local
databases. If you make a same query later, the results are extracted
from databases; you can get your answer quickly.

This version is based on Fedora jwhois 4.0-73.fc38.
