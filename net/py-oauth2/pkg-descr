This code was originally forked from Leah Culver and Andy Smith's
oauth.py code (see net/py-oauth).

A number of notable differences exist between this code and its
forefathers:

  * 100% unit test coverage.
  * The DataStore object has been completely ripped out.
  * Classes are no longer prefixed with OAuth.
  * The Request class now extends from dict.
  * The library is likely no longer compatible with Python 2.3.
  * The Client class works and extends from httplib2.
