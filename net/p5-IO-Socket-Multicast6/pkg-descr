The IO::Socket::Multicast6 module subclasses IO::Socket::INET6 to enable you to
manipulate multicast groups. With this module you will be able to receive
incoming multicast transmissions and generate your own outgoing multicast
packets.

This module uses the same API as IO::Socket::Multicast, but with added support
for IPv6 (IPv4 is still supported). Unlike IO::Socket::Multicast, this is a
pure-perl module.
