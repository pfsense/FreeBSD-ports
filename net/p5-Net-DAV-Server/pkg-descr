This module provides a WebDAV server. WebDAV stands for "Web-based
Distributed Authoring and Versioning". It is a set of extensions to
the HTTP protocol which allows users to collaboratively edit and
manage files on remote web servers.

Net::DAV::Server provides a WebDAV server and exports a filesystem for
you using the Filesys::Virtual suite of modules. If you simply want to
export a local filesystem, use Filesys::Virtual::Plain as above.

This module doesn't currently provide a full WebDAV implementation.
However, I am working through the WebDAV server protocol compliance
test suite (litmus, see http://www.webdav.org/neon/litmus/) and will
provide more compliance in future. The important thing is that it
supports cadaver and the Mac OS X Finder as clients.
