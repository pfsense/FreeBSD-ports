Please set the hostname of your fiche server by running:
sysrc fiche_domain="mypaste.domain.com"

You'll still need a separate webserver configured to serve the content that
fiche produces in %%WWWDIR%%.

An example nginx config may be found here:

If you wish to serve the content over HTTPS, please run the following to
ensure that fiche hands out URLs prefixed with https://:

sysrc fiche_flags="-S"
