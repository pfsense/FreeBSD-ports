GUPnP is an elegant, object-oriented open source framework for creating UPnP
devices and control points, written in C using GObject and libsoup. The GUPnP
API is intended to be easy to use, efficient and flexible. It provides the same
set of features as libupnp, but shields the developer from most of UPnP's
internals.

GUPnP implements the UPnP specification: resource announcement and discovery,
description, control, event notification, and presentation (GUPnP includes basic
web server functionality through libsoup). GUPnP does not include helpers for
construction or control of specific standardized resources (e.g. MediaServer);
this is left for higher level libraries utilizing the GUPnP framework.
