quiche is an implementation of the QUIC transport protocol and HTTP/3
as specified by the IETF.

It provides a low level API for processing QUIC packets and handling
connection state. The application is responsible for providing I/O
(e.g. sockets handling) as well as an event loop with support for timers.
