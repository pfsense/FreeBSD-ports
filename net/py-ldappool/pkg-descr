ldappool keeps LDAP connectors alive and let you reuse them, drastically
reducing the time spent to initiate a ldap connection.

The pool has useful features like:

- transparent reconnection on failures or server restarts
- configurable pool size and connectors timeouts
- configurable max lifetime for connectors
- a context manager to simplify acquiring and releasing a connector
