Tableutil is a utility for converting, aggregating and performing operations
on lists of IP-addresses. Its primary use is to convert files into a format
pfctl(8) can read.

It can read plain-text-files with ranges (123.123.123.123-234.234.234.234),
CIDR-style networks (192.168.0.0/24) single addresses (242.242.242.242) or
with hostnames (one.two.com). It can also read p2b files.
