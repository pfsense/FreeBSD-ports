msoak is a utility with which to simultaneously subscribe to an
arbitrary number of topics on any number of MQTT brokers and
optionally modify or normalize received payloads before printing
them out. This utility was created to back up to a central location
messages received by a handfull of brokers, instead of launching
(and having to monitor success of) a large number of mosquitto_sub(1)
programs.
