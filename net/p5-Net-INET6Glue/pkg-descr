Net::INET6Glue is a collection of modules to make common modules IPv6
ready by hotpatching them.

Unfortunatly the current state of IPv6 support in perl is that no IPv6
support is in the core and that a lot of important modules (like
Net::FTP, Net::SMTP, LWP,...) do not support IPv6 even if the modules
for IPv6 sockets Socket6, IO::Socket::INET6 are available.

This module tries to mitigate this by hotpatching.
