DHCPerf Provides Communication Providers with Predictive Planning
Tools to Scale Networks.

This tool, DHCPerf, delivers accurate performance metrics
of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) services.  These tools
are easy-to-use and simulate real Internet workloads to provide the
necessary insight that carriers need to plan and deploy network
services.

DHCPerf measures the DHCP lease assignments to client computers by
ramping up lease assignment over time to determine the maximum
performance profile.
