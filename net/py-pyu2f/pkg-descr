pyu2f is a python based U2F host library. It provides functionality for
interacting with a U2F device over USB.

pyu2f uses ctypes to make system calls directly to interface with the USB HID
device. This means that no platform specific shared libraries need to be
compiled for pyu2f to work.

By default pyu2f will use its own U2F stack implementation to sign requests. If
desired, pyu2f can offload signing to a pluggable command line tool. Offloading
is not yet supported for U2F registration.
