XML::Compile::WSDL11 understands WSDL version 1.1. An WSDL file defines a set of
messages to be send and received over (SOAP) connections. This involves encoding
of the message to be send into XML, sending the message to the server, collect
the answer, and finally decoding the XML to Perl.

As end-user, you do not have to worry about the complex details of the messages
and the way to exchange them: it's all simple Perl for you. Also, faults are
handled automatically. The only complication you have to worry about is to shape
a nested HASH structure to the sending message structure.
XML::Compile::Schema::template() may help you.

When the definitions are spread over multiple files you will need to use
addWSDL() (wsdl) or importDefinitions() (additional schema's) explicitly.
Usually, interreferences between those files are broken. Often they reference
over networks (you should never trust). So, on purpose you must explicitly load
the files you need from local disk! (of course, it is simple to find one-liners
as work-arounds, but I will to tell you how!)
