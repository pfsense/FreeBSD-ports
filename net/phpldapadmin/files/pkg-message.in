Please edit config.php to suit your needs.

To make phpLDAPadmin available through your web site, I suggest that
you add something like the following to httpd.conf:

    Alias /phpldapadmin/ "%%WWWDIR%%/htdocs/"

    <Directory "%%WWWDIR%%/htdocs">
        Options none
        AllowOverride none

        Order Deny,Allow
        Deny from all
        Allow from 127.0.0.1 .example.com
    </Directory>
EOM
}
]
