Net_LDAP is a clone of Perls Net::LDAP object interface to directory servers. It
does contain most of Net::LDAPs features but has some own too.

With Net_LDAP you have:
- A simple object-oriented interface to connections, searches entries and
  filters.
- Support for tls and ldap v3.
- Simple modification, deletion and creation of ldap entries.
- Support for schema handling.

Net_LDAP layers itself on top of PHP's existing ldap extensions.
