fbzmq provides a framework for writing services in C++ while leveraging the
awesomeness of libzmq (message passing semantics). At a high level it provides:

* Lightweight C++ wrapper over libzmq which leverages newer C++ constructs and
  stricter type checking. Most notably it provides the ability to send/receive
  thrift objects as messages over wire without worrying about wire
  encoding/decoding protocols.
* Powerful Async Framework with EventLoop, Timeouts, SignalHandler and more to
  enable developers to write asynchronous applications efficiently.
* Suite of monitoring tools that make it easy to add logging and counters to
  your service.
* RPC, and some storage systems use Thrift for serializing records on disk.
