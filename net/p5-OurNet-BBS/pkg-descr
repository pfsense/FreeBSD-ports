OurNet-BBS is a cross-protocol distributed network, built as an
abstraction layer over telnet BBS-based systems used in Hong Kong,
China and Taiwan. It implements a flexible object model for different
BBS backends, along with an asymmetric authentication and remote
procedure call protocol.

This project aims to become a protocol agnostic middle-ware solution
for identity-based information storage & retrieval, much like the
Project Jabber's goal toward instant messaging, or Project JXTA's aim
toward distributed services.

If you are new to the telnet-bbs platform, please download a copy of
Melix BBS software (in English, Traditional Chinese and Simplified
Chinese) at http://melix.elixus.org/.

For some of its practical uses, search for OurNet::BBSApp on CPAN, and
the sample scripts in the eg/ directory in this module's distribution.
