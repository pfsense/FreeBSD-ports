RSocket is a binary protocol for use on byte stream transports such as TCP,
WebSockets, and Aeron.

It enables the following symmetric interaction models via async message passing
over a single connection:
* request/response (stream of 1)
* request/stream (finite stream of many)
* fire-and-forget (no response)
* channel (bi-directional streams)
