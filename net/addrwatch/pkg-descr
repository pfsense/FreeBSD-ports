addrwatch is a similar software to arpwatch. It main purpose is to
monitor network and log ethernet/ip pairings.

To simply try out addrwatch start it without any arguments. When
started without arguments it will open first non loopback interface and
start logging events to the console without writing anything to disk.
All discovered ethernet/ip address pairings will be printed to stdout.
All debug, warning, and err messages will be sent to syslog and printed
to stderr.
