Socketpipe connects over a TCP/IP socket a remote command to a local
input generation command and/or a local output processing command.
The connection is made by redirecting the input/output file descriptors
to the socket.  This saves the context switching and data copying
overhead associated with piping data through ssh(1) or rsh(1).
Socketpipe must be installed on both machines and user authentication
is still performed by a command like ssh(1) or rsh(1).  The
confidentiality and integrity of the data in transit is not protected
against malicious attacks; the command is designed for use in a
trusted LAN environment.
