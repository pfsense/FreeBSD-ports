{ type: install
  message: <<EOM
The configuration files are installed in %%PREFIX%%/etc/serviio --
but only the logging configuration and the player device-profiles
may be changed there -- the library is set via the GUI program
serviio-console (see below).

The database will be located under /var/db/serviio/.

Remember to set serviio_enable=YES in /etc/rc.conf for the service to
start at boot. It will run as user ``%%USER%%''.

When the server is running, run the %%PREFIX%%/bin/serviio-console (a
GUI program) on the same host -- as yourself -- to configure it.

From http://www.serviio.org/component/content/article/21#q2 :
If you'd like to manage the service from a remote host, add

	serviio_args=-Dserviio.remoteHost=yo.ur.local.ip

to rc.conf. Note, that there is NO AUTHENTICATION between console and
the server processes.
