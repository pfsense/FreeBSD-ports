POE::Component::Client::Whois provides a lightweight one shot non-blocking
RFC 812 WHOIS query to other POE sessions and components. The component will
attempt to guess the appropriate whois server to connect to based on the
query string passed.

If no guess can be made it will connect to whois.internic.net for domains,
whois.arin.net for IPv4 addresses and whois.6bone.net for IPv6 addresses.
