Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network. This
means that you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and instantly be
able to view other people who you can chat with, find printers to print to or
find files being shared. This kind of technology is already found in Apple Mac
OS X (branded Rendezvous, Bonjour and sometimes Zeroconf) and is very
convenient. Avahi is mainly based on Lennart Poettering's flexmdns mDNS
implementation for Linux which has been discontinued in favour of Avahi.
