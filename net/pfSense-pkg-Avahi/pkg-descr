Avahi is a system which facilitates host and service discovery in local
networks via mDNS (Multicast DNS) and DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery).
This package allows mDNS/DNS-SD protocols to work across multiple LAN
segments. mDNS/DNS-SD is known in Apple circles as "Bounjour" and is
part of the Zeroconf suite of protocols.
