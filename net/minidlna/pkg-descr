MiniDLNA (aka ReadyDLNA) is server software with the aim of being
fully compliant with DLNA/UPnP-AV clients.

The media files are listed in an SQLite database allowing prompt
restarts.

This is Gleb Smirnoff's fork of original project by Justin Maggard,
created [temporarily] due to low activity of main project.
