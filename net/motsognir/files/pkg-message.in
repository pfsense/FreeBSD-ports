Please configure Motsognir using

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/motsognir.conf


Add the following line to /etc/rc.conf to enable Motsognir:

  motsognir_enable="YES"


Then you can start Motsognir daemon by issuing the following command:

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/motsognir start


You might need to add the following line to /etc/syslog.conf

  daemon.*                                        /var/log/daemon.log

if you want to keep log informations of Motsognir. Some of them go to
/var/log/messages, but connection informations go to LOG_INFO.
Since version 1.0.12 you can also configure the log facility
(see LogFacility in motsognir.conf).


Motsognir will serve files in /var/gopher/ per default.


Note that Motsognir tries to use an inet6/ipv6 socket. Therefore it needs
access to an interface where ipv6 is enabled (for instance if you run
Motsognir in a jail). This holds even if you want to bind it to an ipv4
address.
Since version 1.0.11 you can disable IPv6 (see disableipv6 in
motsognir.conf).
