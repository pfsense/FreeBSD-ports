This is the ported version of the pipsecd program
from Pierre Beyssac at the ENST.

The main difference with the original code are:
- it compiles with OpenSSL-0.94
- config files are in /usr/local/etc/ipsec


Apart from that it works exactly as the original work from
Pierre Beyssac.

You can obtain the source distribution of pipsecd at:
http://www.enst.fr/~beyssac/tunip.tar.gz

Enjoy!
