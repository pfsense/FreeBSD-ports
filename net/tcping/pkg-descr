tcping does a TCP connect to the given ip/port combination. The user can specify
a timeout in seconds. This is useful in shell scripts running in firewalled
environments. Often SYNs are just being dropped by firewalls, thus connection
establishment will be retried several times (for minutes) until a TCP timeout is
reached. With tcping it is possible to check first if the desired port is
reachable and then start connection establishment.
