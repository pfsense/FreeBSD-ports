WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes
state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and
more useful than IPSec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to
be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a
general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers
alike, fit for many different circumstances.

This package does not contain anything by itself - it is a "meta-port" that
depends on other wireguard packages.
