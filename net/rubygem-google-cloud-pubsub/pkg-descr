Google Cloud Pub/Sub (docs) is designed to provide reliable, many-to-many,
asynchronous messaging between applications. Publisher applications can send
messages to a "topic" and other applications can subscribe to that topic to
receive the messages. By decoupling senders and receivers, Google Cloud Pub/Sub
allows developers to communicate between independently written applications.
