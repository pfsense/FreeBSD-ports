  Description
  -----------

    Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP port
    and do network I/O, especially with a port using the TELNET
    protocol.  Simple I/O methods such as print, get, and getline are
    provided.  More sophisticated interactive features are provided
    because connecting to a TELNET port ultimately means communicating
    with a program designed for human interaction.  Some interactive
    features include the ability to specify a timeout and to wait for
    patterns to appear in the input stream, such as the prompt from a
    command interpreter.
