OpenStackClient (aka OSC) is a command-line client for OpenStack that brings the
command set for Compute, Identity, Image, Network, Object Store and Block
Storage APIs together in a single shell with a uniform command structure.

The primary goal is to provide a unified shell command structure and a common
language to describe operations in OpenStack.
