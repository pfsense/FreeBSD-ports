LeProxy is designed for anonymous surfing, improved security and privacy
plus circumventing geoblocking.  It allows you to enjoy the web like it
was meant to work and access your favorite online video platform without
annoying country blocks while traveling.

LeProxy is a powerful, lightweight, fast and simple to use proxy server
that you can host on your own server or PC at home and then access from
anywhere.  It supports optional authentication so you can share a server
instance with your family and friends without having to worry about
third parties.  It provides compatibility with a large number of clients
and services by accepting both common HTTP and SOCKS proxy protocols on
a single listening port.
