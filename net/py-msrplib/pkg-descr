The MSRP protocol stack implementation for clients written in python.

Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is a protocol for transmitting
a series of related instant messages in the context of a session.
Message sessions are treated like any other media stream
when set up via a rendezvous or session creation protocol
such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
