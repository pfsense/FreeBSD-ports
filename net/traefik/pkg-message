Note that traefik starts as unpriviliged user. Thus, it cannot
bind to privileged ports (by default, ports below 1024) and
will exit when configured to do so.

If traefik should serve ports in the privileged range, there
are options to achieve this:
- Have traffic bind to an unprivileged port and use the
  packet filter configuration to redirect requests to the
  desired privileged port to the unprivileged port in
  traefik's configuration file e.g. the rdr rules in pf(4).
- The mac_portacl kernel module allows unprivileged processes
  to bind to privileged ports.

The version 2 of Traefik requires manual configuration changes
when migrating from a legacy v1 version to v2.
Please consult the Traefik migration guide at
https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/migration/v1-to-v2/
for details on how to adapt existing configuration files.
Note that there is a tool that can automate migration and
rewrite existing configuration files (at least partially):
