dhcpcd is a DHCP/IPv4LL/IPv6RS/DHCPv6 client.
It can also act as a network manager, responding to new interfaces,
listening for carrier up/down events and managing routes.

This is an experimental version for testing purposes.
Notably this new development version includes privilege separation;
operations which do not require root are run as the user _dhcp.
