Note that ZeroTier 1.4.6+ has a *new* license prohibiting commercial SaaS
style usage, as well as excluding government organisations. Read the
license details carefully to ensure your compliance.

First start the zerotier service:

service zerotier start

To connect to a zerotier network:

zerotier-cli join <network>

If you are running other daemons or require firewall rules to depend on
zerotier interfaces being available at startup, you may need to enable
the following sysctl in /etc/sysctl.conf:

net.link.tap.up_on_open=1

This avoids a race condition where zerotier interfaces are created, but
not up, prior to firewalls and services trying to use them.

You can place optional configuration in /var/db/zerotier-one/local.conf
as required, see documentation at https://www.zerotier.com/manual.shtml

If your system boots from DHCP (such as a laptop), there is a new rc.conf
flag that will require that system startup will wait until the zerotier
network is established before proceeding. Note that this flag *does not*
work for systems confgured with statically assigned IP addresses, and
these will hang indefinitely due to an irreducible loop in rc(8) startup
files. This flag is disabled by default.
