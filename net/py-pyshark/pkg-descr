pyshark is a Python wrapper for tshark, allowing python packet parsing using
wireshark dissectors.

There are quite a few python packet parsing modules, this one is different
because it doesn't actually parse any packets, it simply uses tshark's
(wireshark command-line utility) ability to export XMLs to use its parsing. This
package allows parsing from a capture file or a live capture, using all
wireshark dissectors you have installed.
