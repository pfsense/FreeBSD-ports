This is an implementation of rsync with a BSD (ISC) license. It's compatible
with a modern rsync (3.1.3 is used for testing, but any supporting protocol 27
will do), but accepts only a subset of rsync's command-line arguments.

Its officially-supported operating system is OpenBSD, but it will compile and
run on other UNIX systems. See Portability for details.
