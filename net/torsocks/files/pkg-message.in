  message: <<EOM
You installed torsocks, which is part of the Tor Project.
If you have non-local or non-standard Tor SOCKS server location,
please edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/tor/torsocks.conf

To run most programs through Tor launch them like this:
	torsocks [any executable]
For example you can use ssh to a some.host.com by doing:
	torsocks ssh username@some.host.com -l <user>
or launch pidgin by doing:
	torsocks pidgin

==SECURITY WARNING==
Please note that torsocks does not in general guarantee that all
network connections made using torsocks will always go through
Tor, and not directly through the unsecured network. There are many
ways how general programs can purposefully or inadvertently defeat
torsocks. One way is to reset the environment variable for the child
process. You can use ex. wireshark to see where network packets are
actually sent by the program in question.
