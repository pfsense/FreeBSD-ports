Fast scalable ip range aggregation and summary tool kit. Find intersections
across multiple lists of IP ranges, fast.

Although similar in functionality to Net::CIDR::Compare, Net::Netmask and
NetAddr::IP, Net::IP::RangeCompare is a completely range driven ip management
and evaluation tool allowing more flexibility and scalability when dealing with
the somewhat organic nature of IP-Ranges.

If you have a large number of ipv4 ranges and need to inventory lists of ranges
for intersections, this is the Module for you!
