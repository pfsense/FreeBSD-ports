Routinator collects Resource Public Key Infrastructure cryptographically
signed statements about the association of Internet routing resources
and constructs a list of associations between IP address prefixes
and AS numbers.  It provides this information to routers supporting
the RPKI-RTR protocol or publishes this in a number of useful
formats.
