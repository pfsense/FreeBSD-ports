This package contains programs for printing basic system
information and for system maintenance.
System-Info displays basic status information about the
system: hostname, uptime, CPU, memory statistics, disk
space statistics, SSH public key hashes, and networking
information. Furthermore, it can be configured to show
one or more banners (for example,  a project name).
System-Info can be configured to be automatically run when
logging in, providing the user an up-to-date overview of
the system.
System-Maintenance runs basic system maintenance tasks:
trying to repair broken package management, updating the
package management databases, installing all available
updates, checking for old kernels and removing them, trim
SSD or unmap unused storage.
