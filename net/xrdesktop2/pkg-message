	xrdesktop_config is now xrdesktop2_config

	If you intend to use previous config settings from 1.x versions, you
	will need to start xrdesktop2, and allow it to create the config file
	for the first time. Then exit xrdesktop2. You must do this BEFORE you
	attempt to migrate settings from your previous config.

	This is only required the first time you use xrdesktop2. This only
	concerns those wanting to migrate their xrdesktop 1.x settings, and
	does not affect first time users of xrdesktop2. This will NOT be
	required in future versions.
