Open vSwitch is a production quality, multilayer virtual switch licensed
under the open source Apache 2.0 license. It is designed to enable massive
network automation through programmatic extension, while still supporting
standard management interfaces and protocols (e.g. NetFlow, sFlow, RSPAN,
ERSPAN, CLI, LACP, 802.1ag). In addition, it is designed to support
distribution across multiple physical servers similar to VMware's vNetwork
distributed vswitch or Cisco's Nexus 1000V.
