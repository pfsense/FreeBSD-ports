Jumpgate is a TCP connection forwarder that provides many enhancements and
improvements over the existing programs that do the same thing.  Only
tested on OpenBSD, but should run without problems on any Unix-like
system.  If you furtherly improve it, please send me the diffs.  As always,
published under a BSD style license, see the included LICENSE file.
