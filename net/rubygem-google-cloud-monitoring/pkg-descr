Ruby Client for the Cloud Monitoring API

Cloud Monitoring collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud,
Amazon Web Services (AWS), hosted uptime probes, and application
instrumentation.

Actual client classes for the various versions of this API are defined in
versioned client gems, with names of the form google-cloud-monitoring-v*. The
gem google-cloud-monitoring is the main client library that brings the verisoned
gems in as dependencies, and provides high-level methods for constructing
clients.
