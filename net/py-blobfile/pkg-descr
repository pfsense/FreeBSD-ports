blobfile is a library that provides a Python-like interface for reading local
and remote files (only from blob storage), with an API similar to open() as well
as some of the os.path and shutil functions. blobfile supports local paths,
Google Cloud Storage paths (gs://<bucket>), and Azure Blob Storage paths
(az://<account>/<container> or
https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/).

The main function is BlobFile, which lets you open local and remote files that
act more or less like local ones. There are also a few additional functions such
as basename, dirname, and join, which mostly do the same thing as their os.path
namesakes, only they also support GCS paths and ABS paths.

This library is inspired by TensorFlow's gfile but does not have exactly the
same interface.
