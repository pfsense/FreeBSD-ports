rpki-client is a FREE, easy-to-use implementation of the Resource Public Key
Infrastructure (RPKI) for Relying Parties (RP) to facilitate validation of the
Route Origin of a BGP announcement. The program queries the RPKI repository
system and outputs Validated ROA Payloads in the configuration format of either
OpenBGPD or BIRD, but also as CSV or JSON objects for consumption by other
routing stacks.

This version is based on the portable version of rpki-client.
