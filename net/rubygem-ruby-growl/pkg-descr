A pure-ruby growl notifier.  ruby-growl allows you to perform Growl
notification via UDP from machines without growl installed (for
example, non-OSX machines).

What's Growl?  Growl is a really cool "global notification system
for Mac OS X".

You can receive Growl notifications on various platforms and send
them from any machine that runs Ruby.

ruby-growl also contains a command-line notification tool named
'growl'.  Where possible, it isoption-compatible with growlnotify.
(Use --priority instead of -p.)
