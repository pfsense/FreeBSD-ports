You need to do some things before you can use the Amazon Simple
Queue Service:

1) Visit http://aws.amazon.com/ to create an Amazon AWS account.

2) Obtain your AWS public key and secret key to use with the SQS service.

3) Use the Amazon AWS calculator to estimate your monthly cost:
   http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/calc5.html?

4) Visit the Amazon SQS Resource Center for information, tutorials and
   sample code:
   http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=8

   DISCLAIMER: No one but you is responsible for paying Amazon to use
               the SQS service. SQS does not have a free sandbox area,
               so be aware how much money you are spending to use the
               service.
