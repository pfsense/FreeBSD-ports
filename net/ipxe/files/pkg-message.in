Should you require overwriting some settings, this port offers you the
_IPXE_BUILDCFG variable that can be set for you to manage extra build
configurations - e.g.: add a custom (self-signed) CA certificate to it.

In the default configuration, iPXE will automatically trust the same
set of certificates as the Firefox web browser. More information about
iPXE's cryptography support: https://ipxe.org/crypto

The following files have been installed in %%DATADIR%%:
- ipxe.dsk for creating a bootable floppy disk

- ipxe.efi-*.usb for creating a bootable EFI USB key
- ipxe.iso for creating a bootable CD
- ipxe.lkrn for any boot manager that can boot Linux kernels

- ipxe.usb for creating a bootable USB key
- undionly.kpxe for chainloading from a PXE ROM; contains only
  the UNDI drivers

  only find and boot the specific NIC device it was chained from
- snp.efi-* same as snponly but tries to boot all devices
