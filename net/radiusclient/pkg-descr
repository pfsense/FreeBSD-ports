The RadiusClient is a framework and library for writing RADIUS Clients which
additionally includes radlogin, a flexible RADIUS aware login replacement,
a command line program to send RADIUS authentication/authorisation requests
and accounting records and a utility to query the status of a RADIUS server.
All these programs are based on a library which lets you develop a
RADIUS-aware application in less than 50 lines of C code.
