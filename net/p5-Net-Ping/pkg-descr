Net::Ping contains methods to test the reachability of remote hosts on a
network. A ping object is first created with optional parameters, a variable
number of hosts may be pinged multiple times and then the connection is closed.

You may choose one of six different protocols to use for the ping. The "tcp"
protocol is the default. Note that a live remote host may still fail to be
pingable by one or more of these protocols. For example, www.microsoft.com is
generally alive but not "icmp" pingable.
