To enable %%NAME%% at startup, add the following line to your 'rc.conf':
%%NAME%%_enable="YES"

Configure %%NAME%% by editing '%%ETCDIR%%/%%NAME%%.conf'.
Example configurations can be found here:
  https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole/tree/main/examples

Run
  service %%NAME%% rcvar
to learn about existing rc script parameters and their defaults.

Note that there are two operating modes for %%NAME%%: server or
client.

Note that the rc script runs %%NAME%% as user 'nobody' by default.
This might lead to permission problems since the user is not
allowed to open ports below 1024.
If you really need %%NAME%% to react on a port below 1024, you
could configure your firewall to redirect traffic to a higher
port (e.g. redirect port 80 to port 8080 where %%NAME%% listens).
