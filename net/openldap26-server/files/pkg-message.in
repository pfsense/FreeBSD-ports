  message: <<EOM
The OpenLDAP server package has been successfully installed.

In order to run the LDAP server, you need to edit
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/openldap/slapd.conf
to suit your needs and add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf:
  slapd_enable="YES"
  slapd_flags='-h "ldapi://%2fvar%2frun%2fopenldap%2fldapi/ ldap://0.0.0.0/"'
  slapd_sockets="/var/run/openldap/ldapi"

Then start the server with
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/slapd start
or reboot.

Try `man slapd' and the online manual at
  http://www.OpenLDAP.org/doc/
for more information.

slapd runs under a non-privileged user id (by default `ldap'),
see %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/slapd for more information.

PLEASE NOTE:

Upgrading from %%PORTNAME%%%%PKGNAMESUFFIX%% 2.4 to 2.5 requires a full dump
and reimport of database.

Starting from %%PORTNAME%%%%PKGNAMESUFFIX%% 2.4.59_3, automatic data dumps
are saved at %%BACKUPDIR%% when shutting down slapd.

Please refer to OpenLDAP Software 2.5 Administrator's Guide at
  https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin25/appendix-upgrading.html
for additional upgrade instructions.
