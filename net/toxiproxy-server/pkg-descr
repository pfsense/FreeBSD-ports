Toxiproxy is a framework for simulating network conditions. It's
made specifically to work in testing, CI and development environments,
supporting deterministic tampering with connections, but with support
for randomized chaos and customization. Toxiproxy is the tool you
need to prove with tests that your application doesn't have single
points of failure.
