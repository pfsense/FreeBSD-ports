Reliable Asynchronous Event Transport protocol

RAET is designed to provide secure reliable scalable asynchronous message/event
transport over the internet in a micro-threaded multi-process application
framework that uses UDP for interhost communication and LibSodium for
authentication, encryption and the CurveCP handshake for secure bootstrap.
