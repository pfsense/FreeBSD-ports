geopy is a Python client for several popular geocoding web services.

geopy makes it easy for Python developers to locate the coordinates of
addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe using third-party
geocoders and other data sources.

geopy includes geocoder classes for the OpenStreetMap Nominatim, Google
Geocoding API (V3), and many other geocoding services. The full list is
available on the Geocoders doc section. Geocoder classes are located in
