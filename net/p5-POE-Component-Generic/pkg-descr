POE::Component::Generic is a POE component that provides a
non-blocking wrapper around any object. It works by forking
a child process with POE::Wheel::Run and creating the object
in the child process. Method calls are then serialised and
sent via STDIN to the child to be handled. Return values are
posted back to your session via STDOUT. This means that all
method arguments and return values must survive serialisation.
If you need to pass coderefs, use "callbacks", "postbacks" or
"factories".

Method calls are wrapped in eval in the child process so that
errors may be propagated back to your session. See "OUTPUT".

Output to STDERR in the child, that is from your object, is
shown only if debug or verbose is set.

STDOUT in the child, that is from your object, is redirected
to STDERR and will be shown in the same circomstances.
