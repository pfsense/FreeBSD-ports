The Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) is a free software
project and a Global community measuring Internet censorship since 2012.

OONI's miniooni is a small command line client useful to test the
functionality without integrating with full features of OONI Probe CLI.

miniooni can use tunnels provided by Tor, if you like to. The use of regular
HTTP proxies is also possible.
