ldap0 provides an object-oriented API to access LDAP directory servers from
Python programs. Mainly it wraps the OpenLDAP 2.x libs for that purpose.

Additionally the package contains Python modules:

  - parsing and producing LDIF
  - handle LDAPURLs
  - parse and handle LDAPv3 subschema
  - LDAPv3 extended operations and controls
  - automatic tests with OpenLDAP server This package is a non-compatible for
    of python-ldap and therefore uses the separate module name-space 'ldap0'.
