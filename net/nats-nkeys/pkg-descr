NATS is an open-source, cloud-native messaging system.

This is a command line utility to manage NATS Ed25519 keys.

The NATS ecosystem will be moving to Ed25519 keys for identity,
authentication and authorization for entities such as Accounts,
Users, Servers and Clusters.

Ed25519 is fast and resistant to side channel attacks. Generation
of a seed key is all that is needed to be stored and kept safe, as
the seed can generate both the public and private keys.

The NATS system will utilize Ed25519 keys, meaning that NATS systems
will never store or even have access to any private keys. Authentication
will utilize a random challenge response mechanism.
