GUPnP is an object-oriented open source framework for creating UPnP devices and
control points, written in C using GObject and libsoup. The GUPnP API is
intended to be easy to use, efficient and flexible.

GUPnP Tools are free replacements of Intel UPnP tools that use GUPnP. They
provides the following client and server side tools which enable one to easily
test and debug one's UPnP devices and control points:
- Universal Control Point: a tool that enables one to discover UPnP devices and
  services, retrieve information about them, subscribe to events and invoke
  actions.
- Network Light: a virtual light bulb that allows control points to switch it on
  and off, change its dimming level and query its current status. It also
  provides a simple UI to control all the network lights available on the
  network.
- AV Control Point: a simple media player UI that enables one to discover and
  play multimedia contents available on a network. It is strictly a control
  point and therefore does not have any playback capabilities of it's own and
  relies on external UPnP MediaRenderer devices for actual playback.
- Upload: a simple commandline utility that uploads files to known MediaServers.
  Use Universal Control Point for discovering the MediaServers.
