Yggdrasil is an early-stage implementation of a fully end-to-end encrypted IPv6
network. It is lightweight, self-arranging, supported on multiple platforms and
allows pretty much any IPv6-capable application to communicate securely with
other Yggdrasil nodes. Yggdrasil does not require you to have IPv6 Internet
connectivity - it also works over IPv4.
