Astron is an open-source, distributed server suite particularly well-suited
for powering MMO games. The design is inspired by a similar unrelated project
developed at the Disney Interactive Media Group, and used in-house from 2001
until 2013.

The suite consists of many components, which handle separate tasks in order
to distribute the workload of managing a multi-sharded game/application
environment with many objects and clients.
