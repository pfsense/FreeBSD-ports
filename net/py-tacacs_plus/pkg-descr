A TACACS+ client that supports authentication, authorization and
accounting.

Unlike RADIUS, which was designed for similar purposes, the TACACS+
protocol offers basic packet encryption but, as with most crypto
designed back then, it's not secure and definitely should not be used
over untrusted networks.

This package has been successfully used with the free tac_plus TACACS+
server on a variety of operating systems.
