ntopng (replaces ntop) is a network probe that shows network usage in a way
similar to what top does for processes. In interactive mode, it displays the
network status on the user's terminal. In Web mode it acts as a Web server,
creating an HTML dump of the network status. It sports a NetFlow/sFlow
emitter/collector, an HTTP-based client interface for creating ntop-centric
monitoring applications, and RRD for persistently storing traffic statistics.
