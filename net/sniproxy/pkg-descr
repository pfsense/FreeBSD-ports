SNIproxy - Proxies incoming HTTP and TLS connections based on the
hostname contained in the initial request of the TCP session. This
enables HTTPS name-based virtual hosting to separate backend servers
without installing the private key on the proxy machine.

Features:

Name-based proxying of HTTPS without decrypting traffic. No keys or
certificates required.

Supports both TLS and HTTP protocols.

Supports IPv4, IPv6 and Unix domain sockets for both back end
servers and listeners.

Supports multiple listening sockets per instance.

Supports HAProxy proxy protocol to propagate original source address
to backend servers.
