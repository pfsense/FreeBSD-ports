Speedtest CLI brings the trusted technology and global server network behind
Speedtest to the command line. Built for software developers, system
administrators and computer enthusiasts alike, Speedtest CLI is the first
official Linux-native Speedtest application backed by Ookla.

With Speedtest CLI, you can easily:
- Measure internet connection performance metrics like download, upload, latency
  and packet loss natively without relying on a web browser
- Test the internet connection of your Linux desktop, a remote server or even
  lower-powered devices such as the Raspberry Pi with the Speedtest Server
  Network
- Set up automated scripts to collect connection performance data, including
  trends over time
- Use Speedtest in your programs by wrapping it in the programming language of
  your choice
- View test results via CSV, JSONL or JSON
