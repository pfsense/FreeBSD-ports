FreeBSD kernel module for Amnezia VPN protocol.

Amnezia VPN is a VPN protocol that is backward compatible with the
WireGuard VPN protocol. It offers protection against detection by Deep
Packet Inspection (DPI) systems. At the same time, it retains the
simplified architecture and high performance.

The Amnezia VPN protocol has issues with detection due to distinctive
packet signatures. Amnezia addresses this problem by employing advanced
obfuscation methods, allowing its traffic to blend seamlessly with
regular internet traffic.

This package provides the FreeBSD kernel module (if_amn.ko)
implementation for Amnezia VPN, enabling kernel-level support for the
protocol.
