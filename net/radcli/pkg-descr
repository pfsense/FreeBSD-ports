The radcli library is a library for writing RADIUS Clients. The library's
approach is to allow writing RADIUS-aware application in less than 50 lines of C
code.

The freeradius-client library was undocumented, had too much legacy code
centered around radlogin, a tool which is of no significance today, was
IPv4-only and had no releases for several years.

This library addresses these shortcomings, adds package management via
pkg-config, adds support for TCP, TLS and DTLS, provides documentation of the
API, and will include any new features for the task. It is provided as a shared
library in case it is useful to other projects as well, and is also made source
compatible with radiusclient-ng and freeradius-client.
