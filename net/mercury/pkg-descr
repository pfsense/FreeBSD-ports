Mercury is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework specifically designed for use
in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems with high-performance fabrics. Its
network implementation is abstracted to make efficient use of native transports
and allow easy porting to a variety of systems (including future systems).
Mercury supports asynchronous transfer of parameters and execution requests, and
has dedicated support for large data arguments that are transferred using Remote
Memory Access (RMA). Its interface is generic and allows any function call to be
serialized. Since code generation is done using the C preprocessor, no external
tool is required.
