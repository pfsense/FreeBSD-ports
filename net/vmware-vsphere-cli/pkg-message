Please note that, by default, an underlying Perl module does certificate
verification when communicating with vSphere hosts.

You must create a file that contains the public keys of all of your
vSphere hosts and then configure your Perl scripts to have the following
line:
$ENV{HTTPS_CA_FILE} = "/path/to/file";

If you want to disable this important security feature, you may set the
following variable to 0:
$ENV{PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME}
EOM
}
