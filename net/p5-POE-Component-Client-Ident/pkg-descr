POE::Component::Client::Ident is a POE component that provides non-
blocking Ident lookup services to other components and sessions.

The component takes requests in the form of events, spawns
POE::Component::Client::Ident::Agent sessions to perform the Ident
queries and returns the appropriate responses to the requesting
session.
