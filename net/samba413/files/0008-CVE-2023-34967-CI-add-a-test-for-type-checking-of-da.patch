Subject: [PATCH 08/21] CVE-2023-34967: CI: add a test for type checking of
 dalloc_value_for_key()

Sends a maliciously crafted packet where the value in a key/value style
dictionary for the "scope" key is a simple string object whereas the server
expects an array. As the server doesn't perform type validation on the value, it
crashes when trying to use the "simple" object as a "complex" one.
