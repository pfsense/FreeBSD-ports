Net::Ping::External is a module which interfaces with the "ping"
command on many systems. It presently provides a single function,
ping(), that takes in a hostname and (optionally) a timeout and
returns true if the host is alive, and false otherwise. Unless you
have the ability (and willingness) to run your scripts as the
superuser on your system, this module will probably provide more
accurate results than Net::Ping will.
