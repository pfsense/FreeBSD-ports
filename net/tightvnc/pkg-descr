Enhanced version of VNC, called TightVNC (grown from the VNC Tight Encoder
project), which is optimized to work over slow network connections such as
low-speed modem links. While original VNC may be very slow when your
connection is not fast enough, with TightVNC you can work remotely almost
in real time in most environments. Besides bandwidth optimizations,TightVNC
also includes many other improvements, optimizations and bugfixes over VNC.
Note that TightVNC is free, cross-platform and compatible with the standard
VNC.
