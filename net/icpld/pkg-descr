ICPLD (Internet Connection Performance Logging Daemon) is a
daemon which, by sending ICMP requests to an IP address of your
choice, monitors whether your machine has a working network
connection. It will log any failed attempts, and will stamp a
log as soon as a reply is received. It keeps track of when the
connection was unavailable, as well as for how long. It records
both total down time and each occasion of interrupted
connection. The log can also be duplicated in HTML format to
put online.
