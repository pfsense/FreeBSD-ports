Stackdriver Trace is a distributed tracing system that collects latency data
from your applications and displays it in the Google Cloud Platform Console. You
can track how requests propagate through your application and receive detailed
near real-time performance insights. Stackdriver Trace automatically analyzes
all of your application's traces to generate in-depth latency reports to surface
performance degradations, and can capture traces from all of your VMs,
containers, or Google App Engine projects.
