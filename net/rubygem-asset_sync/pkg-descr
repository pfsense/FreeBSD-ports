Asset Sync is built to run with the new Rails Asset Pipeline feature introduced
in Rails 3.1. After you run bundle exec rake assets:precompile your assets will
be synchronised to your S3 bucket, optionally deleting unused files and only
uploading the files it needs to.

This was initially built and is intended to work on Heroku but can work on any
platform.
