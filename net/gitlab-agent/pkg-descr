GitLab Kubernetes Agent is an active in-cluster component for solving any
GitLab<->Kubernetes integration tasks.

It's implemented as two communicating pieces - GitLab Kubernetes Agent (agentk)
that is running in the cluster and GitLab Kubernetes Agent Server (gitlab-kas)
that is running on the GitLab side. Please see the architecture document and
other documents in the doc directory for more information.
User-facing documentation is also available.
