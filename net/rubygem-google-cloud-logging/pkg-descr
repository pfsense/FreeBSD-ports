google-cloud-logging is the official library for Stackdriver Logging.

Stackdriver Logging allows you to store, search, analyze, monitor, and alert on
log data and events from Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services (AWS). It
supports ingestion of any custom log data from any source. Stackdriver Logging
is a fully-managed service that performs at scale and can ingest application and
system log data from thousands of VMs. Even better, you can analyze all that log
data in real-time.
