wmnetload is a network interface monitor dockapp for Window Maker.  It is
designed to fit well with dockapps like wmcpuload and wmmemmon.  It tracks
whether the interface is functioning and displays current network interface
throughput, along with an auto-scaling graph of recent network activity
(the graph separates upstream and downstream traffic load cleanly without
resorting to colors).
