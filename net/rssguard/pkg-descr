RSS Guard is simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use RSS/Atom feed aggregator
developed using Qt framework which supports online feed synchronization
with various services, e.g. Bazqux, Feedly, FreshRSS, Gmail, Google Reader,
Inoreader, Nextcloud News, Reedah, Tiny Tiny RSS.

In contrast with many other RSS readers, heavy WebKit/WebEngine dependency
is optional for RSS Guard: when built without it, simple text component is
used and some features will be disabled.
