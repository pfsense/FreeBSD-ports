Remmina is a remote desktop client written in GTK+, aiming to be useful for
system administrators and travellers, who need to work with lots of remote
computers in front of either large monitors or tiny netbooks. Remmina supports
multiple network protocols in an integrated and consistant user interface.

Remmina includes support for the following network protocols:
* RDP, VNC, SPICE, NX, XDMCP, SSH, SFTP

This is the lite flavor of the Remmina package, compiled with the minimum
dependencies to support the RDP and VNC protocols only.
