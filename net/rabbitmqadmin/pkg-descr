rabbitmqadmin is a command-line tool for managing RabbitMQ via its HTTP API.
It allows administrators to declare, list, and delete RabbitMQ objects such as
queues, exchanges, bindings, users, virtual hosts, and more.

This is version 2 of rabbitmqadmin, a complete rewrite of the original Python
tool. It provides a modern CLI interface with improved validation, better error
handling, and is distributed as a standalone binary rather than as part of the
RabbitMQ management plugin.

Key features include:
- Managing virtual hosts, queues, exchanges, bindings, and users
- Purging queues and publishing/retrieving messages
- Working with policies, shovels, and federation
- Exporting and importing definitions
- Health checks and monitoring
- Support for TOML-based configuration files
