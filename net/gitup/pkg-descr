A minimalist, dependency-free FreeBSD program to clone/pull git
repositories. Intended for non-developers, gitup synchronizes local
copies of repositories without the additional overhead that the
official git client requires. Because gitup neither uses nor updates
the contents of .git directories, the official git client should not
be used on repositories cloned or modified with gitup.
