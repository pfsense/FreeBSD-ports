liboping is a C library to generate ICMP echo requests, better known as
'ping packets'. It is intended for use in network monitoring applications
or applications that would otherwise need to fork ping(1) frequently.
Included is a sample application, called oping, which demonstrates the
library's abilities. It is like ping, ping6, and fping rolled into one.

Version 1.4.0, a second example application, noping, provides an
ncurses-based front-end to liboping. Using curses windows it is able
to display the ping statistics online 'live'. An aberrant behavior
detection highlights all round-trip times that are unusually high or
low.
