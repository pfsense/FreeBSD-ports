This is a package to facilitate the movement of CARP Virtual IPs in an
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) deployment. OCI utilises off-box network
virtualisation and needs to be notified of VIP movement so that the
network virtualisation layer can be updated. This package allows for the
configuration of calls to OCI to facilitate this movement.
