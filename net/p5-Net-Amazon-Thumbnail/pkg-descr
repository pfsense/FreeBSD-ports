The Alexa Site Thumbnail web service provides developers with
programmatic access to thumbnail images for the home pages of web
sites. It offers access to Alexa's large and growing collection of
images, gathered from its comprehensive web crawl. This web service
enables developers to enhance web sites, search results, web
directories, blog entries, and other web real estate with Alexa
thumbnail images.
