Google Cloud Pub / Sub is a fully-managed real-time messaging service
that allows you to send and receive messages between independent
applications. You can leverage Cloud Pub/Sub's flexibility to decouple
systems and components hosted on Google Cloud Platform or elsewhere on
the Internet. By building on the same technology Google uses, Cloud Pub
/ Sub is designed to provide "at least once" delivery at low latency
with on-demand scalability to 1 million messages per second (and
beyond).
