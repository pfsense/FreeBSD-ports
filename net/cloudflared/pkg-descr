cloudflared is the command-line client for Argo Tunnel, a tunneling daemon
that proxies any local webserver through the cloudflare network.

Argo Tunnel exposes applications running on your local web server, on any
network with an Internet connection, without adding DNS records or configuring
a firewall or router. It just works.
