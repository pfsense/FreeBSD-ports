Pyroute2 is a pure Python netlink library. It requires only Python stdlib, no
3rd party libraries. The library was started as an RTNL protocol implementation,
so the name is pyroute2, but now it supports many netlink protocols. Some
supported netlink families and protocols:
- rtnl, network settings --- addresses, routes, traffic controls
- nfnetlink --- netfilter API: ipset, nftables, ...
- ipq --- simplest userspace packet filtering, iptables QUEUE target
- devlink --- manage and monitor devlink-enabled hardware
- generic --- generic netlink families
  - nl80211 --- wireless functions API (basic support)
  - taskstats --- extended process statistics
  - acpi_events --- ACPI events monitoring
  - thermal_events --- thermal events monitoring
  - VFS_DQUOT --- disk quota events monitoring

Starting with 0.5.2 the library supports also PF_ROUTE sockets on BSD systems.
