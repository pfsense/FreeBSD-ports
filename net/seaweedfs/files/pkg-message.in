  message: <<EOM
SeaweedFS presents a simple interface behind a complex distributed system.

For a single node "demo setup" you can just run:

$ mkdir /tmp/weeds
$ %%PREFIX%%/bin/weed -logtostderr server -dir /tmp/weeds -s3

For a more typical setup, you should have either 1 or 3 masters, and
multiple filers, with replication enabled.

Adjust %%PREFIX%%/etc/seaweedfs/*.toml according to your requirements,
using the sample configs in the same directory. Most parameters can be
ignored, refer to the seaweedfs wiki for further explanations.

Please read the documentation carefully, particularly around data
replication, and running redundant masters. Prime numbers of servers are
your friend, choose them wisely.

{ type: upgrade
  maximum_version: "3.26"
  message: <<EOM
When upgrading from before 3.26 these variables, if used, should be replaced:
* seaweedfs_syslog_output_enable replaces seaweedfs_syslog_enable
  (seaweedfs_syslog_enable, seaweedfs_syslog_output_priority
  and seaweedfs_syslog_output_facility still work),
* seaweedfs_syslog_output_priority replaces seaweedfs_syslog_priority
  (seaweedfs_syslog_priority still works only when seaweedfs_syslog_enable
  is set),
* seaweedfs_syslog_output_facility replaces seaweedfs_syslog_facility
  (seaweedfs_syslog_facility still works only when seaweedfs_syslog_enable
  is set).

Also default directory to store data files ("${seaweedfs_dir}/data"), if need,
should be moved to "${seaweedfs_dir}" (ex, %%SEAWEEDFS_DIR%%/data
to %%SEAWEEDFS_DIR%%).

And weed executable has been moved from %%PREFIX%%/sbin to %%PREFIX%%/bin.
