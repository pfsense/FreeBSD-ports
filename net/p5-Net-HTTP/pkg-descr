The Net::HTTP class is a low-level HTTP client. An instance of the Net::HTTP
class represents a connection to an HTTP server. The HTTP protocol is described
in RFC 2616. The Net::HTTP class supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.

Net::HTTP is a sub-class of one of IO::Socket::IP (IPv6+IPv4), IO::Socket::INET6
(IPv6+IPv4), or IO::Socket::INET (IPv4 only). You can mix the methods described
below with reading and writing from the socket directly. This is not necessary a
good idea, unless you know what you are doing.
