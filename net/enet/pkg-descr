ENet's purpose is to provide a relatively thin, simple and robust network
communication layer on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol). The primary feature
it provides is optional reliable, in-order delivery of packets.

ENet is NOT intended to be a general purpose high level networking library that
handles authentication, lobbying, server discovery, compression, encryption and
other high level, often application level or dependent tasks.
