  message: <<EOM
The OpenLDAP server package has been successfully installed.

In order to run the LDAP server, you need to edit
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/openldap/slapd.conf
to suit your needs and add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf:
  slapd_enable="YES"
  slapd_flags='-h "ldapi://%2fvar%2frun%2fopenldap%2fldapi/ ldap://0.0.0.0/"'
  slapd_sockets="/var/run/openldap/ldapi"

Then start the server with
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/slapd start
or reboot.

Try `man slapd' and the online manual at
  http://www.OpenLDAP.org/doc/
for more information.

slapd runs under a non-privileged user id (by default `ldap'),
see %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/slapd for more information.

PLEASE NOTE:

As of %%PORTNAME%%%%PKGNAMESUFFIX%% 2.4.58_2, the server is now modularized and
all overlays are built as dynamic modules instead of being statically linked.
Previously, statically linked modules do not need an explicit
moduleload (in slapd.conf(5)) or olcModuleLoad (when using slapd-config(5))
and you might need to make configuration change accordingly as part of the
upgrade.
