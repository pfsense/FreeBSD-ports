OurNet::BBSAgent provides an object-oriented interface to TCP/IP based
interactive services, by simulating as a virtual user with action defined by a
script language.

The developer could then use the same methods to access different services, to
easily implement interactive robots, spiders, or other cross-service agents.

The scripting language of OurNet::BBSAgent features both flow-control and
event-driven capabilities, makes it especially well-suited for dealing with
automation tasks involved with Telnet-based BBS systems.

This module is the foundation of the BBSAgent back-end described in OurNet::BBS.
Please consult its man page for more information.
