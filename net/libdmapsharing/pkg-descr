Libdmapsharing is a library you may use to access, share and control the
playback of media content using DMAP (DAAP, DPAP & DACP). Libdmapsharing
also detects audio AirPlay services; coupled with the AirPlay support
in PulseAudio or GStreamer, this can allow an application to stream audio
to an AirPlay device. The library presently supports Linux and other
POSIX-based systems.
