This is a client for the OpenStack Cinder API. There's a Python API (the
cinderclient module), and a command-line script (cinder). Each implements 100%
of the OpenStack Cinder API.

See the OpenStack CLI Reference for information on how to use the cinder
command-line tool. You may also want to look at the OpenStack API documentation.
