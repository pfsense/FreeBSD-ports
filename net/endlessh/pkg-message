Configure endlessh either via endlessh.conf or using endlessh_args in rc.conf.
The defaults are commented out in endlessh.conf.

The default configuration only logs starts & stops to /var/log/endlessh.log.
To see the connections set LogLevel 1 in endlessh.conf or add "-v" to
endlessh_args. Sending SIGUSR1 to endlessh (pkill USR1 endlessh) will add
statistics to the /var/log/endlessh.log file

Neither endlessh nor daemon support rotating the logfile, use periodic or
cron to copy the logfile and truncate it using

   $ echo -n > /var/log/endlessh.log
