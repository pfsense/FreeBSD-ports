Net::HTTPS::NB provides same interface as Net::HTTPS but it will never try
multiple reads when the read_response_headers() or read_entity_body() methods
are invoked. In addition allows non-blocking connect.

If read_response_headers() did not see enough data to complete the headers an
empty list is returned.

If read_entity_body() did not see new entity data in its read the value -1 is
returned.
