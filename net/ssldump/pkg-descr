ssldump is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyzer.  It identifies TCP
connections on the chosen network interface and attempts to interpret
them as SSLv3/TLS traffic.  When it identifies SSLv3/TLS traffic, it
decodes the records and displays them in a textual form to stdout.  If
provided with the appropriate keying material, it will also decrypt
the connections and display the application data traffic.
