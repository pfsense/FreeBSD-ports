This module provides an interface to deal with Media Access Control (or MAC)
addresses. These are the addresses that uniquely identify a device on various
layer 2 networks. Although the most common case is hardware addresses
on Ethernet network cards, there are a variety of devices that use this
system of addressing.

This module supports both EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses and implements an OO
and a functional interface.
