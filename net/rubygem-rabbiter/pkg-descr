Rabbiter is a tool that collects tweets related to the talk and
sends them to Rabbit as comments.

In public conference such as RubyKaigi, audiences tweet comments
about the listening talk to Twitter. To show the comments to your
slide showed by Rabbit, you can use Rabbiter.

If you have room to breathe, you can reply to the comments to reflect
audiences' opinions. An audience can listen your talk with some
different points of view because an audience can know other's
comments. Note that you have a risk that audiences are interested
in audiences' comments rather than your talk. You should ready your
talk to make very interesting talk rather than audiences' comments.
