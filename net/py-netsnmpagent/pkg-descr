Python module that facilitates writing Net-SNMP subagents in Python.

Subagents connect to a locally running Master agent (snmpd) over a Unix domain
socket and using the AgentX protocol (RFC2741).
They implement custom Management Information Base (MIB) modules that extend
the local node MIB tree. Usually, this requires writing a MIB as well, ie.
a text file that specifies the structure, names and data types of the
information within the MIB module.
