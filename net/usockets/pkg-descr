uSockets is the cross-platform async networking and eventing foundation library.

Features:
* Built-in (optionally available) TLS support exposed with identical interface
  as for TCP.
* Acknowledges and integrates with any event-loop via a layered hierarchical
  design of plugins.
* Extremely pedantic about user space memory footprint and designed to perform
  as good as can be.
* Designed from scratch to map well to user space TCP stacks or other
  experimental platforms.
* Low resolution timer system ideal for performant tracking of networking
  timeouts.
* Minimal yet truly cross-platform, will not emit a billion different platform
  specific error codes.
* Fully opaque library, inclusion will not completely pollute your global
  namespace.
