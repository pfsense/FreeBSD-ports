Ziina lets you invite peers into a local Zellij session over untrusted
networks, despite you being behind a NAT gateway. It is heavily
inspired by tmate.

Ziina is (basically) server-less. You only need a standard OpenSSH
server with a public IP that serves as an entry-point for your peers.
Your peers only need a standard OpenSSH client.
