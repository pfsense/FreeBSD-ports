A permissively licensed, async/await-native I/O library for Python. Its main
purpose is to help you write programs that do multiple things at the same time
with parallelized I/O. A web spider that wants to fetch lots of pages in
parallel, a web server that needs to juggle lots of downloads and websocket
connections at the same time, a process supervisor monitoring multiple
subprocesses. Compared to other libraries, Trio attempts to distinguish itself
with an obsessive focus on usability and correctness. Concurrency is
complicated; trio tries to make it easy to get things right.

Trio was built from the ground up to take advantage of the latest Python
features, and draws inspiration from many sources, in particular Dave Beazley's
Curio. The resulting design is radically simpler than older competitors like
asyncio and Twisted, yet just as capable.
