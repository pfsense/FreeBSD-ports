Paraller::Pvm is a perl interface to the Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM)
Message Passing System.

The PVM message passing system enables a programmer to configure a group
of (possibly heterogenous) computers connected by a network into a
parallel virtual machine.

Using PVM, applications can be developed which spawns parallel processes
onto nodes in the virtual machine to perform specific tasks.  These
parallel tasks can also periodically exchange information using a set of
message passing functions developed for the system.

PVM applications have mostly been developed in the scientific and
engineering fields.  However applications for real-time and
client/server systems can also be developed.  PVM simply provides a
convenient way for managing parallel tasks and communications without
need for rexec or socket level programming.
