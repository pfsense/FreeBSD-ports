OpenBGPD is a FREE implementation of the Border Gateway Protocol, Version 4.
It allows ordinary machines to be used as routers exchanging routes with
other systems speaking the BGP protocol.

This is the portable version and it does not have the means to
influence kernel routing tables. It is only suitable for route
servers/collectors.
