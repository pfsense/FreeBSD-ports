gutenfetch can be run once to pick out local Project Gutenberg
servers with the following command line.

# gutenfetch -m

If you are an administrator please copy the generated
file ~/.gutenfetchrc to %%PREFIX%%/etc/gutenfetchrc.  This will
prevent other users from having to pick out their favorite
servers.

gutenfetch also performs best with a caching proxy server such
as wwwoffle or squid.  Although, this version will cache fetched
books in the ~/.libgutenfetch/ directory by default.
