Ng is a very light weight Emacs clone editor, written in C. It doesn't
have Lisp(that means very limited customization is available). Since you
can invoke it very quickly (compared with real GNU Emacs), it is useful
in dealing with changing small file a bit.

Ng(Nihongo Micro Gnu Emacs) is a Mg(Micro Gnu Emacs)'s japanese port.
Ng supports EUC, JIS and SJIS code. Ng also have (rather simple) C-mode.

It is also very useful even if you don't need Japanese support.
