This is a Perl extension module to use NKF (Network Kanji Filter).
It converts the kanji code given as input (which encoding is
automatically recognized) to designated kanji code such as ISO-2022-JP,
Shift_JIS, EUC-JP, UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32.

The syntax is as follows:

	use NKF;
	$output = nkf (@flags, $input)
