XJDIC V2.3, XJDSERVER V2.3 -- (Copyright: J.W. Breen - 1998)

XJDIC is an electronic Japanese-English dictionary program designed to
operate in the X11 window environment. In particular, it must run in an
"xterm" environment which has Japanese language support such as provided
by "kterm" or internationalized xterm, aixterm, etc.

It is based on JDIC and JREADER which were developed to run under MS-DOS
on IBM PCs or clones.

XJDIC functions as:

(a) an English to Japanese dictionary (eiwa jiten), searching for and
displaying entries for key-words entered in English;

(b) a Japanese to English dictionary (waei jiten), searching for and
displaying entries for keywords or phrases entered in Japanese (kanji,
hiragana or katakana);

(c) a Japanese-English Character dictionary (kanei jiten), capable of
selecting kanji characters by JIS code, radical, stroke count, Nelson
Index number or reading, and displaying compounds containing that kanji.
