Ng is a very light weight Emacs clone editor, written in C.  It doesn't
have Lisp, so only limited customization is possible. Since you can invoke
it very quickly (compared with real GNU Emacs), it is particularly useful
for editing files that only require small changes.

Ng(Nihongo Micro Gnu Emacs) is a Mg (Micro Gnu Emacs)'s japanese port.
Ng supports EUC, JIS and SJIS code. Ng also have (rather simple) C-mode.
It is also very useful even if you don't need Japanese support.
