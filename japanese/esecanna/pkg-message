Quick Setup:
  Take the following steps all as root.
    1) Install one of the esecanna-module ports.
    2) Edit `${PREFIX}/etc/esecannarc'.
    3) Stop and disable cannaserver if you have it running.
    4) Run `${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/esecanna.sh start'.
    5) Add `esecanna_enable=YES' to /etc/rc.conf so that
       esecanna automatically starts on (every) boot.

User can copy `${PREFIX}/etc/esecannarc' to `~/.esecannarc'
and customize it to his/her needs.  If esecanna does not
work as excepted, please consult the documents under
${PREFIX}/share/doc/esecanna/ and log output kept in
`/var/log/esecanna.log'.

Note:
  Using VJE-Delta 3.0 trial, esecannaserver will fail to
connect to vjed until after once you run vje.
