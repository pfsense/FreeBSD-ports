Esecanna pretends to be a cannaserver and listens to canna clients.
It interprets to one of the VJE 3.0/2.5 or Wnn6 servers what they say,
then passes through to them what it results.

You'll have to install one of the esecanna modules to run it.

With this, you can use VJE 3.0/2.5 or Wnn6's smart input engine
also from the console applications.

	[   canna clients  ] (mule, jvim, etc.)
	      ||    /\
	      \/    ||
	[     esecanna     ] (esecannaserver + {vje30,wnn6} module)
	      ||    /\
	      \/    ||
	[   input engine   ] (vjed or jserver)
