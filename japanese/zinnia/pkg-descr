Zinnia is a simple, customizable and portable online hand recognition system
based on Support Vector Machines. Zinnia simply receives user pen strokes as a
sequence of coordinate data and outputs n-best characters sorted by SVM
confidence. To keep portability, Zinnia doesn't have any rendering
functionality. In addition to recognition, Zinnia provides training module that
allows us to create any hand-written recognition systems with low-cost.
