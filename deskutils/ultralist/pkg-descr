Ultralist is a task management system for technical people.

It includes a command-line component that is very fast and stays out
of the way. There is also a beautiful webapp that seamlessly syncs
with the command-line.

Ultralist is based off of the Getting Things Done system. It has a
concept of due dates, projects, and contexts.
