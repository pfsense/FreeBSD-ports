	Freemind is an incredible thought organization tool

	FROM THE AUTHORS:
FreeMind is a premier free mind-mapping software written in Java. The recent
development has hopefully turned it into high productivity tool. We are proud
that the operation and navigation of FreeMind is faster than that of Mind
Manager because of one-click "fold / unfold" and "follow link" operations.

So you want to write a completely new metaphysics? Why don't you use FreeMind?
You have a tool at hand that remarkably resembles the tray slips of Robert
Pirsig, described in his sequel to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance
called Lila. Do you want to refactor your essays in a similar way you would
refactor software? Or do you want to keep personal knowledge base, which is
easy to manage? Why don't you try FreeMind?

	FROM THE PORTER (me):
Freemind is usable for many different things. I'm using it to plan
projects, document servers and systems, plan and do html presentations
guides, record and mantain progress of tasks and many other things.
