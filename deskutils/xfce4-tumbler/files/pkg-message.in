To override the default configuration, you must copy the rc-file:

	mkdir ~/.config/tumbler
	cp %%PREFIX%%/etc/xdg/tumbler/tumbler.rc ~/.config/tumbler

The COVER plugin requires manual configuration.

Tumbler supports external plugins to be able to generate thumbnails for
more file formats.

Plugins are configured through ".thumbnailer" files in
%%LOCALBASE%%/share/thumbnailers or (for users) ~/.local/share/thumbnailers.

Ports for libraries and programs sometimes provide such configuration
files and binaries to support thumbnails for their formats (for example
graphics/libheif).
