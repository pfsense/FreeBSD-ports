Cairo-Dock-Plug-ins for Cairo-Dock is a light and eye-candy dock to launch your
programs easily. It uses Cairo / OpenGL to render nice graphics (many in
correlation with Compiz) with hardware acceleration. It's fully configurable
and customizable and can be a taskbar too. You can easily plug applets into it
or in a desklet mode.
