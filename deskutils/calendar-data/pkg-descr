Calendar files extracted from FreeBSD SVN rev. 366901

The purpose of this port is to decouple the calendars from the calendar
program sources, to allow updates outside of the release cycle, and to
make their installation optional.

Files installed by this port will take precedence over similarily named
calendars in the base system.
