cfiles is a terminal file manager with vim like keybindings, written in C using
the ncurses library. It aims to provide an interface like ranger while being
lightweight, fast and minimal.

Due to a missing libexec/w3m/w3mimgdisplay, not installed by www/w3m by default,
the image display feature is broken.
