This is a port of Taskjuggler, a project management tool for Linux and UNIX
system-based operating systems. Instead of clicking yourself painfully through
hundreds of dialog boxes you specify your Taskjuggler project in a simple text
format. You simply list all your tasks and their dependencies. The information
is sent through Taskjuggler and you will get all sorts of reports in HTML or
XML format.
