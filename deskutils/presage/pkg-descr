Presage is an intelligent predictive text entry system.

Presage (formerly known as Soothsayer) generates predictions by modelling
natural language as a combination of redundant information sources. Presage
computes probabilities for words which are most likely to be entered next by
merging predictions generated by the different predictive algorithms. Presageâ€™s
modular and extensible architecture allows its language model to be extended
and customized to utilize statistical, syntactic, and semantic predictive
algorithms.
