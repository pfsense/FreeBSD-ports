Affiche is a little application that allows people to "stick"
little notes on their computer desktop. It works well under
GNUstep and under Apple Mac OS X.

The goal of this little application is to provide a good example
on how to develop cross-platform applications between GNUstep
and Apple Mac OS X while providing a useful application at the
same time.
