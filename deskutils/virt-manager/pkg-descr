The "Virtual Machine Manager" application (virt-manager for short package name)
is a desktop user interface for managing virtual machines. It presents a summary
view of running domains, their live performance & resource utilization
statistics. The detailed view graphs performance & utilization over time.
Wizards enable the creation of new domains, and configuration & adjustment of a
domain's resource allocation & virtual hardware. An embedded VNC client viewer
presents a full graphical console to the guest domain.
