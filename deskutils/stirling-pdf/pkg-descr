Stirling-PDF is a robust, locally hosted web-based PDF manipulation tool.
It enables you to carry out various operations on PDF files, including
splitting, merging, converting, reorganizing, adding images, rotating,
compressing, and more. This locally hosted web application has evolved to
encompass a comprehensive set of features, addressing all your PDF requirements.

All files and PDFs exist either exclusively on the client side, reside in
server memory only during task execution, or temporarily reside in a file
solely for the execution of the task. Any file downloaded by the user will have
been deleted from the server by that point.
