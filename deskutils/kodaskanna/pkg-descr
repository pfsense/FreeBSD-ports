Kodaskanna is a utility for reading data from 1D/2D codes (e.g. QR
codes or bar codes) and making the data available for further processing.

This initial 0.1.0 release supports scanning codes in static images. The image
input files (can be also non-local ones) can be either passed as argument on
the command line or manually selected via a file picker, pasted from the
clipboard or dropped by DnD. The extracted content can then be exported to the
clipboard or as a file. The version also provides integration via the Dolphin
context menu for image files and by a KDE Purpose "Export" plugin.
