Jot is a feature-stripped version of Obsidian focused on rapid note management
through the terminal.
It uses the same format of storage as Obsidian, i.e. markdown files for notes,
and local folders for vaults (and sub-folders).
Commands that encompass all basic needs are included. Each command has an alias
(two letter abbreviation) to further increase rapidity.
