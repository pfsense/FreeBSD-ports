Peaclock is a responsive and customizable clock, timer, and stopwatch for the
terminal.

The clock output changes depending on the selected mode and view. The mode
determines the clock value, while the view determines how that value is
presented. The clock, timer, and stopwatch modes can be displayed with an ascii,
digital, or binary clock view. The clock can be customized, such as changing the
width, height, colour, padding, and margin. When in auto size mode, the clock
becomes responsive, filling up the full size of the terminal. The clock can also
be set to conform to a specific aspect ratio, allowing the clock to auto resize
without becoming stretched.
