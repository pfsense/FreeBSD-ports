The goal of Semantik is to help to structure ideas and concepts by
associating them into a tree. The tree is there to help to see how the
ideas interact, and then to develop them further (add ramifications).

An idea is represented by a shape which can be a text or a picture.
The ideas can be connected, but there is a constraint: an idea cannot
have more than one parent.

A Semantik mind map can be exported as a picture, or used to generate
documents. Templates include pdflatex (article, book) and HTML file
formats.
