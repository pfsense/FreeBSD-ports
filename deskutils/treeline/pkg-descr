TreeLine helps you organise all your sticky notes, lists of books, movies,
website logins, personal contacts, or things to do.

It stores almost any kind of information. A tree structure makes it easy to
keep things organised. Each node in the tree can contain several fields,
forming a mini-database. The output format for each node can be defined, and
the output can be shown on the screen, printed, or exported to html.
