+.SH "DESCRIPTION"
+.PP
+This manual page documents briefly the
+.B autocutsel
+command.
+.PP
+This manual page was written for the
+.B Debian
+distribution because the original
+program does not have a manual page.
+.PP
+.B autocutsel
+tracks changes in the server's
+cutbuffer and clipboard selection.
+When the clipboard is changed,
+it updates the cutbuffer.
+When the cutbuffer is changed,
+it owns the clipboard selection.
+The cutbuffer and clipboard
+selection are always synchronized.
+Since the VNC client synchronizes
+the Windows' clipboard and the
+server's cutbuffer,
+all three "clipboards" are
+always kept synchronized.
+When you copy some text in Windows,
+the cutbuffer and the clipboard
+selection are updated.
+When you copy text on the server
+using either the cutbuffer or
+the clipboard selection,
+the Windows's clipboard is always
+updated.
+
