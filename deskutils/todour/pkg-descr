Todour is an application for handling todo.txt files (as made famous by
Gina Trapani of Lifehacker) on Windows, macOS, and Unix-like operating
systems.  The format is especially practical for an approach similar to
the one suggested in the book ``Getting Things Done'' by David Allen,
often referred to as GTD.
