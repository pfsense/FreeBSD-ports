  message: <<EOM
After each upgrade, please check for differences between your config and
the sample configuration installed by the package:

    diff -u %%PREFIX%%/etc/paperless.conf \
           %%PREFIX%%/etc/paperless.conf.sample

Then merge in changes as required by editing
%%PREFIX%%/etc/paperless.conf.

Database migrations are run automatically on service start, but
it's recommended to run them explicitly, especially on major upgrades:

    service paperless-migrate onestart

  message: <<EOM
WARNING

In versions 2.16.0 - 2.16.3, the interpretation of offset days for
scheduled workflows was inverted. This has  been corrected to restore
the intuitive, pre-2.16 behavior:

    Positive offsets now trigger workflows after the date
    Negative offsets trigger workflows before the date

If you configured scheduled workflows in v2.16.x with inverted offsets
(or adjusted a trigger created in 2.15.x), you must now adjust the
offset sign to match this corrected logic.

If you did not alter your workflow triggers after upgrading from v2.15,
no changes are required.
