This port does not start artbtt-capture automatically, you need to
setup your desktop enviroment to run arbtt-capture on start.

On supported WMs such as GNOME, KDE you can do that by
cp %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/arbtt-capture.desktop ~/.config/autostart/

Also, you would need to have a categorize file at
~/.arbtt/categorize.cfg to run arbtt-stats. A sample file is installed
at %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/categorize.cfg
