Dstask is a personal task tracker designed to help you focus. It is
similar to taskwarrior but uses git to synchronise instead of a
proprietary protocol.

Dstask is mature enough for daily use.

Features:
 o Powerful context system (automatically applies filter/tags to
    queries and new tasks)
 o Git powered sync/undo/resolve (passwordstore.org style) which means
   no need to set up a sync server, and sync between devices is easy!
 o Task listing won't break with long task text (unlike taskwarrior,
   currently)
 o note command -- edit a full markdown note for each task. Checklists
   are useful here.
 o open command -- open URLs found in specified task (including notes)
   in the browser
 o zsh/bash completion for speed
 o A single statically-linked binary
