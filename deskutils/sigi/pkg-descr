sigi is an organizing tool for terminal lovers who hate organizing.  Use
sigi as extra memory.  Use it to toss your tasks, groceries, or the next
board games you want to play onto a stack.  Shell aliases are encouraged
to organize your various stacks.  It's recommended to read the website's
README to understand the intended shell-alias-based invocation style.
