Xwrits reminds you to take wrist breaks for prevention or management of
repetitive stress injuries. When you should take a break, it pops up an
X window, the warning window. You click on the warning  window, then
take a break. The window changes appearance while you take the break.
it changes again when your break is over. Then you just resume typing.
Xwrits hides itself until you should take another break.

The typetime option changes the amount of time between breaks, and the
breaktime option changes the length of a break. The defaults are 55
minutes and 5 minutes, respectively.
