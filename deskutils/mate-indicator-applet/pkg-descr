The indicator applet exposes Ayatana Indicators in the MATE Panel. Ayatana 
Indicators are an initiative by Canonical to provide crisp and clean system 
and application status indication. They take the form of an icon and 
associated menu, displayed (usually) in the desktop panel. Existing indicators
include the Message Menu, Battery Menu and Sound menu.
