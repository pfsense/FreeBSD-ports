This software was developed by the original author, Sanjay Ghemawat
from 1993-1997.  His last version was v2.2.  As system developments
warranted it, other folks published patches and maintenance releases
in order to keep Ical working.  Versions v2.3.1 and 2.3.2 are such
releases.  In 2008, renewed interest in Ical led to new features
such as timezone support, link support, key bindings and per-calendar
colors.  This is the v3.0.x series of releases.
