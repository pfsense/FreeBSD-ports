You installed goesimage, the program that downloads images from the
NOAA Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite and makes them
your wallpaper.

It only makes sense to install goesimage if you are running some
graphical desktop environment.

You need to enable goesimage by running this command:
$ goesimage-enable

This will install the crontab procedure for your current user.

Images will be saved in your ~/.cache/goesimage/ directory, and will
be set as a wallpaper on the Xorg server running on DISPLAY=:0

Before uninstalling, you need to disable it:
$ goesimage-disable

You can also download and update the wallpaper any time:
$ goesimage-run-now
