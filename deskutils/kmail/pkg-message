  message: <<EOM
KDE Applications versions of Akonadi, KMail, and Kontact use large
messages on the local machine. The default size on FreeBSD is too
small, which causes local connection problems, and Akonadi-based
applications will be flaky (e.g. mailboxes do not display, messages
cannot be found). Increasing the buffer size is recommended:

	sysctl net.local.stream.recvspace=65536
	sysctl net.local.stream.sendspace=65536
