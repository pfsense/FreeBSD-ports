This program will attempt to obtain some system information by accessing files
in procfs and linprocfs. You must mount procfs and linprocfs filesystem for this
to work correctly.
This can be accomplished by adding the following line to your /etc/fstab file:

# Device                Mountpoint              FStype        Options Dump Pass
proc                    /proc                  procfs         rw      0    0
linprocfs               /compat/linux/proc      linprocfs     rw      0    0

and then, as root, executing the command:

mount /proc

kldload linprocfs
mount /compat/linux/proc
EOM
}
