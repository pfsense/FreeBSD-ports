To talk to USB and MTP devices the user needs to be able to access
the device node in /dev.

to be aware of USB devices attached to the machine, the user needs
to be a member of the operator group:

# pw groupmod operator -m yourusername

Then, add the following to /etc/devfs.rules, or create this file
if it does not exist yet:

[system=10]
add path 'usb/*' mode 0660 group operator

To load these new rules, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

devfs_system_ruleset="system"

Then, restart devfs

# service devfs restart

If you are using an Android device as your e-book reader, please note
that the stock Google Books app uses a storage format that is not
supported by calibre.  The calibre FAQ recommends that either of the
free apps Aldiko or WordPlayer are used instead.
