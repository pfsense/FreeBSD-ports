xorgxrdp supports hardware acceleration as well as usual xorg-server.
To configure hardware acceleration, follow the following steps.

1. Install drm-kmod
    # pkg install drm-kmod

2. Configure to load kernel module (either one of the following)
    # sysrc kld_list="/boot/modules/i915kms.ko"
    # sysrc kld_list="/boot/modules/amdgpu.ko"
    # sysrc kld_list="/boot/modules/radeonkms.ko"

3. Ensure users who login via xrdp are members of the "video" group
    # pw groupmod video -m username|| pw groupmod wheel -m username

4. Edit /etc/X11/xrdp/xorg.conf to fit your environment
   "/dev/dri/renderD128" might be different depending on your environment.

   Find the following line and change it to the actual path.
    Option "DRMDevice" "/dev/dri/renderD128"

   Change "0" to "1" of the following line.
    Option "DRI3" "0"

5. Restart your system and login via xrdp

If hardware acceleration is properly configured, you will see logs like both
of the following in ~/.local/share/xorg/Xorg.10.log. 10 can be replaced with
display number.

    "glamor X acceleration enabled on Mesa DRI Intel(R) Ivybridge Desktop"
    "rdpScreenInit: rdpDri3Init ok"
