bio-old-biofetch-emulator emulates Bio::Fetch object in BioRuby as if
discontinued BioRuby BioFetch server were still alive. It overrides methods and
objects in Bio::Fetch, and if the old BioRuby BioFetch server's URL is given, it
intercepts all requests and converts them into existing web services such as
TogoWS, KEGG REST API, NCBI E-Utilities, and GenomeNet(genome.jp).
