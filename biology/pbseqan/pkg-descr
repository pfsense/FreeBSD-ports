This is a public fork of the SeqAn Library v2.0.0, stripped down to just the
header files and with a few custom fixes.

Some of PacBio's tools depend on SeqAn for efficient implementations of some
common data-structures for sequence analysis (A huge thanks to SeqAn
development team!). However PacBio only uses a small amount of the SeqAn
code-base, and in addition requires a few minor fixes that didn't make it in to
the initial release of SeqAn v2.0.0. Thus to minimize confusion and band-width,
we will depend on this fork instead of SeqAn proper.
