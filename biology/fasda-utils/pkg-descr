FASDA aims to provide a fast and simple differential analysis tool
that just works and does not require any knowledge beyond basic Unix
command-line skills. The code is written entirely in C to maximize
efficiency and portability, and to provide a simple command-line user
interface.

FASDA-utils is a collection of optional companion programs and
scripts.  They are separated from the main FASDA distribution in order
to keep FASDA packages minimal.
