Artemis is a DNA sequence viewer and annotation tool that allows
visualisation of sequence features and the results of analyses within
the context of the sequence, and its six-frame translation.  Artemis is
written in Java, reads EMBL or GENBANK format sequences and feature
tables, and can work on sequences of any size.

ACT (Artemis Comparison Tool) is a DNA sequence comparison viewer based
on Artemis. It can open two or more sequences (and their
annotations/features) together with their comparisons (usually the
result of running blastn or tblastx searches).
