LibCombine implements a C++ API library providing support for the Combine
Archive. The library is written after the likeness of libSBML (and in fact some
classes have been generated using DEVISER). Thus even thought he core is
written in C++, the classes can be accessed via SWIG from .NET, Java and Python.
