Optimise combinations of primers and minimise the formation of dimers in
multiplexed PCR.

Primer Pooler can:

* Check through each proposed pool for combinations that are likely to form
  dimers

* Automatically move prospective amplicons between proposed pools to reduce
  dimer formation

* Automatically search the genome sequence to find which amplicons overlap, and
  place their corresponding primers in separate pools

* Optionally keep pool sizes within a specified range

* Handle thousands of primers without being slow (useful for high-throughput
  sequencing applications)

* Do all of the above with degenerate primers too.
