Trimadap is a small tool to trim adapter sequences from Illumina data. It
performs SSE2-SW between each read and each adapter sequence and identifies
adapter sequences with a few heuristic rules which can be found in the
ta_trim1() function in trimadap-mt.c. The default adapters it uses are included
in illumina.txt. These are typical Illumina adapters from paired-end
sequencing.
