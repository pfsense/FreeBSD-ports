Fastahack is a small application for indexing and extracting sequences and
subsequences from FASTA files.  The included Fasta.cpp library provides a FASTA
reader and indexer that can be embedded into applications which would benefit
from directly reading subsequences from FASTA files.  The library automatically
handles index file generation and use.
