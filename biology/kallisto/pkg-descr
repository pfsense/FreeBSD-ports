Kallisto is a program for quantifying abundances of transcripts from RNA-Seq
data, or more generally of target sequences using high-throughput sequencing
reads. It is based on the novel idea of pseudoalignment for rapidly determining
the compatibility of reads with targets, without the need for alignment.
