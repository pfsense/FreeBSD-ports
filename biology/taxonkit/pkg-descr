TaxonKit allows to:
* list taxonomic subtrees (TaxIds)
* query taxonomic lineage of given TaxIds
* reformat lineage in canonical ranks
* convert scientific names to TaxIds
* filter TaxIds by taxonomic rank range
* compute lowest common ancestor (LCA) for TaxIds
* create TaxId changelog from dump archives
