MoChA is a bcftools plugin released under the MIT license for mosaic
chromosomal alteration detection and analysis from DNA microarray or
whole genome sequence data. It can be used both with Illumina and
Affymetrix data. It can also be used for detection of germline copy
number variants. Data can be prepared in usable file formats using the
gtc2vcf plugin.
