Biolibc is a library of fast, memory-efficient, low-level functions for
processing biological data.  Like libc, it consists of numerous disparate,
general-purpose functions which could be used by a wide variety of
applications.  These include functions for streaming common file formats such
as SAM and VCF, string functions specific to bioinformatics, etc.
