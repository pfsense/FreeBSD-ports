STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference) aims to achieve accurate
alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data.

STAR is based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses
sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed
by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by
a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 x
76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same
time improving alignment sensitivity and precision
