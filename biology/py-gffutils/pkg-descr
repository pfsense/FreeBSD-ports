gffutils is a Python package for working with and manipulating the GFF and GTF
format files typically used for genomic annotations. Files are loaded into a
sqlite3 database, allowing much more complex manipulation of hierarchical
features (e.g., genes, transcripts, and exons) than is possible with plain-text
methods alone.
