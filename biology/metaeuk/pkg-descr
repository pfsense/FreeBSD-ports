MetaEuk is a modular toolkit designed for large-scale gene discovery and
annotation in eukaryotic metagenomic contigs. MetaEuk combines the fast and
sensitive homology search capabilities of MMseqs2 with a dynamic programming
procedure to recover optimal exons sets. It reduces redundancies in multiple
discoveries of the same gene and resolves conflicting gene predictions on the
same strand. MetaEuk is GPLv3-licensed open source software that is implemented
in C++ and available for Linux and macOS. The software is designed to run
efficiently on multiple cores.
