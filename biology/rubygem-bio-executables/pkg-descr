bio-executables is a collection of miscellaneous utilities for bioinformatics
that were formerly part of the BioRuby core ("bio" gem). Because of reducing
complexity, they were moved to this gem.

This code has historically been part of the BioRuby gem, but has been split into
its own gem as part of an effort to modularize BioRuby. bio-executables and many
more plugins are available at biogems.info.
