VSEARCH supports de novo and reference based chimera detection, clustering,
full-length and prefix dereplication, rereplication, reverse complementation,
masking, all-vs-all pairwise global alignment, exact and global alignment
searching, shuffling, subsampling and sorting. It also supports FASTQ file
analysis, filtering, conversion and merging of paired-end reads.

The aim of this project is to create an alternative to the USEARCH tool
developed by Robert C. Edgar (2010).
