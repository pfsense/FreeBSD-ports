GCTA (Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis) was originally designed to estimate
the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genome- or chromosome-wide
SNPs for complex traits (the GREML method), and has subsequently extended for
many other analyses to better understand the genetic architecture of complex
traits.
