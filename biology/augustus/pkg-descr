AUGUSTUS is a program that predicts genes in eukaryotic genomic sequences.

AUGUSTUS usually belongs to the most accurate programs for the species it is
trained for. Often it is the most accurate ab initio program. For example, at
the independent gene finder assessment (EGASP) on the human ENCODE regions
AUGUSTUS was the most accurate gene finder among the tested ab initio programs.
At the more recent nGASP (worm), it was among the best in the ab initio and
transcript-based categories. See accuracy statistics for further details.
