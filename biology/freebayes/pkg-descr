FreeBayes is a Bayesian genetic variant detector designed to find small
polymorphisms, specifically SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms), indels
(insertions and deletions), MNPs (multi-nucleotide polymorphisms), and complex
events (composite insertion and substitution events) smaller than the length of
a short-read sequencing alignment.
