FigTree is designed as a graphical viewer of phylogenetic trees and as a program
for producing publication-ready figures. As with most of my programs, it was
written for my own needs so may not be as polished and feature-complete as a
commercial program. In particular it is designed to display summarized and
annotated trees produced by BEAST.
