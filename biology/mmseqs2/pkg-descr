MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many sequence searching) is a software suite to search
and cluster huge protein and nucleotide sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source
GPL-licensed software implemented in C++ for Linux, MacOS, and (as beta
version, via cygwin) Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores
and servers and exhibits very good scalability. MMseqs2 can run 10000 times
faster than BLAST. At 100 times its speed it achieves almost the same
sensitivity. It can perform profile searches with the same sensitivity as
PSI-BLAST at over 400 times its speed.
