MUSCLE is multiple alignment software for protein and nucleotide sequences.
The name stands for multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation.

A range of options is provided that give you the choice of optimizing
accuracy, speed, or some compromise between the two. Default parameters are
those that give the best average accuracy in the published tests. MUSCLE
can achieve both better average accuracy and better speed than CLUSTALW or
T-Coffee, depending on the chosen options.
