# Some notes on the specified options:
# - --config is necessary to point the program to the correct configuration
#   file.
# - --chdir is used to switch to a desired work directory. The program is going
#   to create a lot of files in its current working directory so should not be
#   just any directory on the system.
# - --pid-file specifies the location for the PID file.
# - --daemon is to detach the program from the terminal and run it
#   in the background.
