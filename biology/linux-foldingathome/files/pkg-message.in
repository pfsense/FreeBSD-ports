Quick start
===========

Here is a list of steps to quickly get started with Folding@home on FreeBSD:

1.	Mount linprocfs(5) in /compat/linux/proc.

2.	Mount linsysfs(5) in /compat/linux/sys.

3.	Consider setting the user name and the team ID (e.g., "11743")
	in %%FAHCLIENT_CONFIG_XML%%.

4.	Enable the fahclient service:

		sysrc fahclient_enable="YES"

5.	Start the service:

		service fahclient start

At this point, the daemon should be up and folding.

Additional notes
================

-	The current status of folding can be inspected by running
	the following command:

		service fahclient log

-	The default working directory for fahclient is %%FAHCLIENT_WORK_DIR%%.
	In order to function properly, fahclient requires its working directory
	to be on a partition/dataset with execute permissions on.  For example
	if /var/db is on a ZFS dataset with exec=off, then %%FAHCLIENT_WORK_DIR%%
	needs to have exec=on.

	Note, that usually the permissions are on unless the system
	configuration was modified by the administrator.

-	The ID of the FreeBSD team is 11743. In order to join the team
	add the following line to %%FAHCLIENT_CONFIG_XML%%:

		<team value="11743"/>

	The service has to be restarted to pick up the change.

	Statistics for the FreeBSD team can be viewed here:
	https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/11743

	software is available on those websites:
