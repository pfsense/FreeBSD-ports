Folding@home is a distributed computing project -- people from throughout
the world download and run software to band together to make one of the
largest supercomputers in the world.  Every computer takes the project
closer to our goals.

Folding@home uses novel computational methods coupled to distributed
computing, to simulate problems millions of times more challenging than
previously achieved.

Protein folding is linked to disease, such as Alzheimer's, ALS,
Huntington's, Parkinson's disease, and many Cancers.  Moreover, when
proteins do not fold correctly (i.e. "misfold"), there can be serious
consequences, including many well known diseases, such as Alzheimer's,
Mad Cow (BSE), CJD, ALS, Huntington's, Parkinson's disease, and many
cancers and cancer-related syndromes.
