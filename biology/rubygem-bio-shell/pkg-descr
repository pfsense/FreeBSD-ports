bio-shell, providing BioRuby Shell, is a command-line interface for BioRuby, an
open source bioinformatics library for Ruby.

This code has historically been part of the BioRuby gem, but has been split into
its own gem as part of an effort to modularize BioRuby. bio-shell and many more
plugins are available at biogems.info.
