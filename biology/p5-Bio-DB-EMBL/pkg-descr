Bio::DB::EMBL allows the dynamic retrieval of sequence objects Bio::Seq from the
EMBL database using the dbfetch script at EBI.

In order to make changes transparent we have host type (currently only ebi) and
location (defaults to ebi) separated out. This allows later additions of more
servers in different geographical locations.

The functionality of this module is inherited from Bio::DB::DBFetch which
implements Bio::DB::WebDBSeqI.
