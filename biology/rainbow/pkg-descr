Rainbow provides an ultra-fast and memory-efficient solution to clustering and
assembling short genetic sequence reads produced by Restriction site Associated
DNA Sequencing (RAD-seq).  It does this by, first, clustering reads using a
spaced seed method, then it divides potential groups into haplotypes in a
top-down manner.  Next, along a guide tree, it iteratively merges sibling
leaves in a bottom-up manner if they are similar enough.  Finally, Rainbow uses
a greedy algorithm to locally assemble merged reads into contigs.  Both optimal
and suboptimal assembly results are output.
