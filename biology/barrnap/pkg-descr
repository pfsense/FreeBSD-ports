Barrnap predicts the location of ribosomal RNA genes in genomes. It supports
bacteria (5S,23S,16S), archaea (5S,5.8S,23S,16S), metazoan mitochondria
(12S,16S) and eukaryotes (5S,5.8S,28S,18S).

It takes FASTA DNA sequence as input, and write GFF3 as output. It uses the new
nhmmer tool that comes with HMMER 3.1 for HMM searching in RNA:DNA style.
Multithreading is supported and one can expect roughly linear speed-ups with
more CPUs.
