scrm simulates the evolution of genetic sequences. It takes a neutral
evolutionary model as input, and generates random sequences that evolved under
the model. As coalescent simulator, it traces the ancestry of the sampled
sequences backwards in time and is therefore extremely efficient. Compared to
other coalescent simulators, it can simulate chromosome-scale sequences without
a measureable reduction of genetic linkage between different sites.
