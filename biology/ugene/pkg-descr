Unipro UGENE is multiplatform, open-source software with the main goal of
assisting molecular biologists without much expertise in bioinformatics to
manage, analyze, and visualize their data.  UGENE integrates widely used
bioinformatics tools within one common user interface.

UGENE toolkit supports multiple biological data formats and allows the
retrieval of data from remote data sources.  It provides visualization
modules for biological objects such as annotated genome sequences, Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS) assembly data, multiple sequence alignments,
phylogenetic trees, and 3D structures.
