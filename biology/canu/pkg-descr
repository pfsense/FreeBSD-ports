Canu is a fork of the Celera Assembler, designed for high-noise single-molecule
sequencing (such as the PacBio RS II/Sequel or Oxford Nanopore MinION).

Canu is a hierarchical assembly pipeline which runs in four steps:

    Detect overlaps in high-noise sequences using MHAP

    Generate corrected sequence consensus

    Trim corrected sequences

    Assemble trimmed corrected sequences
