Biostar-Tools is a metaport for installing all the tools necessary to work
through the Biostar Handbook, except for bedGrapToBigWig, which has license
restrictions.  If you need bedGraphToBigWig, run

	cd /usr/ports/biology/ucsc-userapps && make install clean

The handbook instructs the user to install these tools mostly via bioconda,
which then requires the user to activate the bioconda environment each time
they want to use the tools.  This meta-package installs all of the tools
except emboss to the default PATH so they just work without any special
environment.  Emboss commands are installed to /usr/local/emboss/bin due to
conflicts with other packages.

You can also install conda packages on FreeBSD.  For details, see

	/usr/ports/sysutils/linux-miniconda-installer/pkg-descr
