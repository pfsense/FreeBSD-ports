fastDNAml is a program derived from Joseph Felsenstein's version 3.3 DNAML
(part of his PHYLIP package). Users should consult the documentation for
DNAML before using this program.

fastDNAml is an attempt to solve the same problem as DNAML, but to do so
faster and using less memory, so that larger trees and/or more bootstrap
replicates become tractable. Much of fastDNAml is merely a recoding of the
PHYLIP 3.3 DNAML program from PASCAL to C.
