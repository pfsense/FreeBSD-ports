A standalone program for mapping and aligning cDNA sequences to a
genome. The program maps and aligns a single sequence with minimal
startup time and memory requirements, and provides fast batch
processing of large sequence sets. The program generates accurate
gene structures, even in the presence of substantial polymorphisms
and sequence errors, without using probabilistic splice site models.
Methodology underlying the program includes a minimal sampling
strategy for genomic mapping, oligomer chaining for approximate
alignment, sandwich DP for splice site detection, and microexon
identification with statistical significance testing.
