The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds regions of local similarity
between sequences. The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to
sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance of matches.
BLAST can be used to infer functional and evolutionary relationships between
sequences as well as help identify members of gene families.
