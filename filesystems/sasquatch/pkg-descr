The sasquatch project is a set of patches to the standard unsquashfs utility
(part of squashfs-tools) that attempts to add support for as many hacked-up
vendor-specific SquashFS implementations as possible.

It can be used in conjunction with binwalk to extract firmware images where
unsquashfs would fail, e.g.

  If the vendor has done something simple like just muck a bit with the header
  fields, sasquatch should sort it out.

  If the vendor has made changes to the underlying LZMA compression options,
  or to how these options are stored in the compressed data blocks, sasquatch
  will attempt to automatically resolve such customizations via a brute-force
  method.
