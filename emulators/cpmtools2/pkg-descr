This port allows to access CP/M file systems similar to the well-known mtools
package, which accesses MSDOS file systems. It contains the followin set of
tools:

  * cpmls - list sorted directory with output similar to ls, DIR, P2DOS DIR
    and CP/M3 DIR[FULL]
  * cpmcp - copy files from and to CP/M file systems
  * cpmrm - erase files from CP/M file systems
  * cpmchmod - change file permissions
  * cpmchattr - change file attributes
  * mkfs.cpm - make a CP/M file system
  * fsck.cpm - check and repair a CP/M file system (only simple errors can
    be repaired so far). Some images of broken file systems are provided.
  * fsed.cpm - view CP/M file system
  * manual pages for everything including the CP/M file system format

All CP/M file system features are supported. Password protection is ignored,
but a pseudo file [passwd] contains them decrypted.
