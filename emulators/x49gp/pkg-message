 Instructions

 - Start a HP 50g with "hp50g"

 - Start a HP 49G+ with "hp49g+"

 - You can run each calculator type independently with
   its own state and settings. Or create more than two
   by supplying a name:

     hp50g home
     hp50g work

 - To reset a calculator, remove its subdirectory
   under ~/.x49gp (or the whole directory).

 - A 64MB SD card is included, and shared between
   calculators. If you want to run multiple calculators
   simultaneously, you will probably need a different
   arrangement. The config file for each calculator can
   be edited to change the SD card file.

 - Remember to install the ARM Toolbox if you want to
   use HPGCC2 binaries.

 - Mount the SD card with:
     mdconfig -a -f ~/.x49gp/sdcard
     mount_msdosfs /dev/md0 /mnt

   When finished:
     umount /mnt
     mdconfig -d -u 0

 Known limitations

 - Cannot write to port 2. Libs will eat up your RAM.

 - HPGCC2/3 SD I/O is unstable.
