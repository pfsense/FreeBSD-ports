The IBM POWER9 Functional Simulator is a simulation environment developed by
IBM. It is designed to provide enough POWER9 processor complex functionality to
allow the entire software stack to execute, including loading, booting and
running a little endian Linux environment. The intent for this tool is to
educate, enable new application development, and to facilitate porting of
existing Linux applications to the POWER9 architecture. While the IBM POWER9
Functional Simulator serves as a full instruction set simulator for the POWER9
processor, it may not model all aspects of the IBM Power Systems POWER9 hardware
and thus may not exactly reflect the behavior of the POWER9 hardware.
