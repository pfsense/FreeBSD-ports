MAME is a multi-purpose emulation framework, with the aim of documenting and
preserving vintage software and hardware from becoming lost. When used with
vintage firmware (or BIOS), and duplicated Read Only Memory (ROMs), on modern
hardware, users are able to play and explore systems and games from
approximately 1970 through to the modern era.
