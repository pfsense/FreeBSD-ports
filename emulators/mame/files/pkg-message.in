  message: <<EOM
Sample configuration files have been installed in "%%ETCDIR%%/"
The configuration data can be copied to your "~/.mame" directory; alternatively,
to create clean copies of MAME's configuration, run "mame -createconfig",
the output from this can be stored in ~/.mame or elsewhere.

To run mame with a custom path, run "mame -inipath path-to-mame.ini"

By default, MAME will search and write to the current working directory, unless
it finds configuration data.
