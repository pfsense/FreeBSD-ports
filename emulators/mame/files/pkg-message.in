MAME follows an interesting User Experience (UX) design pattern that is aimed
for developers of MAME, as result of this, the expectation on file
configuration management might appear counter-intuitive to Users of MAME. If
MAME does not find configuration files, it expects to be able to read and write
configuration data to the current working directory, this is counter to
what users expect on their systems.

Sample configuration files have been installed in:
"%%ETCDIR%%/"
The samples can be copied to your "~/.mame" directory to avoid having MAME
write configuration data elsewhere.

To create clean copies of MAME's configuration files, execute:
"mame -createconfig"
the output from this can be stored in ~/.mame or a custom path.

To run MAME with custom configuration path(s), execute:
"mame -inipath /var/db/mame /usr/local/etc/mame"

See mame(6) for more information.
