The IBM POWER10 Functional Simulator is a simulation environment developed by
IBM. It is designed to provide enough POWER10 processor complex functionality to
allow the entire software stack to execute, including loading, booting and
running a little endian Linux environment. The intent for this tool is to
educate, enable new application development, and to facilitate porting of
existing Linux applications to the POWER10 architecture. While the IBM POWER10
Functional Simulator serves as a full instruction set simulator for the POWER10
processor, it may not model all aspects of the IBM Power Systems POWER10
hardware and thus may not exactly reflect the behavior of the POWER10 hardware.
