Imagine this nightmare scenario: your boss tells you about a legacy system you
have to support. How bad could it be? COBOL? Fortran? Worse: it's an embedded
6502 system run by a family of squirrels. Fortunately there's a pure Perl 6502
emulator that works so well the squirrels will never know the difference.
