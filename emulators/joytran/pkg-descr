Joytran is a joystick to keyboard/mouse events translator written in C.

The project has several advantages over similar software:

- Portable to a wide variety of platforms, since it is based on SDL and the X11
  XTest Extension (Developed on FreeBSD)
- It is easy to use the joystick in places where it is not usually supported
- Supports keyboard and mouse emulation
- Supports multiple joysticks
- Handles the presence of non-joystick devices, such as USB mice/trackballs
  that masquerade as joysticks gracefully
- Easy switching between profiles
- Lightweight, with few dependencies
- Comprehensive feature set (if there are features missing that are important
  to you, I will at least consider implementing them)
- Freely available (MIT License)
