Note that the executable files for some simulators have been renamed
to remove conflicts with other ports. In such cases, the name is now
prefixed with 'simh'. Affected simulators are:

	eclipse becomes simh-eclipse
	gri becomes simh-gri
	nova becomes simh-nova

Users may wish to create a symbolic link to these, or an alias,
if they want to use the old names.
