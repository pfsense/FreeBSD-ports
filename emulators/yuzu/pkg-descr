yuzu is an experimental open-source emulator for the Nintendo Switch
from the creators of Citra.

It is written in C++ with portability in mind, with builds actively
maintained for Windows and Linux. The emulator is capable of running
several commercial games.

yuzu only emulates a subset of Switch hardware and therefore most
commercial games do not run at full speed or are not fully functional.
