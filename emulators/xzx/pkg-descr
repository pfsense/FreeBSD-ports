XZX is a portable emulator of ZX Spectrum 48K/128K/+3 (8-bit home computers
made by Sir Clive Sinclair) for machines running UNIX and the X Window system.

XZX emulates either a Spectrum 48K, 128K or +3, Interface I with up to 8
microdrives, Multiface 128 (if you have the ROM image) and Kempston joystick.
XZX loads from .SNA, .Z80, .SLT, .DAT, .TAP, .TZX, .VOC, .MDR and .DSK files
and saves to .SNA, .Z80, .SLT, .TAP, .MDR, .DSK and .SCR files.

XZX will work with color (8,16,24,32bpp) and monochrome displays, where
contrasting colours are displayed with the darker colour in black and the
lighter colour in white, which works reasonably well. Halftoning is used if
the scaling factor is increased.
