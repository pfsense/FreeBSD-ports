For Sega Saturn, it is mandatory to install a supported Sega Saturn bios files
(such as saturn_bios.bin) in ~/.config/retroarch/system or
~/.config/retroarch/system/kronos.

Kronos is broadly compatible with all major Saturn BIOSes regardless of region,
although unlike Yabause, a BIOS dump is required.  Due to the aforementioned
BIOS compatibility, the BIOS guide for the beetle-saturn libretro core may be
helpful:

https://docs.libretro.com/library/beetle_saturn/

For ST-V, it is necessary to add a compatible stvbios.zip either in
~/.config/retroarch/system/kronos or in ~/.config/retroarch/system/.  In
contrast to MAME, Kronos will never search for this bios file in the local path
of the game.

If the emulator gets stuck on the BIOS screen, the screen remains blank, or
shows audio track navigation controls, then the BIOS is likely incompatible.

At present, Kronos is only compatible with a subset of the stvbios.zip files
used by modern MAME versions.  If the stvbios.zip is not present in the proper
place, but one of the proper Sega Saturn BIOSes is instead available, it will
try to default to one of those, and in the most optimistic case, merely reach
the audio CD track navigation controls, but it will not work, since it is not
the same hardware.

If in doubt, running retroarch with the -v argument may help to acquire more
diagnostic information.
