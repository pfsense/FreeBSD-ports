This project aims to develop a fast emulator for the TI89 (Titanium), 92(+),
and V200PLT calculators.  This emulator started on the Jonas Minnberg's
(X)Tiger emulator which is based on UAE (the Universal Amiga Emulator).  It
was deeply reworked and improved, thus it's very different now.

TiEmu uses the GDK library (GTK component) for display.  The GUI has been
written with GTK+ (the Gimp ToolKit).
