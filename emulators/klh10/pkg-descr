This is a port of Kenneth L. Harrenstien's KLH10 DEC PDP-10 mainframe
emulator.

This port currently only builds klh10 in the ksits configuration for
running MIT Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS.)  Future release
will configure KLH10 for additional systems.

Warning: to make use of KLH10 over a LAN the network driver
subprocesses (currently only dpimp is built and installed
automatically) must run as root in order use the tun(4) network
interface and to insert proxy ARP table entries.  If you do not want
dpimp to be setuid root you must run the emulator from the root
account to use networking.  KLH10 may be run without networking and
only provide console access to a single user without using any root
privileges.  We do not know if KLH10's network driver subprocesses
have been audited for buffer overflows, etc only that they accept
incoming TCP connections and require root privileges.  You take your
chances running this in the default configuration.  Consider using a
firewall to limit access to klh-10.  See the pub-its/adm directory for
firewall documentation.
