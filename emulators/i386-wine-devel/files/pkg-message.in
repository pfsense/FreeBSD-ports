Some ZFS tuning guides recommend setting KVA_PAGES=512 in your kernel
configuration.  This is incompatible with Wine.  The maximum possible
is KVA_PAGES=500, which should still be enough for ZFS.

The port also installs some of Wine's documentation which describes
additional programs that are not in the manual pages under
  %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/wine
There is more in the source tree but the others are only useful in
conjunction with the rest of the source tree.

This package requires procfs(5) mounted on /proc.

If you have not done it yet, please do the following:

	mount -t procfs proc /proc

To make it permanent, you need the following line in /etc/fstab:

	proc	/proc		procfs		rw	0	0
