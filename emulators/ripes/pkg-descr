Ripes is a graphical processor simulator and assembly code editor built
for the RISC-V instruction set architecture, suitable for teaching how
assembly level code is executed on various microarchitectures.

Ripes may be used to explore concepts such as how machine code is executed
on a variety of microarchitectures (RV32IMC/RV64IMC based), how different
cache designs influence performance, how C and assembly code is compiled
and assembled to executable machine code, and how a processor interacts
with memory-mapped I/O.
