ARAnyM is a multiplatform virtual machine (a software layer, or an emulator) for
running Atari ST/TT/Falcon operating systems and applications on almost any
hardware with many host operating systems. The reason for writing ARAnyM is to
provide Atari power users with faster and better machines. The ultimate goal is
to create a new platform where TOS/GEM applications could continue to live
forever.
