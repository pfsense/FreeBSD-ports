+2004-12-25  Andreas Alich
+	* di_dis.c
+	  Fixes a number of bugs of the disassembler
+	  (which led to wrong output and also to crashes).
+	  The disassembler still disassembles lots of invalid instructions
+	  (opcode/adressing modes) without any hint that they are invalid.
+	  But at least valid instructions should be disassembled correctly now.
+
+2004-12-25  Andreas Alich
+	* gemdos.c
+	  Increases compatibility of STonx with real GEMDOS:
+	  Fdatime did not return correct date/time (conversion missing).
+	  Setting date/time was not implemented (now needs /proc-based OS).
+	  Reading in files opened with Fcreate was not possible.
+	  Fopen allowed opening directories.
+	  Fopen/Fcreate did not return error in case of invalid path.
