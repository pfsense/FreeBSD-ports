On some hardware, The libretro core of reicast may not run if dynarec is
enabled.

It is recommended to set alpha sorting to per-triangle, as follows:

In ~/.config/retroarch/
reicast_alpha_sorting = "per-triangle (normal)"

It is recommended to enable DSP support:

reicast_enable_dsp = "enabled"

in ~/.config/reicast/emu.cfg:

Dynarec.DspEnabled = 1
Dynarec.Enabled = no
Dynarec.idleskip = yes
Dynarec.safe-mode = yes
Dynarec.unstable-opt = no
#aica.AutoLatency = no
#aica.DSPEnabled = no

Please set all lines in ~/.config/retroarch/retroarch.cfg that correspond to
the setting "run_ahead_enabled" to "false", as shown in the example below:

run_ahead_enabled = "false"

To troubleshoot issues, running retroarch with the -v argument may help to
acquire more diagnostic information.
