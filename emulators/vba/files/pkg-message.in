The default configuration file has been installed as
%%LOCALBASE%%/bin/VisualBoyAdvance.cfg-default. Please copy it to
%%LOCALBASE%%/bin/VisualBoyAdvance.cfg before you start the emulator.

If all you see after loading a ROM is a black screen and/or
VisualBoy Advance crashes, try switching the video filter.
Either change it in the global config file or use the -f switch.
