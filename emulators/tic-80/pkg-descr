TIC-80 is a free and open source fantasy computer for making, playing
and sharing tiny games.

With TIC-80 you get built-in tools for development: code, sprites, maps,
sound editors and the command line, which is enough to create a mini
retro game.

Games are packaged into a cartridge file, which can be easily
distributed. TIC-80 works on all popular platforms.  This means your
cartridge can be played in any device.

To make a retro styled game, the whole process of creation and execution
takes place under some technical limitations: 240x136 pixel display,
16 color palette, 256 8x8 color sprites, 4 channel sound, etc.
