o Make sure your kernel has been configured with options SHMMAXPGS=4096
  when you run on display 16bpp or deeper color.

o Copy %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/xsys35rc.sample
  to ~/.xsys35rc and fit it to your environment.

o Install game data from AliceSoft's cdrom with
  %%PREFIX%%/bin/instgame.

o pcm0 sound device doesn't work well with this program for now.
  Try snd0 instead, OSS commercial product or
  `-devdsp none' command line option as the last resort.

Enjoy!
