PPSSPP is a HLE ("high level emulation") emulator, it simulates the
PSP OS as seen by the game rather than the full hardware. A program
running on the PSP OS can send raw display lists to the graphics
chips, but can't access the flash controller or the Media Engine
directly, instead it has to go through libraries and the PSP OS
kernel. We simply simulate these. This is a lot of work though, the
PSP OS is large and has plenty of functionality so achieving 100%
compatibility is difficult bordering on the impossible. We can get
close though.
