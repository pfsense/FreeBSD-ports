Known issues:
- Default assignment of joystick buttons requires evdev-based driver e.g.,
  hgame(4) on FreeBSD >= 13.0, sysutils/iichid or multimedia/webcamd.
  If your joystick isn't detected consider defining SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG
  in environ(7) after generating the entry via controllermap (or antimicro).
