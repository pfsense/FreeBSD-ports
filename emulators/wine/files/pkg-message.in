Wine requires procfs(5) mounted on /proc. You can do so manually via
  mount -t procfs proc /proc
or make it permanent via something like the following in /etc/fstab
  proc   /proc   procfs   rw   0 0

Some ZFS tuning guides recommend setting KVA_PAGES=512 in your kernel
configuration.  This is incompatible with Wine.  The maximum possible
is KVA_PAGES=500, which should still be enough for ZFS.

The port also installs some of Wine's documentation which describes
additional programs that are not in the manual pages under
  %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/wine
