Color maps designed to improve graph readability for readers with
common forms of color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. The
color maps are also perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and
also when converted to black-and-white for printing. This package
also contains 'ggplot2' bindings for discrete and continuous color
and fill scales. A lean version of the package called 'viridisLite'
that does not include the 'ggplot2' bindings can be found at
<https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridisLite>.
