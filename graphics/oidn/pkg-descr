Intel Open Image Denoise is an open source library of high-performance,
high-quality denoising filters for images rendered with ray tracing. Open Image
Denoise is part of the Intel Rendering Framework and is released under the
permissive Apache 2.0 license.

The purpose of Open Image Denoise is to provide an open, high-quality,
efficient, and easy-to-use denoising library that allows one to significantly
reduce rendering times in ray tracing based rendering applications. It filters
out the Monte Carlo noise inherent to stochastic ray tracing methods like path
tracing, reducing the amount of necessary samples per pixel by even multiple
orders of magnitude (depending on the desired closeness to the ground truth).
A simple but flexible C/C++ API ensures that the library can be easily
integrated into most existing or new rendering solutions.
