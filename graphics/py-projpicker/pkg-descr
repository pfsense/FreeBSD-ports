ProjPicker (projection picker) is a Python module that allows the user to
select all coordinate reference systems (CRSs) whose extent completely contains
given points, polylines, polygons, and bounding boxes using set-theoretic
logical operators in a postfix notation. The goal is to make it easy and visual
to select a desired projection by location.
