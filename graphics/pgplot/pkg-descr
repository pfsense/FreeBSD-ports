PGPLOT is a Fortran subroutine package for drawing graphs on a variety
of display devices. For more details, see the manual ``PGPLOT Graphics
Subroutine Library'', available from T. J. Pearson.

The CPGPLOT library adds an intermediate level of wrapper functions
between C programs and the PGPLOT library. These functions hide the
system dependencies of calling PGPLOT behind a system independent
interface.

Documentation and demo programs are included.
