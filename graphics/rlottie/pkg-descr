rlottie is a platform independent standalone c++ library for rendering vector
based animations and art in realtime.

Lottie loads and renders animations and vectors exported in the bodymovin JSON
format. Bodymovin JSON can be created and exported from After Effects with
bodymovin, Sketch with Lottie Sketch Export, and from Haiku.
