ART is a free, open-source, cross-platform raw image processing program. ART is
a derivative of the popular RawTherapee, trading a bit of customization and
control over various processing parameters for a simpler and (hopefully) easier
to use interface, while still maintaining the power and quality of RawTherapee.
