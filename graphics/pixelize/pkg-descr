Pixelize works by splitting up the image you want rendered (or duplicated)
into a grid of small rectangular areas. Each area is analyzed, and replaced
with an image chosen from a large database of images. Pixelize tries to pick
images that best match each area.

Pixelize works best when it can choose images from a very large database of
images. With about 1000 images, Pixelize can do a reasonable job.
