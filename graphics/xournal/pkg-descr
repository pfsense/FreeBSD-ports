Xournal is an application for notetaking, sketching, keeping a journal using a
stylus. It is similar to Microsoft Windows Journal or to other alternatives such
as Jarnal, Gournal, and NoteLab.

Xournal aims to provide superior graphical quality (subpixel resolution) and
overall functionality; however it lacks the collaborative features of Jarnal.
Since Xournal is still in its early development stages, it may not be fully
stable, and some features have not been implemented yet.

Xournal supports annotation of PDF files through the Poppler library; PDF files,
much like paper styles, are loaded as an immutable background image.
