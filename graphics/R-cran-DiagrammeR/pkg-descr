Build graph/network structures using functions for stepwise addition
and deletion of nodes and edges. Work with data available in tables
for bulk addition of nodes, edges, and associated metadata. Use
graph selections and traversals to apply changes to specific nodes
or edges. A wide selection of graph algorithms allow for the analysis
of graphs. Visualize the graphs and take advantage of any aesthetic
properties assigned to nodes and edges.Create graph diagrams and
flowcharts using R.
