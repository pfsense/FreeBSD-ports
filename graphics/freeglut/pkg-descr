freeglut is a completely OpenSourced alternative to the OpenGL Utility
Toolkit (GLUT) library. GLUT was originally written by Mark Kilgard to
support the sample programs in the second edition OpenGL 'RedBook'.
Since then, GLUT has been used in a wide variety of practical applications
because it is simple, universally available and highly portable.

GLUT (and hence freeglut) allows the user to create and manage windows
containing OpenGL contexts on a wide range of platforms and also read the
mouse, keyboard and joystick functions.

freeglut is released under the X-Consortium license.
