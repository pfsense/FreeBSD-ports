Developer's Image Library (DevIL) is a programmer's library to develop
applications with very powerful image loading capabilities, yet is easy for
a developer to learn and use. Ultimate control of images is left to the
developer, so unnecessary conversions, etc. are not performed. DevIL utilizes
a simple, yet powerful, syntax. DevIL can load, save, convert, manipulate,
filter and display a wide variety of image formats.

Currently, DevIL can load and save many different image formats.

DevIL currently supports the following APIs for display:
OpenGL, Windows GDI, SDL, DirectX and Allegro.
Compilers that can compile DevIL or use it include Djgpp, MSVC++, gcc,
Delphi, Visual Basic, Power Basic and Dev-C++.

Many people may have known DevIL as OpenIL, but the name was changed due to
SGI's request.
