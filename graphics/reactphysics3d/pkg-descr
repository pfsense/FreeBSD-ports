ReactPhysics3D is a C++ physics engine library that can be used in 3D
simulations and games.

ReactPhysics3D has the following features:
* Rigid body dynamics
* Discrete collision detection
* Collision shapes (Sphere, Box, Capsule, Convex Mesh, Static Concave Mesh)
* Multiple collision shapes per body
* Broadphase collision detection (Dynamic AABB tree)
* Narrowphase collision detection (SAT/GJK)
* Collision response and friction (Sequential Impulses Solver)
* Joints (Ball and Socket, Hinge, Slider, Fixed)
* Collision filtering with categories
* Ray casting
* Sleeping technique for inactive bodies
* Multi-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X)
* No external libraries (do not use STL containers)
* Documentation (user manual and Doxygen API)
* Testbed application with demos
* Integrated Profiler
