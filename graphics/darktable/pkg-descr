Darktable is a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers: an open
source photography workflow application and raw image developer.  It manages
digital negatives in a database and lets one view them through a zoomable
lighttable.  It also enables one to develop raw images and enhance them.

Darktable tries to fill the gap between many excellent existing free raw
converters and image management tools (such as UFRaw or F-Spot).  The user
interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and mipmaps,
all stored in a database.  The user will always be able to interact, even
if the full resolution image is not yet loaded.

All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image
buffers for display.  The full image is only converted during export.  The
frontend is written in Gtk+/Cairo, the database uses SQLite3, raw image
loading is done using libraw and rawspeed, high-dynamic range and standard
image formats such as JPEG are also supported.  The core operates completely
on floating point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography
but also for scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high
dynamic range).
