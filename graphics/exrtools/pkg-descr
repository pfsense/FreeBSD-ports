exrtools is a set of simple command-line utilities for manipulating
with high dynamic range images in OpenEXR format. OpenEXR is a high
dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by Industrial Light
& Magic for use in computer imaging applications.

exrtools was developed to help experiment with batch processing of
HDR images for tone mapping. Each application is small and
reasonably self-contained such that the source code may be of most
value to others.

exrtools currently only works with RGBA OpenEXR files. As well, the
code assumes that the EXR files and PNG files all use sRGB primaries
and gamma function.
