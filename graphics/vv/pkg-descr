Open-source and cross platform image viewer, designed for fast and simple
visualization of spatio-temporal images: 2D, 2D+t, 3D and 3D+t (or 4D) images.

VV is designed for qualitative evaluation of image registration and deformation
field visualization. It contains several tools for superimposing images using
complementary colors or transparency, visualizing vector fields and defining
landmarks.
