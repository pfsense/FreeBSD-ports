Vulkan is an Explicit API, enabling direct control over how GPUs
actually work. By design, minimal error checking is done inside a
Vulkan driver. Applications have full control and responsibility for
correct operation. Any errors in how Vulkan is used can result in a
crash. This project provides Vulkan validation layers that can be
enabled to assist development by enabling developers to verify their
applications correct use of the Vulkan API.
