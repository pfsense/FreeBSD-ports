PyVista is a helper module for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) that
wraps the VTK library through NumPy and direct array access through
a variety of methods and classes. This package provides a Pythonic,
well-documented interface exposing VTK's powerful visualization
backend to facilitate rapid prototyping, analysis, and visual
integration of spatially referenced datasets.

This module can be used for scientific plotting for presentations and
research papers as well as a supporting module for other mesh 3D
rendering dependent Python modules; see Connections for a list of
projects that leverage PyVista.
