timg - Terminal Image and Video Viewer

A user-friendly viewer that uses 24-Bit color capabilities
and unicode character blocks to display images, animations
and videos in the terminal.
Displays regular images, plays animated gifs, scrolls
static images and plays videos.

Very useful for if you want to have a quick visual check
without starting a bulky image viewer or in an SSH session.
