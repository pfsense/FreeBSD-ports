The C++ Bitmap Library consists of simple, robust, optimized and portable
processing routines for the 24-bit per pixel bitmap image format.

The library has the following capabilities:
* Read/Write 24-bit Bitmap Images
* Pixel, row or column level batch editing
* Colour conversions (RGB,YCbCr) in byte and floating values
* Highly optimized subsample and upsample (resizing)
* Various colour maps (1000 levels - autumn, copper, gray, hot, hsv, jet, prism,
  vga, yarg)
* Texture generation (checkered pattern, plasma)
* Graphics drawing interface (line, line-segment, rectangle, triangle, quadix,
  horizontal and vertical line-segments, ellipse, circle, plot pixel, pen width,
  pen colour)
* Cartesian canvas and associated drawing interface
* PSNR and Image comparisons
* Simple nearest colour match from set of colours
* Wavelength to RGB approximations
* Single header file solution requires no installation or building
