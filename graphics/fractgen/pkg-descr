FractGen is a simple Qt-based fractal generator program for Mandelbrot
fractals.  The image size is only limited by virtual memory. It is possible
to zoom into images. Image parameters can be saved in XML files and loaded
from XML files. Calculated images can be exported as PNG files. The intention
of this program is to generate graphics to be post-processed by other image
tools, e.g. in order to generate nice screen backgrounds or book covers.
