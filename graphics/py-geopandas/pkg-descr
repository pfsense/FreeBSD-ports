GeoPandas is a project to add support for geographic data to pandas objects.
It currently implements GeoSeries and GeoDataFrame types which are subclasses
of pandas.Series and pandas.DataFrame respectively. GeoPandas objects can act
on shapely geometry objects and perform geometric operations.

GeoPandas geometry operations are cartesian. The coordinate reference system
(crs) can be stored as an attribute on an object, and is automatically set when
loading from a file. Objects may be transformed to new coordinate systems with
the to_crs() method. There is currently no enforcement of like coordinates for
operations, but that may change in the future.
