PyQtGraph is a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt4/PySide and
numpy. It is intended for use in mathematics/scientific/engineering
applications. Despite being written entirely in python, the library is very
fast due to its heavy leverage of numpy for number crunching and Qt's
GraphicsView framework for fast display.
