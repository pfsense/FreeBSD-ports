Waffle is a cross-platform C library that allows one to defer selection
of an OpenGL API and window system until runtime. For example, on Linux,
Waffle enables an application to select X11/EGL with an OpenGL 3.3
core profile, Wayland with OpenGL ES2, and other window system / API
combinations.

Waffle's immediate goal is to enable Piglit, Mesa's OpenGL test suite,
to test multiple OpenGL flavors in a cross-platform way. However,
Waffle's design does not preclude it from being useful to other
projects.
