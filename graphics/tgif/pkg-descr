Tgif is an interactive drawing tool that allows the user to draw and
manipulate objects in the X Window System. It's also a hyper-graphics (or
hyper-structured-graphics) browser on the World-Wide-Web. Its hyper-text
home page is http://bourbon.usc.edu:8001/tgif/ and its hyper-graphics
home page is http://bourbon.usc.edu:8001/tgif/index.obj.

Tgif drawings can be converted to a variety of formats, including GIF,
encapsulated PostScript and XBM.

Version 4 has a completely revamped 3-D user interface, as well as a host
of new features.
