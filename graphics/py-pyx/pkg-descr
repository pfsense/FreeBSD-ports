PyX is a Python package for the creation of PostScript, PDF, and SVG files. It
combines an abstraction of the PostScript drawing model with a TeX/LaTeX
interface. Complex tasks like 2d and 3d plots in publication-ready quality are
built out of these primitives.

Features:
- PostScript, PDF, and SVG output for device independent, freely scalable
  figures
- seamless TeX/LaTeX integration
- full access to PostScript features like paths, linestyles, fill patterns,
  transformations, clipping, bitmap inclusion, etc.
- advanced geometric operations on paths like intersections, transformations,
  splitting, smoothing, etc.
- sophisticated graph generation: modular design, pluggable axes, axes
  partitioning based on rational number arithmetics, flexible graph styles, etc.
