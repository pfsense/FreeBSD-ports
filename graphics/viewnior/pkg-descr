Viewnior is insipred by big projects like Eye of Gnome, because of it's
usability and richness,and by GPicView, because of it's lightweight design
and minimal interface. So here comes Viewnior - small and light,
with no compromise with the quality of it's functions.
The program is made with better integration in mind (follows Gnome HIG2)
