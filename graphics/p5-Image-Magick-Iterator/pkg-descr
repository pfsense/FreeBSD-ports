Image::Magick::Iterator adds iteration support to Image::Magick. This means that
if you have a stream of concatenated images, you can access each image in the
stream as an independent Image::Magick object.

Iteration functionality is not present in Image::Magick itself as of version
5.56. Passing a stream of concatenated images would result in essentially a
"stack" of images which would all be manipulated in parallel by any
Image::Magick calls. Calls to Write() either output an animated series of image
(a la animated GIFs), or the first image in the series.
