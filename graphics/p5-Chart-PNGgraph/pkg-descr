Chart::PNGgraph is a perl5 module to create and display PNG output for a graph.
The following classes for graphs with axes are defined:

Chart::PNGgraph::lines
    Create a line chart.
Chart::PNGgraph::bars
    Create a bar chart.
Chart::PNGgraph::points
    Create an chart, displaying the data as points.
Chart::PNGgraph::linespoints
    Combination of lines and points.
Chart::PNGgraph::area
    Create a graph, representing the data as areas under a line.
Chart::PNGgraph::mixed
    Create a mixed type graph, any combination of the above. At the moment this
    is fairly limited. Some of the options that can be used with some of the
    individual graph types won't work very well. Multiple bar graphs in a mixed
    graph won't display very nicely.

Chart::PNGgraph::pie
    Create a pie chart.
