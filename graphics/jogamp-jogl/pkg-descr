The JOGL project hosts the development version of the Java (TM) Binding for the
OpenGL API (JSR-231), and is designed to provide hardware-supported 3D graphics
to applications written in Java. JOGL provides full access to the APIs in the
OpenGL 1.3 - 3.0, >= 3.1, ES 1.x and ES 2.x specification as well as nearly all
vendor extensions. It integrates with the AWT and Swing widget sets, as well
with custom windowing toolkits using the NativeWindow API. It is part of a
suite of open-source technologies initiated by the Game Technology Group at Sun
Microsystems.
