Multican is Canon EOS cameras USB remote control utility for 300D, 350D, 30D,
20D, and 5D.  Multican allows scripted remote control of multiple cameras; it
is possible to control up to six cameras attached at the same time.

Multican communicates with camera directly, without generic library such as
provided by gPhoto2, and currently has no GUI, which makes it no replacement
for Canon's EOS Utility, but it can be useful nonetheless in various setups,
e.g. for astrophotography.
