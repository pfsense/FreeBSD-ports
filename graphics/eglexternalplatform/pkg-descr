This is a work-in-progress specification of the EGL External Platform
interface for writing EGL platforms and their interactions with modern
window systems on top of existing low-level EGL platform
implementations. This keeps window system implementation specifics out
of EGL drivers by using application-facing EGL functions.

Examples of low-level EGL platforms are EGL_EXT_platform_device or
EGL_KHR_platform_gbm.
