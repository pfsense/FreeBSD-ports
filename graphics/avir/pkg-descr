High-quality pro image resizing / scaling C++ library, image resize.

This library features routines for both down- and upsizing of 8- and 16-bit,
1 to 4-channel images. Image resizing routines were implemented in
multi-platform C++ code, and have a high level of optimality. Beside resizing,
this library offers a sub-pixel shift operation. Built-in sRGB gamma correction
is available.
