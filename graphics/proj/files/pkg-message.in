Since proj 7, datum grids are available from a CDN at https://cdn.proj.org
and should either be fetched dynamically at run time (disabled by default,
cf. https://proj.org/usage/network.html) or be fetched locally depending on
one's work area needs, using the `projsync' command.

DATA option allows to download all the data, but requires more than 1.1GB.
This option is disabled by default, as it is better to use the `projsync'
command.

Execute `projsync --list-files' command to list the CDN contents.

They can either by installed in the user home directory (under
~/.local/share/proj):

$ projsync --file fr_ign_ntf_r93.tif
Downloading from https://cdn.proj.org into /home/user/.local/share/proj
Total to download: 93581 bytes
Downloading https://cdn.proj.org/fr_ign_ntf_r93.tif... (1 / 1)

Or system-wide in the default $PROJ_LIB directory (under
%%PREFIX%%/share/proj, cf. https://proj.org/resource_files.html):

# projsync --system-directory --file fr_ign_ntf_r93.tif
Downloading from https://cdn.proj.org into %%PREFIX%%/share/proj
Total to download: 93581 bytes
Downloading https://cdn.proj.org/fr_ign_ntf_r93.tif... (1 / 1)

If not using the default, make sure to set PROJ_LIB environment variable
accordingly.
