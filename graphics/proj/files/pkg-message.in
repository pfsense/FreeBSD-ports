Since proj 7, datum grids are available from a CDN at https://cdn.proj.org and
should either be fetched dynamically at runtime (disabled by default, cf
https://proj.org/usage/network.html) or be fetched locally depending on your
work area needs, using the projsync command. 

DATA option allows you to download all the data, but it requires more than 400mb!
This option is disabled by default.

It is better to use the projsync command.

Use projsync --list-files to list the CDN content.

They can either by installed in the user homedir (under ~/.local/share/proj)

$ projsync --file fr_ign_ntf_r93.tif

or systemwide in the default PROJ_LIB dir (under %%PREFIX%%/share/proj, cf
https://proj.org/resource_files.html)

# projsync --system-directory --file fr_ign_ntf_r93.tif

If not using the default, make sure to set PROJ_LIB environment variable
accordingly.
