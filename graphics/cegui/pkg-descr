Crazy Eddie's GUI System is a free library providing windowing and widgets for
graphics APIs / engines where such functionality is not natively available, or
severely lacking. The library is object orientated, written in C++, and
targeted at games developers who should be spending their time creating great
games, not building GUI sub-systems!
