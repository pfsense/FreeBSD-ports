This is the Image Compiler, which generates images from textual description.
Most important features include:

  - Does not need display to run
  - Can be run from the command line or as CGI script.  In the latter case,
    the image is output to the browser (in PNG or JPEG format)
  - The size of the output image is automatically determined, no size has to
    be specified (although you can give a fixed size
  - Coordinates are in pixels, only positive coordinates are visible.  Angles
    are in integer degrees, no limitations (except the maximum integer limit).
    Colors can be specified in one of three formats, including X11 color
    (rgb) strings
  - A pre-processor can be applied on the input file first; simple
    arithmetic can be performed
  - Supports commands for drawing lines, circles (filled or not), rectangles
    (filled or not), ellipses (filled or not), arcs, and text.  Images can
    also be imported.  For text and images an alignment parameter is
    available, and text and images can be rotated over any angle and can
    also be mirrored
