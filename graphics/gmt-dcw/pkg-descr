The Digital Chart of the World (DCW) is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000 scale vector
basemap of the world. The charts were designed to meet the needs of pilots and
air crews in medium-and low-altitude en route navigation and to support military
operational planning, intelligence briefings, and other needs.
