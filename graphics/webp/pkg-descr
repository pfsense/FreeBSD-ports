WebP is a new image format that provides lossless and lossy compression for
images on the web. WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to
PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller in size compared to JPEG images at
equivalent SSIM index. WebP supports lossless transparency (also known as alpha
channel) with just 22% additional bytes. Transparency is also supported with
lossy compression and typically provides 3x smaller file sizes compared to PNG
when lossy compression is acceptable for the red/green/blue color channels.

Webmasters and web developers can use the WebP image format to create smaller
and richer images that can help make the web faster.
