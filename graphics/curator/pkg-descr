Curator is a powerful script that allows one to generate web page image
galleries with the intent of displaying photographic images on the Web, or for
a CD-ROM presentation or archiving.

It generates static web pages only - no special configuration or running
scripts are required on the server. The script supports many file formats,
hierarchical directories, thumbnail generation and update, per-image
description file with any attributes, and 'tracks' of images spanning multiple
directories.
