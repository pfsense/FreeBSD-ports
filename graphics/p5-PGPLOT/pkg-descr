'pgperl' is a version of the Perl language which has available
the PGPLOT FORTRAN library, a very popular package for plotting
astronomical data. (As a glance through any issue of ApJ or MNRAS will
confirm.) The details of this involve some complicated C glue routines
but are transparent to the user.

See the file LICENSE in /usr/local/share/doc/pgperl for copyright/licensing
information and the file pgperl.doc on how to use pgplot from perl.
