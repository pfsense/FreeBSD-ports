The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and reliable ffmpeg wrapper
for working with video files. It implements two simple generator functions for
reading and writing data from/to ffmpeg, which reliably terminate the ffmpeg
process when done. It also takes care of publishing platform-specific wheels
that include the binary ffmpeg executables.

This library is used as the basis for the imageio ffmpeg plugin, but it can also
be used by itself. Imageio provides a higher level API, and adds support for
e.g. cameras and seeking.
