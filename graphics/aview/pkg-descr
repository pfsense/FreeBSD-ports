Aview is powerful graphics viewer which utilize the aalib API and allows
viewing netpbm format (and others in the presence of netpbm or ImageMagick)
on console (using slang) and X.
There are three programs.

aview: the main program which could used to view pnm, ppm, pgm and pbm
	files. It runs under X or slang.

asciiview: a shell script wraps around aview to allow wider range of image
	formats to be viewed. Netpbm package is required for the conversion.

aaflip: a program to view flip animation using ascii text. Works under X
	and slang.

You could press h to get help. You may also save the pics in various text
format. Thanks to aalib!
