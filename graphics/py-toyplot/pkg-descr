Toyplot is a kid-sized plotting toolkit for Python with grownup-sized goals:

* Develop beautiful interactive, animated plots that embrace the unique
  capabilities of electronic publishing and support repoducibility.
* Create the best possible data graphics out-of-the-box, maximizing data ink
  and minimizing chartjunk.
* Provide a clean, minimalist interface that scientists and engineers will
  love.
