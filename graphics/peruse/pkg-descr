A comic book reader app

This is an application for reading comic books distributed in various digital
formats. It is based on KDE's Frameworks 5, and the UI is built using Qt
Quick2.

File discovery is done using Baloo when available and enabled, and otherwise
through a simple file system digger. The Baloo method is both faster and more
featureful, and you should be using that whenever possible.
