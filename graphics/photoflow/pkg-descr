The aim of the project is to provide a fully non-destructive photo retouching
program with a complete workflow including RAW image development.

Here is the general feature/wish list:
* Fully non-destructive, layer-based photo editing workflow with realtime
  preview of the final image
* Support for 8-bits and 16-bits integer as well as 32-bits and 64-bits floating
  point precision, selectable at runtime and on a per-image basis
* Allows to load and edit images of arbitrary size, thanks to the underlying
  rendering engine based on the VIPS library
* Fully color managed workflow: user-defined input, work and output profiles,
  soft-proofing, etc...
* Support for layer grouping and layer masks
* Support for common photo editing tools: levels, curves, brightness-contrast
  control, blurring, sharpening, cropping, resizing, colorspace conversions,
  etc..., all implemented in the form of image layers
