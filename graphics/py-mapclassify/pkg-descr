Classification Schemes for Choropleth Maps

mapclassify implements a family of classification schemes for choropleth maps.
Its focus is on the determination of the number of classes, and the assignment
of observations to those classes. It is intended for use with upstream mapping
and geovisualization packages (see geopandas and geoplot) that handle the
rendering of the maps.
