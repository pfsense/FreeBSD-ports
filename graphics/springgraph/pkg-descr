Springgraph will read in a .dot file description of a graph, which, for each
node, specifies its name and which other nodes it is connected to, and then
renders a graph. Each node is drawn as an ellipse, and each connection is
drawn as an arrow. The node placement is a result of all of the nodes moving
away from each other, while all nodes which are connected move toward each
other. This movement is repeated until it stabilizes.

Springgraph was written as an alternative to neato, which is part of graphviz.
It attempts to read the same .dot files used by graphviz, but currently only
supports a limited number of node attributes (label and fillcolor). I am open
to requests for support for more graph/node/edge attributes.
