Interactive 3D mesh retopology software developed as part of the publication
"Instant Field-Aligned Meshes", ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proceedings of
SIGGRAPH Asia, 2015).

The application implements a novel approach to remesh a surface into an
isotropic triangular or quad-dominant mesh using a unified local smoothing
operator that optimizes both the edge orientations and vertex positions in
the output mesh.  The algorithm produces meshes with high isotropy while
naturally aligning and snapping edges to sharp features.
