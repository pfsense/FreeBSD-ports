Cuttlefish produces animated GIFs that reveal the interplay
between the diurnal and geographical patterns of displayed
data. By showing how the Sun's shadow covers the world map,
cuttlefish yields a direct feeling for the time of day at
a given geographic region, while moving graphs illustrate
the relationship between local time and the visualized
events.
