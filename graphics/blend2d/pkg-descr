Blend2D is a high performance 2D vector graphics engine written in C++ and
released under the Zlib license. It has a built-in JIT compiler that generates
optimized pipelines at runtime. Additionally, the engine features a new
rasterizer that has been written from scratch. It delivers superior performance
while quality is comparable to rasterizers used by AGG and FreeType. The
performance has been optimized by using an innovative approach to index data
that is built during rasterization and scanned during composition. The
rasterizer is robust and excels in rendering complex vector art and text.
