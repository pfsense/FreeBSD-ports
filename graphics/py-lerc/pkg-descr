LERC is an open-source image or raster format which supports rapid encoding and
decoding for any pixel type (not just RGB or Byte). Users set the maximum
compression error per pixel while encoding, so the precision of the original
input image is preserved (within user defined error bounds).

This port is the Python binding for LERC (Limited Error Raster Compression).
