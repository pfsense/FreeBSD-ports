  To make the automatic discovery work, you need to have avahi-daemon running.
  Make sure that

      avahi_daemon_enable="YES"

  is in /etc/rc.conf(.local), and start the avahi-daemon service. Some other
  program, such as Firefox, may also bind to the mDNS port (5353), so make sure
  that avahi-daemon can bind to the port.

  To quickly check if your scanner can be discovered, run

      avahi-browse -r _uscan._tcp

  You should see your scanner listed in the result.
