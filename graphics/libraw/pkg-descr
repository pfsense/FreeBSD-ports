LibRaw is a library for reading RAW files obtained from digital photo
cameras (CRW/CR2, NEF, RAF, DNG, and others).

LibRaw is based on the source codes of the dcraw utility, where part of
drawbacks have already been eliminated and part will be fixed in future.
The users of the library are provided with API to be built into their
software programs.

LibRaw is intended to be used in any software that involves RAW file
processing for a variety of purposes: RAW converters, data analyzers,
panorama stitchers, noise suppressors, etc.
