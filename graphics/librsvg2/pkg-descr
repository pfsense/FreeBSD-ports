The librsvg library is a lightweight library for parsing and rendering
vector-graphic files in SVG format (like the ones made by sodipodi).  It also
includes functions that render anti-aliased fonts using freetype, including
caching of glyphs.  It is used by Nautilus for drawing vector icons and
anti-aliased text.
