extension currently has implementations of the Haversine and Vincenty's formulas
for calculating distances, an initial bearing calculation function, a Helmert
transformation function to transfer between different supported datums,
conversions between polar and Cartesian coordinates, conversions between
Degree/Minute/Seconds and decimal degrees, a method to simplify linear
geometries, as well as a method to calculate intermediate points on a
LineString.
