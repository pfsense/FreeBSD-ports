libglvnd is a vendor-neutral dispatch layer for arbitrating OpenGL API calls
between multiple vendors. It allows multiple drivers from different vendors
to coexist on the same filesystem, and determines which vendor to dispatch
each API call to at runtime.

Both GLX and EGL are supported, in any combination with OpenGL and OpenGL ES.
