This package exists in an effort to bridge the gap between Hyprland
and KDE/Gnome's functionality, as well as allow apps for some extra
neat functionality under Hyprland.

Since wayland-protocols is slow to change (on top of Hyprland not
being allowed to contribute), we have to maintain a set of protocols
Hyprland uses to plumb some things / add some useful features.

Some of the protocols here also do not belong in wayland-protocols, as
they are specific to Hyprland.
