Seven Segment Optical Character Recognition or ssocr for short is a program to
recognize digits of a seven segment display. An image of one row of digits is
used for input and the recognized number is written to the standard output. The
program runs on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X (using Homebrew to install Imlib2), and even
on Windows (using Cygwin). It uses Imlib2 to access image data.
