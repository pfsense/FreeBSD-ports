appleseed currently requires itself to be installed under common prefix:
%%APPHOME%%.  To run CLI or GUI version, execute the following
commands, respectively:

	%%APPHOME%%/bin/appleseed.cli
	%%APPHOME%%/bin/appleseed.studio

Until https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/issues/2520 is resolved,
you might want to create $HOME/shaders -> %%APPHOME%%/shaders
symlink to help it find OSL shaders.
