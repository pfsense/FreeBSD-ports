Rawstudio is an open-source program to read and manipulate RAW images from
digital cameras.  It will convert your RAW files into JPEG, PNG, or TIFF
images which you can then print or send to friends and clients.  You can
also upload photos directly to Picasa, Flickr, and Facebook galleries.

Rawstudio is intended to be the first tool in your image processing chain.
After you have made your overall image adjustments to your image, you can
use an image editing application to further work on your images.  Rawstudio
itself is a highly specialized application for reviewing and processing RAW
images, not a fully featured image editing application.
