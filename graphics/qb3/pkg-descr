QB3: Image/Raster Compression, Fast and Efficient
- Better compression than PNG in most cases
- Lossless compression and decompression rate of 500MB/sec for byte data,
  4GB/sec for 64 bit data
- All integer types, signed and unsigned, 8 to 64bit per value
- Lossless, or lossy by division with a small integer (quanta)
- No significant memory footprint during encoding or decoding
- No external dependencies, very low complexity
