The Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) is an interactive
desktop tool that is used for easy access, manipulation, and
visualization of earth science data. The format of the data may be
either binary, GRIB, NetCDF, or HDF-SDS (Scientific Data Sets).
GrADS has been implemented worldwide on a variety of commonly used
operating systems and is freely distributed over the Internet.
