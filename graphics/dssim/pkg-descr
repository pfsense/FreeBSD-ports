This tool computes (dis)similarity between two or more PNG images
using an algorithm approximating human vision.

Comparison is done in L*a*b* color space (D65 white point, sRGB gamma)
using a multi-scale variant of the SSIM algorithm.

Features:
- Improved algorithm
    - Compares at multiple weighed resolutions, and scaling is done in
      linear-light RGB. It's sensitive to distortions of various sizes
      and blends colors correctly to detect e.g. chroma subsampling errors.
    - Uses L*a*b* color space for the SSIM algorithm. It measures
      brightness and color much better than metrics from average of
      RGB channels.
- Supports alpha channel.
- Supports images with color profiles.
- Takes advantage of multi-core CPUs.
- Can be used as a library in C, Rust, and WASM.
- No OpenCV or MATLAB needed.
