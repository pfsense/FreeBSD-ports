cxxplot is a C++ plotting library meant to be used in science, engineering and
data analysis. The main objectives of the project are:
* Provide syntax that is familiar to scientists and engineers.
* Enable low setup times.
* Be more performant than typical plotting libraries.
* Operate in asynchronous mode. Therefore plot calls and user code can be
  combined and still retain GUI interactivity.
