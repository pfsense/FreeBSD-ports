Processing is an open source programming language and environment
for people who want to program images, animation, and interactions.
It is used by students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists
for learning, prototyping, and production. It is created to teach
fundamentals of computer programming within a visual context and
to serve as a software sketchbook and professional production tool.
Processing is an alternative to proprietary software tools in the
same domain.
