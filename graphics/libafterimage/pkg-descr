libAfterImage is the imaging library implemented for AfterStep X Window
Manager. It has been generalized to be suitable for any application in
need of robust graphics engine.

It provides facilities for loading images from files of different formats,
compressed in memory storage of images, scaling, tinting/shading, flipping
and superimposition of arbitrary number of images over each other. In
addition it allows for linear gradients drawing, and antialiased/smoothed
text drawing using both  FreeType library and X Window fonts.

Primary goals of this library are to achieve exceptional quality of images
and text, making code fast and small at the same time. Additional steps are
taken to compensate for screen colordepth limitation, and different error
diffusion algorithms are used to provide for smooth images even in low
colordepth modes.
