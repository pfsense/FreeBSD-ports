This a thumbnail maker. Thumbnails are smaller versions of the original
image/graphic/picture and are used for preview purposes, where bigger images
can take a long time to load. They are also used in image galleries to
preview a lot of images at a time.

This module also has the capability to add information strips about the
original image. Original image's size (in bytes) and resolution & mime type
can be added to the thumbnail's upper and lower parts. This feature can be
useful for web software (image galleries or forums).

This is a Yet Another type of module. There are several other thumbnail
modules on CPAN, but they simply don't have the features I need, so this
module is written to increase the thumbnail population on CPAN.

The module can raise an exception if something goes wrong. So, you may have
to use an eval block to catch them.
