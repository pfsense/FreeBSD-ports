swfmill is an xml2swf and swf2xml processor with import functionalities.

It's most common use is the generation of asset libraries containing
images (PNG and JPEG), fonts (TTF) or other SWF movies for use with
MTASC-compiled ActionScript, although swfmill can be used to produce
both simple and complex SWF structures.

* built around an XSLT/EXSLT processor (libxslt)
* input and output of the XSLT transformation can be either XML or
  binary SWF
* XSLT commands for importing PNG, JPEG, TTF and SWF, and for mapping
  SWF ID numbers
* built-in "simple dialect" to support library creation and building
  simple SWFs
