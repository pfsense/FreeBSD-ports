Graphite is a project under development within SIL's Non-Roman Script Initiative
and Language Software Development groups to provide rendering capabilities for
complex non-Roman writing systems. The original goal was a system for the
Windows platform; the system has also been ported to Linux. Graphite can be used
to create "smart fonts" capable of displaying writing systems with various
complex behaviors. With respect to the Text Encoding Model, Graphite handles the
"Rendering" aspect of writing system implementation.
