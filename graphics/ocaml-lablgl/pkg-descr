LablGL is an OpenGL interface for Objective Caml. Since it includes
support for the Togl widget, you can comfortably use it with LablTk.

All of the GL and GLU libraries are available. Read a good book
about how to use these. Translating from OpenGL to LablGL is rather
straightforward: there is a LablGL function for each OpenGL one.  For
ease of retrieving, both GL and GLU are cut in smaller modules of
related functions.

Please see ${PREFIX}/share/doc/ocaml/lablgl/README for further information.
