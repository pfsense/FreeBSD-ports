Electricsheep is a distributed screensaver. It realizes the
collective dream of sleeping computers from all over the internet.
When the screen-saver is activated, the screen goes black and an
animated 'sheep' appears. Behind the scenes, the screen-saver
contacts an internet server and joins the parallel computation of
new sheep.
