The experimental drm-devel-kmod port can be enabled for amdgpu (for AMD
GPUs starting with the HD7000 series / Tahiti), radeonkms for older AMD GPUs
or i915kms (for Intel APUs starting with HD3000 / Sandy Bridge, possibly even
older) through kld_list in /etc/rc.conf.

For amdgpu and radeonkms, there have been reports of issues when using UEFI
firmware boot.  You might need to disable the console by adding
hw.syscons.disable=1  to /boot/loader.conf . Please note that this will
disable the console until the graphics driver is loaded.

For amdgpu: kld_list="amdgpu"
For Intel: kld_list="i915kms"
For radeonkms: kld_list="radeonkms"

Please ensure that all users requiring graphics are members of the
"video" group.
