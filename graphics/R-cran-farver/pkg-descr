The encoding of colour can be handled in many different ways, using
different colour spaces. As different colour spaces have different
uses, efficient conversion between these representations are
important. The 'farver' package provides a set of functions that
gives access to very fast colour space conversion and comparisons
implemented in C++, and offers speed improvements over the
'convertColor' function in the 'grDevices' package.
