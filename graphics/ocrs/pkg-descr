ocrs is a Rust library and CLI tool for extracting text from images, also
known as OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

The goal is to create a modern OCR engine that:
- Works well on a wide variety of images (scanned documents, photos containing
  text, screenshots etc.) with zero or much less preprocessing effort compared
  to earlier engines like [Tesseract][tesseract]. This is achieved by using
  machine learning more extensively in the pipeline.
- Is easy to compile and run across a variety of platforms, including
  WebAssembly
- Is trained on open and liberally licensed datasets
- Has a codebase that is easy to understand and modify

Under the hood, the library uses neural network models trained in
PyTorch, which are then exported to ONNX and executed using
the RTen engine.
