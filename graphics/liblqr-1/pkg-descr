This site is about a seam-carving C/C++ library called Liquid
Rescale.

It is a free, open source implementation of the algorithm described
in the paper [1] by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir.

It aims at resizing pictures non uniformly while preserving their
features, i.e. avoiding distortion of the important parts.

The API is intended to be powerful, yet fast and easy to use. It
supports saving and loading of the carving information, real-time
scaling, manual feature selection, customizable progress report and
more.

Included are full documentation (in docbook format) and examples.
