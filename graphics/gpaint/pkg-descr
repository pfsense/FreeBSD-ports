This is gpaint, a small-scale painting program for GNOME, the GNU
Desktop. Gpaint does not attempt to compete with GIMP.  Think of GIMP
is like Photoshop as gpaint is like Windows Paint.

Gpaint is still work in progress and many features are still being
developed. However, gpaint is useable already for small image markups.

A large part of gpaint is derived from xpaint 2.4.9, authored by David
Koblas and later Torsten Martinsen.  Gpaint also uses the gtkscrolframe
widget (taking from eog 0.5) by Federco Mena-Quintero.

Future plans include the implementation of missing features, printing
support, and turning gpaint into a Bonobo component for simple image
editing tasks.
