"jpgtn" is based on "tnpic" by Russell Marks and on "gtnpic" by Willie
Daniel. "tnpic" was originally distributed as a utility with Marks' "zgv"
program. "gtnpic" was an attempt to clean up and expand upon the original
tnpic program and "maybe add some new features along the way." Jpgtn
differs from both "tnpic" and "gtnpic" in purpose. It is *not* an indexer
of image files. It simply creates thumbnails of images stored in JPEG
format.
