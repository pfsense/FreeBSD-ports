The SciPlot Widget is a widget capable of plotting cartesian or polar graphs,
including logarithmic axes in cartesian plots. The widget is subclassed
directly from the Core widget class, which means that it does not depend upon
any other widget set. It may be freely used with Athena, Motif, or the Open
Look/Xview widget sets.

Features provided in the widget include automatic scaling, legend drawing, axis
labeling, PostScript output, multiple plotted lines, color support, user font
specification, dashed lines, symbols drawn at points, logarithmic scales on one
or both axes in cartesian plots, and degrees or radians as angles in polar
plots.
