GeospatIal Distribution DYnamics (GIDDY)

Giddy is an open-source python library for the analysis of dynamics of
longitudinal spatial data. Originating from the spatial dynamics module in PySAL
(Python Spatial Analysis Library), it is under active development for the
inclusion of many newly proposed analytics that consider the role of space in
the evolution of distributions over time and has several new features including
inter- and intra-regional decomposition of mobility association and local
measures of exchange mobility in addition to space-time LISA and spatial markov
methods.
