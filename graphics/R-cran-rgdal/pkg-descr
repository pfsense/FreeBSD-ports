Provides bindings to the 'Geospatial' Data Abstraction Library
('GDAL') (>= 1.11.4) and access to projection/transformation
operations from the 'PROJ' library. Use is made of classes defined
in the 'sp' package. Raster and vector map data can be imported
into R, and raster and vector 'sp' objects exported. The 'GDAL' and
'PROJ' libraries are external to the package, and, when installing
the package from source, must be correctly installed first; it is
important that 'GDAL' < 3 be matched with 'PROJ' < 6. From 'rgdal'
1.5-8, installed with to 'GDAL' >=3, 'PROJ' >=6 and 'sp' >= 1.4,
coordinate reference systems use 'WKT2_2019' strings, not 'PROJ'
strings. 'Windows' and 'macOS' binaries (including 'GDAL', 'PROJ'
and their dependencies) are provided on 'CRAN'.
