libcaca is a graphics library that outputs text instead of pixels,
so that it can work on older video cards or text terminals.  It is
not unlike the famous AAlib library, with the following improvements:
 * Unicode support
 * 2048 available colours (some devices can only handle 16)
 * dithering of colour images
 * advanced text canvas operations (blitting, rotations)
