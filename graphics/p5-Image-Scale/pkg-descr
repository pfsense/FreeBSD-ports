This module implements several resizing algorithms with a focus on low
overhead, speed and minimal features. Algorithms available are:

  GD's copyResampled (floating-point)
  GD's copyResampled fixed-point (useful on embedded devices/NAS devices)
  GraphicsMagick's assortment of resize filters (floating-point)
  GraphicsMagick's Triangle filter in fixed-point

Supported image formats include JPEG, GIF, PNG, and BMP for input, and
JPEG and PNG for output.
