gprof2dot is a Python script to convert the output from many profilers into a
dot graph.

It can:
- read output from:
  - Linux perf
  - Valgrind's callgrind tool
  - oprofile
  - sysprof
  - xperf
  - VTune Amplifier XE
  - Very Sleepy
  - python profilers
  - Java's HPROF
  - prof, gprof
  - DTrace
- prune nodes and edges below a certain threshold;
- use an heuristic to propagate time inside mutually recursive functions;
- use color efficiently to draw attention to hot-spots;
- work on any platform where Python and Graphviz is available, i.e, virtually
  anywhere.
