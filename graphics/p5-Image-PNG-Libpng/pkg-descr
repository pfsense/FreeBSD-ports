Image::PNG::Libpng is a Perl library for accessing the contents of
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) images. Image::PNG::Libpng enables
Perl to use the "libpng" library for reading and writing files in
the PNG format.

Image::PNG::Libpng consists of Perl subroutines which mirror the C
functions in libpng, plus helper subroutines to make it easier to
read and write PNG data in Perl.
