tif22pnm is a command line utility that converts between TIFF sampled images
and PNM images (both directions), using the libtiff library, but not using
NetPBM. tif22pnm is similar to tifftopnm utility in the NetPBM distribution,
but tif22pnm handles a wider range of TIFF files and it is able to output
the alpha channel as a PBM or PGM file. png22pnm, a converter from PNG to
PNM is also bundled into the distribution.
