This module provides a Perl interface to the amazing Graphviz, an open source
graph visualization tool from AT&T.

It is called GraphViz2 so that pre-existing code using (the Perl module)
GraphViz continues to work.

To avoid confusion, when I use GraphViz2 (note the capital V), I'm referring to
this Perl module, and when I use Graphviz (lower-case v) I'm referring to the
underlying tool (which is in fact a set of programs).

This version of GraphViz2 targets Graphviz 2.23.6+.

GraphViz2 1.x is a complete re-write, by Ron Savage, of GraphViz 2.x, which was
written by Leon Brocard. The point of the re-write is to provide access to all
the latest options available to users of Graphviz.

GraphViz2 1.x is not backwards compatible with GraphViz 2.x, despite the
considerable similarity. It was not possible to maintain compatibility while
extending support to all the latest features of Graphviz.

To ensure GraphViz2 is a light-weight module, Hash::FieldHash has been used to
provide getters and setters, rather than Moose.
