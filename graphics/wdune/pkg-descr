wdune is a graphical VRML97/X3D editor, simple NURBS/Superformula 3D
modeller, animation tool and VRML97/X3DV commandline compiler.

It is a low level tool, it can read VRML97 files, display them and let
the user change the scenegraph/fields. Unlike most highlevel tools, it uses
a lightning model based on the VRML97 standard.
