This is a low level console graphics library, originally based on VGAlib 1.2
by Tommy Frandsen.  VGAlib supported a number of standard VGA graphics modes,
as well as high resolution/high color modes found on many popular graphics
adapters.  As of now, support for many more chipsets had been added.

It supports transparent virtual console switching, that is, you can switch
consoles to and from text and graphics mode consoles using Alt-[Function
Key].  Also, SVGAlib corrects most of VGAlib's textmode corruption behavior
by catching SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, SIGILL, and other fatal signals and ensuring
that a program is running in the currently visible virtual console before
setting a graphics mode.
