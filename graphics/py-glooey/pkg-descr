Every game needs a user interface that matches its look and feel. The purpose
of glooey is to help you make such an interface. Towards this end, glooey
provides 7 powerful placement widgets, a label widget, an image widget,
3 different button widgets, a text entry widget, a variety of scroll boxes
and bars, 4 different dialog box widgets, and a variety of other miscellaneous
widgets. The appearance of any widget can be trivially customized, and
glooey comes with built-in fantasy, puzzle, and 8-bit themes to prove it
(and to help you hit the ground running if your game fits one of those genres).

The philosophy behind glooey is that deriving subclasses from a basic set of
widgets with no default style is the most elegant way to control how
widgets look. This approach is flexible because subclasses can customize or
override most aspects of the basic widgets. But it's also surprisingly
succinct and powerful: specifying a style is usually as simple as setting
a class variable, and styles can be easily composed using either inner
classes or previously defined widgets. This philosophy makes glooey easy
to get started with, and powerful enough to support even the most
complicated games.
