Spectra is a Python library that makes color math, color scales, and
color-space conversion easy.

Support for:

    Color scales
    Color ranges
    Color blending
    Brightening/darkening colors
    Saturating/desaturating colors
    Conversion to/from multiple color spaces

Spectra is built on colormath and grapefruit. Spectra is enormously inspired by
chroma.js and d3's scales.
