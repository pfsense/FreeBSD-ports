Image_Graph is a PHP based object oriented graph rendering package. It
provides a simple yet powerful API to allow a user/developer create
versatile graphs, charts and plots.

The current incarnation of Image_Graph is a merger of the former Sourceforge
package, GraPHPite, and the 'old' Image_Graph package from PEAR.
