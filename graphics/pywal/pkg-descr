Pywal is a tool that generates a color palette from the dominant colors
in an image.  It then applies the colors system-wide and on-the-fly in
all of your favourite programs.

There are currently 5 supported color generation backends, each
providing a different palette of colors from each image. You're bound to
find an appealing color-scheme.

Pywal also supports predefined themes and has over 250 themes built-in.
You can also create your own theme files to share with others.

The goal of Pywal was to be as out of the way as possible. It doesn't
modify any of your existing configuration files. Instead it works around
them and provides tools to integrate your system as you see fit.

Terminal emulators and TTYs have their color-schemes updated in
real-time with no delay.  With minimal configuration this functionality
can be extended to almost anything running on your system.
