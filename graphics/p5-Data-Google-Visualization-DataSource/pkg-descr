The Google Visualization API is a nifty bit of kit for generating pretty
pictures from your data. By design it has a fair amount of Google-cruft, such as
non-standard JSON and stuffing configuration options in to a single CGI query
parameter. It's also got somewhat confusing documentation, and some non-obvious
rules for generating certain message classes.

Data::Google::Visualization::DataTable takes care of preparing data for the API,
but this module implements the Google Chart Tools Datasource Protocol, or Google
Visualization API wire protocol, or whatever it is they've decided to call it
this week.
