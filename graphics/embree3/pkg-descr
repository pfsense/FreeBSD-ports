Embree is a collection of high-performance ray tracing kernels developed
at Intel.  The target users of Embree are graphics application engineers
that want to improve the performance of their application by leveraging
the optimized ray tracing kernels of Embree.

These kernels are optimized for photo-realistic rendering on the latest
Intel processors with support for SSE, AVX, AVX2, AVX512, and the 16-wide
Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor vector instructions.

Embree supports applications written with the Intel SPMD Program Compiler
(ISPC, available as `devel/ispc' port) by also providing an ISPC interface
to the core ray tracing algorithms.
