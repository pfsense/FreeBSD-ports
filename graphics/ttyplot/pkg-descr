ttyplot is a realtime plotting utility for terminal with data input from stdin.

It takes data from standard input / UNIX pipeline, most commonly some tool like
ping, snmpget, netstat, ifconfig, sar, vmstat, etc., and plots in text mode on
a terminal in real time.

It supports rate calculation for counters and up to two graphs on a single
display using reverse video for the second line.
