ImageProcessing provides higher-level image processing helpers that are commonly
needed when handling image uploads.

This gem can process images with either ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick or libvips
libraries. ImageMagick is a good default choice, especially if you are migrating
from another gem or library that uses ImageMagick. Libvips is a newer library
that can process images very rapidly (often multiple times faster than
ImageMagick).
