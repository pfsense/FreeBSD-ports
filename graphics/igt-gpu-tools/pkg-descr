IGT GPU Tools is a collection of tools for development and testing of the
DRM drivers. There are many macro-level test suites that get used against
the drivers, including xtest, rendercheck, piglit, and oglconform, but
failures from those can be difficult to track down to kernel changes, and
many require complicated build procedures or specific testing environments
to get useful results. Therefore, IGT GPU Tools includes low-level tools
and tests specifically for development and testing of the DRM Drivers.
