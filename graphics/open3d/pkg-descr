Open3D is an open-source library that supports rapid development of software
that deals with 3D data. The Open3D frontend exposes a set of carefully
selected data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python. The backend
is highly optimized and is set up for parallelization. Open3D was developed
from a clean slate with a small and carefully considered set of dependencies.
It can be set up on different platforms and compiled from source with minimal
effort. The code is clean, consistently styled, and maintained via a clear code
review mechanism. Open3D has been used in a number of published research
projects and is actively deployed in the cloud. We welcome contributions from
the open-source community.
