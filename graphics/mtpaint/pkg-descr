mtPaint is a simple GTK+1/2 painting program designed for creating icons
and pixel based artwork. It can edit indexed palette or 24 bit RGB images
and offers basic painting and palette manipulation tools. It also has
several other more powerful features such as channels, layers and
animation. Due to its simplicity and lack of dependencies it runs well on
GNU/Linux, Windows and older PC hardware.
