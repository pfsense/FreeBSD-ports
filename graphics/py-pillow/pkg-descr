Pillow is the friendly PIL fork by Alex Clark and Contributors. PIL is the
Python Imaging Library by Fredrik Lundh and Contributors. As of 2019, Pillow
development is supported by Tidelift.

The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python
interpreter.

This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal
representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.

The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic
pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image
processing tool.
