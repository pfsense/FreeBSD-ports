This photo gallery software makes web albums of your digital images.
JAlbum aims to be the easiest to use and most powerful tool in this
category - and free!

JAlbum is written after numerous disappointments with existing photo
gallery software. With JAlbum you have full control of the look of
the generated album, not just color theme and basic layout, still
making an album is just a matter of drag and drop + a button click
if you prefer to use one of the many existing looks. JAlbum will
process your images, make index pages and slide show pages and even
upload the final album to the Internet for your friends to see. No
extra software is needed to view the albums, -just your web browser.
Unlike "server side" album scripts, JAlbum albums can be served
from a plain web server without scripting support. You can also
share your albums on CD-ROM.
