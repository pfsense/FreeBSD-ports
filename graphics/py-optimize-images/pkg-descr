Optimize Images is a command-line interface (CLI) utility written in pure Python
to help you reduce the file size of images.

This application is intended to be pure Python, with no special dependencies
besides Pillow, therefore ensuring compatibility with a wide range of systems.

Some aditional features can be added which require the presence of other
third-party packages that are not written in pure Python, but those packages and
the features depending on them should be treated as optional.
