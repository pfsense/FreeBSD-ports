Vulkan-Utility-Libraries provides shared utility code for Vulkan SDK developers.
It includes standardized layer settings and header-only utilities like dispatch
table setup, format helpers, Vulkan struct handling, and enum-to-string helpers.

This repository improves code reuse and reduces maintenance overhead across
multiple Vulkan-related projects.
