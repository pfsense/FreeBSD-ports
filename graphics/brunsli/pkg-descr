Brunsli is a lossless JPEG repacking library.

Brunsli allows for a 22% decrease in file size while allowing the original JPEG
to be recovered byte-by-byte.

It is possible to try how much Brunsli will save on your images on the site
brunsli.dev. Images are transcoded in browser, no data is transmitted or stored.
Codec is powered by WASM technology.
