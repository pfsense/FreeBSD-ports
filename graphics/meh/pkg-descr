meh is a small, simple, super fast image viewer using raw XLib. It is similar
to feh, but faster and simpler.

meh can use ImageMagick’s convert to view almost 200 file formats, though it is
slower for these formats. Built in formats are JPEG, PNG, BMP, and netpbm.

Features:
- Fast
- Tiny
- Fast JPEG, PNG, GIF and BMP support
- Fast netpbm support (.ppm, .pgm, .pbm, .pnm)
- ImageMagick support by calling convert
    - All ImageMagick formats (almost 200)
    - This allows limited support for PDF’s and SVG’s
- Scales images to window size
- Preserves aspect ratio (either via EWMH hints or by padding the window)
- XSHM Support
- Minimal dependencies (Xlib, libjpeg, libpng, giflib)
