A 3D program for creating voxel volumes, a bit similar to Minecraft.

By restricting the volume along a 3D grid, just like pixels do in two
dimensions, voxels make 3D editing as intuitive as drawing in 2D.
Voxel art is used in many video games, and also by artists as a
standalone style.

Make your scene as large as you want.  Goxel uses sparse matrices
internally so there is not restrictions on how big a model can be.

Use layers to separate parts of the scene into independently editable
3D models.

Goxel can export to many formats, including: Magica Voxel, Qubicle,
glTF2, obj, ply, build engine.
