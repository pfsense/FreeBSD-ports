libdmtx - software for reading and writing Data Matrix barcodes

libdmtx is open source software for reading and writing Data Matrix
barcodes on Linux, Unix, OS X, Windows, and certain mobile devices. At
its core libdmtx is a shared library, allowing C/C++ programs to use its
capabilities without restrictions or overhead.

Data Matrix barcodes are two-dimensional symbols that hold a dense
pattern of data with built-in error correction. The Data Matrix
symbology (sometimes casually referred to as "DataMatrix") was invented
and released into the public domain by RVSI Acuity CiMatrix.
