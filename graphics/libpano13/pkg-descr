This is the pano13 library, part of the Panorama Tools by Helmut
Dersch of the University of Applied Sciences Furtwangen.

Also included with the library are:

- PTOptimizer, a command-line tool for optimizing control points.
- panoinfo, a command-line tool for querying the library version.

The panorama tools are mainly used to build panoramic images from a set of
overlapping images. The usability extends beyond "just" building panoramas by
far though. You can, for instance, use them to render an average of multiple
images to broaden the dynamic range of the images or average out noise. You
can also build object movies with them, morph between images and much more.
