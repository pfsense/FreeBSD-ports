ACES Container Reference Implementation

This folder contains a reference implementation for an ACES container
file writer intended to be used with the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES).
The resulting file is compliant with the ACES container specification
(SMPTE S2065-4). However, there are a few things that are not demonstrated by
this reference implementation.

    Stereo channels
    EndOfFileFiller
    Arbitrary attributes and naming validations
    half type attributes
    keycode value validations
