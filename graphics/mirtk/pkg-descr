The MIRTK is a research-focused image processing toolkit, developed at the
BioMedIA research group. It provides a collection of libraries and command-line
tools to assist in processing and analyzing imaging data. The main application
of the MIRTK is in adult and neonatal brain MR image registration as well as the
reconstruction of cortical surface meshes. The modular project organization of
the MIRTK enables the installation of selected modules.
