S2 Geometry Library is a package for manipulating geometric shapes. Unlike many
geometry libraries, S2 is primarily designed to work with spherical geometry,
i.e., shapes drawn on a sphere rather than on a planar 2D map. This makes it
especially suitable for working with geographic data.

This port is the Python binding of S2 Geometry Library.
