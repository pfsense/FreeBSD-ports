NURBS-Python (geomdl) is a pure Python, self-contained, object-oriented
B-Spline and NURBS spline library for Python versions 2.7.x, 3.4.x and later.

NURBS-Python (geomdl) provides convenient data structures and highly
customizable API for rational and non-rational splines along with the
efficient and extensible implementations of the following algorithms:

- Spline evaluation
- Derivative evaluation
- Knot insertion
- Knot removal
- Knot vector refinement
- Degree elevation
- Degree reduction
- Curve and surface fitting via interpolation and least squares approximation

NURBS-Python (geomdl) also provides customizable visualization and animation
options via Matplotlib, Plotly and VTK libraries.
