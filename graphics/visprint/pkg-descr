Visprint makes fractal fingerprint png images based on the contents of any
file. The image will be different for almost every file with even slightly
different contents. Visprint uses the IFS fractal generation process,
pioneered by Michael Barnsley. It is a way to create images which are
self-similar to infinite depths. In other words, the picture is made up of
smaller versions of itself.
