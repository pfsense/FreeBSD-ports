OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible
3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for
developers to produce games and demos utilising 3D hardware. The class library
abstracts all the details of using the underlying system libraries like
Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and other
intuitive classes.
