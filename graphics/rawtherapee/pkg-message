LENSFUN INFORMATION:

This package uses lensfun to correct lens aberrations. In case
your camera or lens seem unsupported, try running
lensfun-update-data - this will download new lensfun databases.

DISK SPACE WARNING:

Note that RawTherapee uses version-dependent cache and configuration
directories.  Please be advised that cache directories can grow large,
so be sure to check all users' $HOME/.cache/RawTherapee* and have them
remove older cache directories.

Also, after configurations have been moved to the new version's
directory, older $HOME/.config/RawTherapee* directories may be removed.
