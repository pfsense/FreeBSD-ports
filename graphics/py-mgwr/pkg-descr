Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR)

mgwr is a Python implementation of multiscale geographically weighted regression
for investigating process spatial heterogeneity and scale. It incorporates the
widely used approach to modeling process spatial heterogeneity - Geographically
Weighted Regression (GWR) as well as the newly proposed approach - Multiscale
GWR (MGWR) which relaxes the assumption that all of the processes being modeled
operate at the same spatial scale. Inferences are available for both approaches.
