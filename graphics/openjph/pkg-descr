Open source implementation of High-throughput JPEG2000 (HTJ2K), also known as
JPH, JPEG2000 Part 15, ISO/IEC 15444-15, and ITU-T T.814. Here, we are
interested in implementing the HTJ2K only, supporting features that are defined
in JPEG2000 Part 1 (for example, for wavelet transform, only reversible 5/3 and
irreversible 9/7 are supported).
