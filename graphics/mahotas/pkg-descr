Mahotas is a computer vision and image processing library for Python.  It
includes many algorithms implemented in C++ for speed while operating in
numpy arrays and with a very clean Python interface.

Notable algorithms:

  - Watershed
  - Convex points calculations
  - Hit & miss thinning
  - Zernike & Haralick, LBP, and TAS features
  - Freeimage-based numpy image loading
  - Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), a form of local features
  - Thresholding
  - Convolution
  - Sobel edge detection
