A color scheme generator. Takes an image (local or online) and grabs
the most dominant colors using kmeans. Also creates bold colors by
adding value to the dominant colors. Finally, outputs the colors
to stdout (one normal and one bold per line, space delimited) and
generates an HTML preview of the color scheme.
