UrbanSim is a platform for building statistical models of cities and regions.
These models help forecast long-range patterns in real estate development,
demographics, and related outcomes, under various policy scenarios.

This urbansim Python library is a core component. It contains tools for
statistical estimation and simulation; domain-specific logic about housing
markets, household relocation, and other processes; and frameworks and utilities
for assembling a model.
