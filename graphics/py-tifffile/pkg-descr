Tifffile is a Python library to
- store numpy arrays in TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) files, and
- read image and metadata from TIFF-like files used in bioimaging.

Image and metadata can be read from TIFF, BigTIFF, OME-TIFF, STK, LSM, SGI,
NIHImage, ImageJ, MicroManager, FluoView, ScanImage, SEQ, GEL, SVS, SCN, SIS,
ZIF (Zoomable Image File Format), QPTIFF (QPI), NDPI, and GeoTIFF files.

Image data can be read as numpy arrays or zarr arrays/groups from strips, tiles,
pages (IFDs), SubIFDs, higher order series, and pyramidal levels.

Numpy arrays can be written to TIFF, BigTIFF, OME-TIFF, and ImageJ hyperstack
compatible files in multi-page, volumetric, pyramidal, memory-mappable, tiled,
predicted, or compressed form.

A subset of the TIFF specification is supported, mainly 8, 16, 32 and 64-bit
integer, 16, 32 and 64-bit float, grayscale and multi-sample images.
Specifically, CCITT and OJPEG compression, chroma subsampling without JPEG
compression, color space transformations, samples with differing types, or IPTC
and XMP metadata are not implemented.
