Satty is a screenshot annotation tool inspired by Swappy and Flameshot.

Satty has been created to provide the following improvements over
existing screenshot annotation tools:

- very simple and easy to understand toolset (like Swappy)
- fullscreen annotation mode and post shot cropping (like Flameshot)
- working on wlroots based compositors (Sway, Hyprland, River, ...)
- minimal, modern looking UI, thanks to GTK and Adwaita
- be a playground for new features (post window selection, post paint editing, ...)
