Chafa is a command-line utility that converts all kinds of images, including
animated GIFs, into sixel or ANSI/Unicode character output that can be displayed
in a terminal.

It is highly configurable, with support for alpha transparency and multiple
color modes and color spaces, combining selectable ranges of Unicode characters
to produce the desired output.

The core functionality is provided by a C library with a public, well-documented
API.
