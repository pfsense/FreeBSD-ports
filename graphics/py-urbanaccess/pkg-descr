UrbanAccess is tool for creating multi-modal graph networks for use in
multi-scale (e.g. address level to the metropolitan level) transit accessibility
analyses with the network analysis tool Pandana. UrbanAccess uses open data from
General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data to represent disparate
operational schedule transit networks and pedestrian OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to
represent the pedestrian network. UrbanAccess provides a generalized,
computationally efficient, and unified accessibility calculation framework by
linking tools for: 1) network data acquisition, validation, and processing; 2)
computing an integrated pedestrian and transit weighted network graph; and 3)
network analysis using Pandana.
