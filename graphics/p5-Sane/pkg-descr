Perl bindings for the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) Project. This module
allows you to access SANE-compatible scanners in a Perlish and
object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory management in
C, yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.

The Sane module allows a Perl developer to use SANE-compatible scanners.
