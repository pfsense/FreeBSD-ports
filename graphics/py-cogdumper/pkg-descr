COG Dumper is a python utility to extract a tile from a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF
(COG) without decompressing the contained data. Tiff data can be hosted locally,
on a web server or S3.

This can be useful for serving compressed tiles from a TIFF without invoking
Rasterio and GDAL. This utility has been tested with Tiff that have JPEG
compression.
