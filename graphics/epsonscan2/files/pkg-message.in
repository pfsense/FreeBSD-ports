This port supports scanners connected using a USB cable.

To access a network scanner and also to access some older USB scanner
models, you must also install the port:
	graphics/epsonscan2-non-free-plugin
which provides the Linux binaries needed to access the scanner.  The kernel
Linux emulation modules and emulators/linux_base-c7 ports are also needed
for the non-free-plugin.

Please read %%PREFIX%%/lib/epsonscan2/Read_me.FreeBSD for further details
of how to configure and use this software.
