The graphics/epsonscan2 scanner driver is the main Epson scanner port.

This port provides the Linux binaries needed to access the scanner over
the network and for some older USB models.  This port requires the kernel
Linux emulation and emulators/linux_base-c7 ports.  Depending on your scanner
model, if you do not need network access, you may not need this port or the
Linux emulator.

Please read %%PREFIX%%/lib/epsonscan2/Read_me.FreeBSD for further details
of how to configure and use this software.

Note that es2intif requires FreeBSD 13.x or 14.x kernel later than 2022/03/05
for operation with scanner models shown with [*] in
%%PREFIX%%/lib/epsonscan2/Read_me.FreeBSD.
