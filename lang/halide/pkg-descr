Halide is a new programming language designed to make it easier to write
high-performance image processing code on modern machines. Its current front
end is embedded in C++. Compiler targets include x86/SSE, ARM v7/NEON, CUDA,
and OpenCL.

Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is embedded in C++.
This means you write C++ code that builds an in-memory representation of a
Halide pipeline using Halide's C++ API. You can then compile this representation
to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run it in the same process.
