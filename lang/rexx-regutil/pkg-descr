RegUtil is an implementation of IBM's RexxUtil for Regina. According to
the author, it is not complete; however, it implements a large number of
the RexxUtil functions, and is very useful.

Note that any scripts which load RegUtil must be run with the 'regina'
command, rather than 'rexx'; the latter does not support the use of
external function packages.
