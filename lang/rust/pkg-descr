Rust is an open-source systems programming language that runs blazingly
fast, prevents almost all crashes, and eliminates data races.
Some of its features:

  - Algebraic data types, type inference
  - Pattern matching and closures
  - Concurrency without data races
  - Guaranteed memory safety
  - Optional garbage collection
  - Zero-cost abstractions
  - Minimal runtime
  - Efficient C bindings
