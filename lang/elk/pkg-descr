Elk is a Scheme interpreter intended to be used as a general, reusable
extension language subsystem for integration into existing and future
applications.  Elk can also be used as a stand-alone implementation of
the Scheme programming language.

One purpose of the Elk project is to end the recent proliferation of
mutually incompatible Lisp-like extension languages.  Instead of
inventing and implementing yet another extension language, application
programmers can integrate Elk into their application to make it
extensible and highly customizable.
