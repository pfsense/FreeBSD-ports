toLua is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of C/C++
code with Lua. Based on a "cleaned" header file, toLua automatically
generates the binding code to access C/C++ features from Lua. Using
Lua-5.0 API and tag method facilities, the current version automatically
maps C/C++ constants, external variables, functions, namespace,
classes, and methods to Lua. It also provides facilities to create
Lua modules.
