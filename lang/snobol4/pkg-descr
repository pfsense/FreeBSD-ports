This is a free port of the original SIL (SNOBOL4 Implementation Language)
macro version of SNOBOL4 (developed at Bell Labs) with the C language as
target.  Includes SPITBOL and BLOCKS extensions.

SNOBOL4, while known primarily as a string language excels at any task
involving symbolic manipulations.  It provides run time typing,
garbage collection, user data types, on the fly compilation.  Its
primary weakness is its simple syntax, and lack of structured
programming constructs.  However some consider the spareness of
SNOBOL4 syntax a strength when compared to some modern agglomerations.
