QScheme is a fast and small implementation of Scheme written in C.
QScheme is easy to interface and should be easy to use as an extension
language.

QScheme currently supports foreign function call and dynamic library. A
perl like regular expression module is provided as example.

QScheme is really fast: benchmarks (still a little old) shows that it is
generaly between 2 and 70 times faster than other scheme interpreters.

Documentation and GTK support has been disabled in this port.
