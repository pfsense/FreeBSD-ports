Cython is a Python compiler that makes writing C extensions for Python as easy
as Python itself. Cython is based on Pyrex, but supports more cutting edge
functionality and optimizations.

Cython translates Python code to C/C++ code, but additionally supports calling C
functions and declaring C types on variables and class attributes. This allows
the compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code.

This makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping external C libraries, and for
fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.
