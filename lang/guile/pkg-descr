GUILE, GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extension,
is a library that implements the Scheme language plus various
convenient facilities. See the lang/guile3 port for more detail.

This is a meta port to the Guile interpreter and provides symbolic
links to bin/guile and bin/guild as a convenience to users. Do not
depend on this port.
