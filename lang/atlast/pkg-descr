ATLAST  is  an  attempt to make software component technology and open
architecture  applications  commonplace  in  the  mainstream  software
market.   It  is  both  a  software  component  which  can  be readily
integrated into existing applications,  providing  them  a  ready-made
macro  language  and  facilities  for user extension and customisation
and, at the same time, it is a foundation upon which new  applications
can be built in an open, component-oriented manner.
