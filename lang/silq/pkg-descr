Silq is a high-level programming language for quantum computing with a strong
static type system.

The compiler is accompanied by a large collection of example files, some of
them implementing solutions to Microsoft's Q# Summer 2018 and Winter 2019
coding contest on Codeforces.

The project web-site provides detailed information on the language and its
concepts and use.
