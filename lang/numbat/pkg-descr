Numbat is a statically typed programming language for scientific computations
with first class support for physical dimensions and units.

Numbat has a static type system where physical dimensions like `Length` and
`Time` act as types.
Definitions of constants and functions can optionally contain type annotations
that will be statically enforced.
If the types are not specified, they will be inferred (`Speed`, `Money` and
`Frequency` in the screenshot).

Numbat is focused on computations with units. Units are therefore treated as
first-class citizens.
