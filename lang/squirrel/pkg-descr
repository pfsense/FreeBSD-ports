Squirrel is a high level imperative/OO programming language, designed
to be a powerful scripting tool that fits in the size, memory bandwidth,
and real-time requirements of applications like games. However Squirrel
offers a wide range of features like dynamic typing, delegation, classes
& inheritance, higher order functions, generators, coroutines, tail
recursion, exception handling, automatic memory management, weak
references, etc.

Squirrel is inspired by languages like Python, Javascript and especially
Lua. The API is very similar and the table code is based on the Lua one.
