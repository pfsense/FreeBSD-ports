Some of the standard commands are provided as separate ports for ease
of upgrading:

	devel/ruby-gems:		gem - RubyGems package manager
	devel/rubygem-irb:		irb - Interactive Ruby
	devel/rubygem-rake:		rake - Ruby Make
	devel/rubygem-rdoc:		rdoc - Ruby Documentation System
	sysutils/rubygem-bundler:	bundler - Tool that manages gem dependencies for ruby applications

And some of the standard libraries are provided as separate ports
since they require extra dependencies:

	databases/rubygem-gdbm:	GDBM module

Install them as occasion demands.
