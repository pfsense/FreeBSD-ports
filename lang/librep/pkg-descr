Librep is a Lisp system for UNIX, needed by Sawfish window manager.
It contains a Lisp interpreter, byte-code compiler and virtual
machine. Applications may use the Lisp interpreter as an extension
language, or it may be used for stand-alone scripts.

The Lisp dialect was originally inspired by Emacs Lisp, but with the
worst features removed. It also borrows many ideas from Scheme.
