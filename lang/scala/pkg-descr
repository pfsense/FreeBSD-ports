Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to express
common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe
way. It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional
languages, enabling Java and other programmers to be more productive.
Code sizes are typically reduced by a factor of two to three when
compared to an equivalent Java application.
