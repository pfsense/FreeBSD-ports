This module aims to provide a nicer syntax and method to catch errors in
Perl, similar to what is found in other languages (such as Java, Python
or C++). The standard method of using eval {}; if ($@) {} is often prone
to subtle bugs, primarily that its far too easy to stomp on the error in
error handlers. And also eval/if isn't the nicest idiom.
