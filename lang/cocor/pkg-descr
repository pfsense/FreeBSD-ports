Coco/R combines the functionality of the well-known UNIX tools lex and yacc,
to form an extremely easy to use compiler generator that generates recursive
descent parsers, their associated scanners, and (in some versions) a driver
program, from attributed grammars (written using EBNF syntax with attributes
and semantic actions) which conform to the restrictions imposed by LL(1)
parsing (rather than LALR parsing, as allowed by yacc). The user has to add
modules for symbol table handling, optimization, and code generation in
order to get a running compiler. Coco/R can also be used to construct other
syntax-based applications that have less of a "compiler" flavour.

Coco/R is available in Oberon, Modula-2, Pascal, Delphi, C, Java and C#
versions.  This port only builds the C/C++ version.
