Futhark is a purely functional data-parallel programming language in the
ML family. It can be compiled to typically very efficient parallel code, running
on either a CPU or GPU. The language is developed at DIKU at the University of
Copenhagen, originally as part of the HIPERFIT centre. It is quite stable and
suitable for practical programming.
