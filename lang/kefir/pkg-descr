Kefir is an independent compiler for the C17/C23 programming language,
developed by Jevgenij Protopopov.  Kefir has been validated with a test
suite of 80 software projects, among which are GNU core- and binutils,
Curl, Nginx, OpenSSL, Perl, Postgresql, Tcl and many others.  The
compiler targets x86_64 architecture and System-V AMD64 ABI, supporting
Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD an OpenBSD.  While the primary priority is
compatibility and compliance, Kefir also features conservative SSA-based
optimization pipeline, debug information generation,
position-independent code, and implements bit-identical bootstrap.
Kefir focuses on C source code translation to assembly, and integrates
with the rest of system toolchain (assembler, linker, standard library)
for other tasks.
