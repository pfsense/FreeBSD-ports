Gleam is a fast, friendly, and functional language for building
type-safe, scalable systems.

The Gleam compiler itself is written in rust.

Gleam uses the BEAM runtime, and using the same actor-based multi-core
concurrency, with zero runtime overhead and full inter-operability with
Erlang, Elixir, and LFE.

It has all the features you'd expect from an ML derived language,
including algebraic data-types, immutable data structures, full type
inference, fast compilation, generics, no nulls nor exceptions, and a
few bonus features such as helpful error messages.
