The Error package provides two interfaces. Firstly Error provides a procedural
interface to exception handling. Secondly Error is a base class for
errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can simply
be recorded.

Errors in the class Error should not be thrown directly, but the user should
throw errors from a sub-class of Error.
