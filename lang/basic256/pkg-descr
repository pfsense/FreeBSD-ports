BASIC-256 is an easy to use version of BASIC designed to teach anybody
(especially middle and high-school students) the basics of computer
programming.

It uses traditional control structures like gosub, for/next, and goto,
which helps kids easily see how program flow-control works. It has a
built-in graphics mode which lets them draw pictures on screen in
minutes, and a set of detailed, easy-to-follow tutorials that
introduce programming concepts through fun exercises.
