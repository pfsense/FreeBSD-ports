CamlIDL is a stub code generator and COM binding for Objective Caml.

CamlIDL comprises two parts:

	* A stub code generator that generates the C stub code required for the
Caml/C interface, based on an MIDL specification. (MIDL stands for Microsoft's
Interface Description Language; it looks like C header files with some extras
annotations, plus a notion of object interfaces that look like C++ classess
without inheritance.)

	* A (currently small) library of functions and tools to import COM
components in Caml applications, and export Caml code as COM components.
