The SIMULA programming language was designed and built by Ole-Johan Dahl
and Kristen Nygaard at the Norwegian Computing Centre (NCC) in Oslo
between 1962 and 1967.1 It was originally designed and implemented as a
language for discrete event simulation, but was later expanded and
reimplemented as a full scale general purpose programming language.

Although SIMULA never became widely used, the language has been highly
influential on modern programming methodology. Among other things SIMULA
introduced important object-oriented programming concepts like classes and
objects, inheritance, and dynamic binding.
