textX is a meta-language for building Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) in
Python. It is inspired by Xtext.

In a nutshell, textX will help you build your textual language in an easy way.
You can invent your own language or build a support for already existing textual
language or file format.

From a single language description (grammar), textX will build a parser and a
meta-model (a.k.a. abstract syntax) for the language. See the docs for the
details.

textX follows the syntax and semantics of Xtext but differs in some places and
is implemented 100% in Python using Arpeggio PEG parser - no grammar
ambiguities, unlimited lookahead, interpreter style of work.
