Yorick is an interpreted programming language for:

  * Scientific simulations or calculations
  * Postprocessing or steering large simulation codes
  * Interactive scientific graphics
  * Reading, writing, and translating large files of numbers

The language features a compact syntax for many common array operations,
so it processes large arrays of numbers very quickly and efficiently.

Superficially, yorick code resembles C code, but yorick variables are
never explicitly declared and have a dynamic scoping similar to many Lisp
dialects.  The yorick language is designed to be typed interactively at a
keyboard, as well as stored in files for later use.

This package includes an emacs-based development environment, which one
can launch by typing M-x yorick in emacs, if installed `yorick.el' have
been loaded into one's ~/.emacs file.
