PRQL is a modern language for transforming data - a simple, powerful, pipelined
SQL replacement. Like SQL, it's readable, explicit and declarative. Unlike SQL,
it forms a logical pipeline of transformations, and supports abstractions such
as variables and functions. It can be used with any database that uses SQL,
since it compiles to SQL.
