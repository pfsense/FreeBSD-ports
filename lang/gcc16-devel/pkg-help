Building this port with LTO_BOOTSTRAP enabled requires significant amounts of
memory and time. Consider disabling LTO_BOOTSTRAP in favor of STANDARD_BOOTSTRAP
in case that is a problem.

Note that disabling bootstrap altogether is possible, but not recommended: some
features (e.g. jit) requires you to choose a bootstrap option to be enabled.
