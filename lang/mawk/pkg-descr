mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK language is
useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and processing, and for
prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. mawk is a new awk meaning it
implements the AWK language as defined in Aho, Kernighan and Weinberger, The
AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley Publishing, 1988 (hereafter referred
to as the AWK book.)  mawk conforms to the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition
of the AWK language which contains a few features not described in the AWK
book, and mawk provides a small number of extensions.
