The Tcl extension module gives access to the Tcl library with functionality and
interface similar to the C functions of Tcl.  In other words, you can:

- Create Tcl interpreters
  The Tcl interpreters so created are Perl objects whose destructors delete the
  interpreters cleanly when appropriate.
- Execute Tcl code in an interpreter
  The code can come from strings, files or Perl filehandles.
- Bind in new Tcl procedures
  The new procedures can be either C code (with addresses presumably obtained
  using dl_open and dl_find_symbol) or Perl subroutines (by name, reference or
  as anonymous subs). The (optional) deleteProc callback in the latter case is
  another perl subroutine which is called when the command is explicitly
  deleted by name or else when the destructor for the interpreter object is
  explicitly or implicitly called.
- Manipulate the result field of a Tcl interpreter
- Set and get values of variables in a Tcl interpreter
- Tie perl variables to variables in a Tcl interpreter
  The variables can be either scalars or hashes.
