  message: <<EOM
%%PKGNAME%% is now installed in %%PREFIX%%/%%COMPILERDIR%%, to use it you
have to put your license into your INTEL_FLEXLM_LICENSE (default:
%%PREFIX%%/%%COMPILERDIR%%/licenses) directory and add
%%PREFIX%%/%%COMPILERDIR%%/bin to your PATH.

WARNING: If you use icc while having linux_devtools installed, icc will
use the wrong includes and therefore will generate non-working binaries!

If you encounter problems with icc please consult the errata at
http://support.intel.com/support/performancetools/c/C_Compiler_Errata.htm
first.

Call for benchmarks: Intel is interested to see some benchmark numbers
which compare gcc with icc. If you have a CPU produced by Intel and are
able to do benchmarks with either your own source or with one of our major
ports (e.g. with a webserver, a mailserver, a database system, an
important graphics suite/program or some important math tool, ...) please
try to spend some time to do a benchmark and send me (%%MAINTAINER%%) the
result. You should include your system specs (CPU: speed/model, RAM:
amount/speed, used disks (if necessary), chipset/mainboard type, ...), the
version of the used software (OS, gcc, icc, ...), non default tuning
options (kernel, sysctl) and the used compiler switches. If you don't use
some 'standard' benchmark (e.g. the official MySQL benchmark, or the
performance test suite of your prefered scripting language), please
include a description about the benchmark too.

Please use FreeBSD as the name of your OS in communications with the
support, the larger the FreeBSD userbase is, more gets done on FreeBSD
specific issues by Intel. And please thank them for the FreeBSD support,
they are already spending some time to improve icc on FreeBSD.
