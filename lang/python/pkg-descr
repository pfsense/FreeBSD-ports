Python is an interpreted object-oriented programming language, and is
often compared to Tcl, Perl or Scheme.
This is a meta port to the Python interpreter and provides symbolic links
to bin/python, bin/pydoc, bin/idle and so on to allow compatibility with
version agnostic python scripts.
Do not depend on this port.
