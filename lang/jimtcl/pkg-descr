Jim is an opensource small-footprint implementation of the Tcl programming
language. It implements a large subset of Tcl and adds new features like
references with garbage collection, closures, built-in Object Oriented
Programming system, Functional Programming commands, first-class arrays and
UTF-8 support. All this with a binary size of about 100-200kB (depending upon
selected options).
