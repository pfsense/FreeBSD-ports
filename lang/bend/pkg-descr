Bend is a massively parallel, high-level programming language.

Unlike low-level alternatives like CUDA and Metal, Bend has the feeling and
features of expressive languages like Python and Haskell, including fast object
allocations, higher-order functions with full closure support, unrestricted
recursion, even continuations. Yet, it runs on massively parallel hardware like
GPUs, with near-linear speedup based on core count, and zero explicit parallel
annotations: no thread spawning, no locks, mutexes, atomics. Bend is powered by
the HVM2 runtime.
