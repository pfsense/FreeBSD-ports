This port is written in ARM32 assembly.  On ARM64 systems, it only runs
on those that support the AArch32 execution state in EL0.  If the port
does not run, check dmesg for a line like

    Processor Features 0 = <AdvSIMD,FP,EL3 32,EL2 32,EL1 32,EL0 32>

If the feature string "EL0 32" does not occur, your processor cannot
run ARM32 binaries and thus will not be able to run this port either.
