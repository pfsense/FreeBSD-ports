Mecrisp Stellaris is an implementation of a standalone native code Forth
for ARM.  It fits into 16 kb of flash and runs with at least 1 kb of
RAM.  You can choose to compile to flash or to RAM, and it generates
native code with folding, inlining of short words and it opcodes common
instructions.  Note that it doesn't need to save any pointers, so it
compiles directly into flash memory without the need for erase cycles.
Although it is in spirit of ANS, there are a few differences: Be
careful!
