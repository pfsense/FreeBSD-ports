QMASM fills a gap in the software ecosystem for D-Wave's adiabatic quantum
computers by shielding the programmer from having to know system-specific
hardware details while still enabling programs to be expressed at a fairly low
level of abstraction. It is therefore analogous to a conventional macro
assembler and can be used in much the same way: as a target either for
programmers who want a great deal of control over the hardware or for compilers
that implement higher-level languages.
