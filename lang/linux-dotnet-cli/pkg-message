Telemetry
---------
The .NET Core tools collect usage data in order to improve your experience.
The data is anonymous and does not include command-line arguments. The data is
collected by Microsoft and shared with the community. You can opt out of
telemetry by setting a DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT environment variable to 1
using your favorite shell. You can read more about .NET Core tools telemetry @

CA Root Certificates for NSS
----------------------------
.NET Core requires NSS CA certificates installed.  The recommended way to
install the certificates is to:

# pkg install ca_root_nss
# ln -s /usr/local/share/certs/ca-root-nss.crt \
    /compat/linux/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

Failed to initialize CoreCLR, HRESULT: 0x8007001F
-------------------------------------------------
.NET core may produce the above error message if the system has exceeded
capacity for wired memory, or is unprivilaged allocations of wired memory is
not permitted.  

To ensure unprivilaged allocation of wired memory is allowed, as root:

# sysctl security.bsd.unprivilaged_mlock=1

To preserve this setting across reboots, append the following to
/etc/sysctl.conf:

security.bsd.unprivilaged_mlock=1

To check the usage and limit of wired memory see the 'vm.stats.vm.v_wire_count'
and 'vm.max_wired' sysctl(8) respectively.  To increase the wired memory
capacity set 'vm.max_wired' to a value greater than 'vm.stats.vm.v_wire_count'.
.NET Core only requires ~128k wired memory per running application.

For example, if one has:

# sysctl vm.stats.vm.v_wire_count
vm.stats.vm.v_wire_count: 1332146
# sysctl vm.max_wired
vm.max_wired: 1331964

then increasing 'vm.max_wired' will enable .NET Core to run:

# sysctl vm.max_wired=1333000
