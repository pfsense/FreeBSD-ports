Munger is a simplified, statically-scoped, interpreted lisp specialized for
writing text processors for 8-bit text.  With Munger the programmer may
write line-by-line filters, if serial access to the text is sufficient, or
the programmer may load text into buffers and have line-oriented random
access to those lines, if that is more convenient.

Munger makes it easy to write simple text editors, shells, utility filters,
CGI scripts, and simple network client and server programs.  Mung (or
munge) is computer jargon for, "to make repeated changes which individually
may be reversible, yet which ultimately result in an unintentional
irreversible destruction of large portions of the original item."  Laugh,
it's a joke.
