Python is an interpreted object-oriented programming language, and is
often compared to Tcl, Perl or Scheme.
This is a meta port to the Python 2.x interpreter and provides symbolic links
to bin/python2, bin/pydoc2, bin/idle2 and so on to allow compatibility with
minor version agnostic python scripts.
Do not depend on this port.
