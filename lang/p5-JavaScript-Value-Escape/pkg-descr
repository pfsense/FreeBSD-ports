There are a lot of XSS, a security hole typically found in web
applications, caused by incorrect (or lack of) JavaScript
escaping.  This module is aimed to provide a secure JavaScript
escaping to avoid XSS with JavaScript values.

The escaping routine JavaScript::Value::Escape provides escapes q!"!,
q!'!, q!&!, q!=!, q!-!, q!+!, q!;!, q!<!, q!>!, q!/!, q!\! and control
characters to JavaScript unicode entities like "\u0026".
