NX is a highly flexible, Tcl-based, object-oriented scripting language. It is a
descendant of XOTcl and was designed based on 10 years of experience with XOTcl
in projects containing several hundred thousand lines of code. While XOTcl was
the first language designed to provide language support for design patterns and
to provide a highly dynamic programming environment, the Next Scripting
Framework (NSF) and NX add to these features support for language-oriented
programming.
