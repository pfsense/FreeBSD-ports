Gherkin is a parser and compiler for the Gherkin language, which is a
business-readable, domain-specific language that lets you describe software's
behavior without detailing how that behavior is implemented.

Gherkin serves two purposes:
* It serves as your project's documentation
* It serves as your project's automated tests

Gherkin is written in the "Given-When-Then" style, which allows developers to
write tests in plain English that stakeholders can understand.

This is the official implementation from the Cucumber team, providing a
reliable and well-maintained parser for BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)
frameworks.
