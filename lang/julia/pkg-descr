Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical
computing environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed
parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function
library. The library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature,
best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number
generation, signal processing, and string processing.
