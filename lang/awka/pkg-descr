Awka is an open-source implementation of the AWK programming language.

Awka is not an interpreter like Gawk, Mawk or Nawk, but instead it converts
the program to ANSI-C, then compiles this using gcc or a native C compiled
to create a binary executable. This means you must have an ANSI C compiler
present on your system for Awka to work.
