Fennel is a programming language that brings together the speed,
simplicity, and reach of Lua with the flexibility of a lisp syntax and
macro system.

- Full Lua compatibility: Easily call any Lua function or library from
  Fennel and vice-versa.

- Zero overhead: Compiled code should be just as or more efficient than
  hand-written Lua.

- Compile-time macros: Ship compiled code with no runtime dependency on
  Fennel.

- Embeddable: Fennel is a one-file library as well as an
  executable. Embed it in other programs to support runtime
  extensibility and interactive development.

Anywhere you can run Lua code, you can run Fennel code.
