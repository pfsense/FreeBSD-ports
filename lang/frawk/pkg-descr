frawk is a small programming language for writing short programs processing
textual data. To a first approximation, it is an implementation of the
AWK language; many common Awk programs produce equivalent output when passed
to frawk. You might be interested in frawk if you want your scripts to handle
escaped CSV/TSV like standard Awk fields, or if you want your scripts to
execute faster.
