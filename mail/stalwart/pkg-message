Note: You must define a fallback-admin manually in the configuration file
at %%ETCDIR%%/config.toml to be able to login the first time.

Edit the configuration for the fallback-admin:

[authentication.fallback-admin]
user = "admin"
secret = "yourplaintextpasswordhere"

The secret will be replaced with a hash if you change the fallback
admin's password in the web admin panel. The secret value can also be a
password hash documented here: https://stalw.art/docs/auth/authentication/password/
