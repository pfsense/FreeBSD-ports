tlsrpt-reporter is a TLSRPT reporting service for SMTP TLS Reporting
as defined in RFC 8460. It receives TLSRPT datagrams from a MTA,
collects them, creates a report in conformance with the TLSRPT
Reporting Schema and finally delivers the report either via SMTP,
indirectly by submitting it to a local MTA which ultimately will be
responsible for delivering the report, or directly via HTTP POST.
