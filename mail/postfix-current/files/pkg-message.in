  message: <<EOM
To use postfix instead of sendmail:
  - clear sendmail queue and stop the sendmail daemons

Run the following commands to enable postfix during startup:
  - sysrc postfix_enable="YES"
  - sysrc sendmail_enable="NONE"

If postfix is *not* already activated in %%MC_PREFIX%%/etc/mail/mailer.conf
  - mv %%MC_PREFIX%%/etc/mail/mailer.conf %%MC_PREFIX%%/etc/mail/mailer.conf.old
  - install -m 0644 %%DATADIR%%/mailer.conf.postfix %%MC_PREFIX%%/etc/mail/mailer.conf

Disable sendmail(8) specific tasks,
add the following lines to /etc/periodic.conf(.local):
  daily_clean_hoststat_enable="NO"
  daily_status_mail_rejects_enable="NO"
  daily_status_include_submit_mailq="NO"
  daily_submit_queuerun="NO"

If you are using SASL, you need to make sure that postfix has access to read
the sasldb file.  This is accomplished by adding postfix to group mail and
making the %%PREFIX%%/etc/sasldb* file(s) readable by group mail (this should
be the default for new installs).

If you are upgrading from prior postfix version, please see the README

Incompatible change with snapshot 20200920
==========================================
Internal protocols have changed. You need to "postfix stop" before
updating, or before backing out to an earlier release, otherwise
long-running daemons (pickup, qmgr, verify, tlsproxy, postscreen)
may fail to communicate with the rest of Postfix (warnings, timeouts).

The purpose of this change is to produce better error messages, for
example, when someone configures the discard daemon as a bounce
service in master.cf, or vice versa.

This change will break third-party code that implements a
Postfix-internal protocol such as qpsmtpd. Programs that depend on
Postfix internal details are not supported.
