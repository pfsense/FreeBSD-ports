ezmlm-idx has been installed successfully.

However, before you can use the programs, you should copy the
"ezmlmglrc.sample", "ezmlmrc.sample" and "ezmlmsubrc.sample" files
in %%PREFIX%%/etc/ezmlm to "ezmlmglrc", "ezmlmrc" and "ezmlmsubrc"
respectively.

Usually, you do not need to edit these files, but be sure to check
carefully.

If you have enabled the database extensions, you need to create an
ezmlm database. See section 5 in %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/ezmlm-idx/FAQ
for further instructions.
