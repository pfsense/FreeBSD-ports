Sendmail implements a general purpose internetwork mail routing facility
under the UNIX operating system.  It is not tied to any one transport
protocol - its function may be likened to a crossbar switch, relaying
messages from one domain into another.  In the process, it can do a limited
amount of message header editing to put the message into a format that is
appropriate for the receiving domain.  All of this is done under the
control of a configuration file.
