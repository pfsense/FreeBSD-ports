How to start

+ For existing `mewest` user, backup and/or delete the database
  (`~/Mail/casket`)

  - Since "mailestd" can work with the old database, so OK to skip deleting
    `~/Mail/casket`, but remark that `V` will not work against the mails
    which are indexed by `mewest`.   To make `V` work against them, delete
    the database in advance.

+ Add the below line to `.mew.el` to let Mew use "Hyper Estrairer" for
  search.

      ((setq mew-search-method 'est)

+ Add the below lines to `~/.emacs` use use the "mailest" instead of
  existing "mewest".

      (defvar mew-prog-est        "mew-mailest")
      (defvar mew-prog-est-update "mew-mailest")
      (defvar mew-prog-cmew       "cmew-mailest")
      (defvar mew-prog-smew       "smew-mailest")
      (defvar mew-id-db-file      ".mailest.sock")

+ Try `km`, `kM`, `k/`, `k?`, `V` in Mew.  See
  http://mew.org/en/info/release/mew_6.html#dbsearch for search commands
  in Mew.
