Gnarwl is an email autoresponder.

Unlike the original vacation(1) program, gnarwl is based on LDAP.
Traditionally you had to give every user, who wanted to use autoreply
facilities full fledged system accounts (trusting them to set their
forwarding up properly, cursing when they didn't).

With gnarwl this is history. User information is now stored in LDAP.
Thats right, no more messing around with system accounts or homedirs for
users who just want their email working, but don't care to fuss around
with shell commands.
