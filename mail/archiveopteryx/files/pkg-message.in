Please install PostgreSQL client/server (databases/postgresqlXX-client
and databases/postgresqlXX-server) separately. The latest 9.x version
is recommended but any version newer than 9.1.0 should work.

To set up the database and generate a configuration file, run
%%PREFIX%%/libexec/aox/installer as root. The new configuration file will be in
%%ETCDIR%%/archiveopteryx.conf.

%%PREFIX%%/libexec/aox/installer -n shows what it would do, without making any
changes. (If you are just upgrading from an older version,
%%PREFIX%%/bin/aox upgrade schema may be enough.
%%PREFIX%%/bin/aox upgrade schema -n shows what it would do, without making
any changes.)

The logfile is syslog/mail by default.

If you have any problems, the FAQ is at
http://www.archiveopteryx.org/faq/ and you can always ask
info@aox.org for help.
