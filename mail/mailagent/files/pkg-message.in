In order to make building of this port non-interactive, the build-time
manual configuration of FQDN and the organization name had been removed.

Now you need to specify your domain's FQDN properly in ~/.mailagent file.

Please run "mailagent -I" to make sure your ~/.mailagent is up-to-date,
and set "domain" and "hidenet" configuration options appropriately.
Please consult mailagent(1) for more details.

This package is configured to read %%ORGFILE%%
file to retrieve the name of your organization.  An empty file had been
installed to suppress warning messages.  Please modify as necessary.
