This is a plugin for the Roundcube webmailer to access CardDAV servers like
owncloud, davical, a Google addressbook or a davmail server.  RCMCardDAV
supports autodiscovery of your addressbook url via well-known URLs so you can
just point it to your servers base url.

This port comes with Composer dependencies vendored in.
