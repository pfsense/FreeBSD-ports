Mail::Audit was inspired by Tom Christiansen's audit_mail
and deliverlib programs. It allows a piece of email to be logged,
examined, accepted into a mailbox, filtered, resent elsewhere,
rejected, replied to, and so on. It's designed to allow you to
easily create filter programs to stick in a .forward file or similar.

Mail::Audit groks MIME; when appropriate, it subclasses MIME::Entity.
Read the MIME::Tools man page for details.
