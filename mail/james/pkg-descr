The Apache Java Enterprise Mail Server (a.k.a. Apache James) is a 100% pure
Java SMTP and POP3 Mail server and NNTP News server. We have designed James
to be a complete and portable enterprise mail engine solution based on
currently available open protocols.

James is also a mail application platform. We have developed a Java API to
let you write Java code to process emails that we call the mailet API. A
mailet can generate an automatic reply, update a database, prevent spam,
build a message archive, or whatever you can imagine. A matcher determines
whether your mailet should process an email in the server. The James project
hosts the Mailet API, and James provides an implementation of this mail appli
-cation platform API.

James is based upon the Apache Avalon application framework, formerly a
product of the Apache Avalon project.
