Mail::Verp encodes the address of an email recipient into the envelope sender
address so that a bounce can be more easily handled even if the original
recipient is forwarding their mail to another address and the remote Mail
Transport Agents send back unhelpful bounce messages. The module must also be
used to decode bounce recipient addresses.
