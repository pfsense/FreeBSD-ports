dot-forward reads sendmail's .forward files under qmail.
You can run it in the qmail startup script to support all
your existing .forward files automatically.
Individual users can switch to the .qmail mechanism at their leisure.

dot-forward supports forwarding, program deliveries, and comments.
It does not support file deliveries or :include:.
(However, it recognizes file delivery attempts,
and defers delivery to give you a chance to set up a .qmail file.)
