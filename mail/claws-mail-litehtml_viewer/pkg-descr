Viewer plugin for HTML emails, using the litehtml library.

litehtml is lightweight HTML/CSS rendering engine. The main goal of the
litehtml library is to give the developers the easy way to show the HTML
pages in theirs applications. The popular HTML engines like WebKit are
too complicated for some tasks. For example, it may be too cumbersome
to use WebKit to show some tooltips or pages in HTML format.
