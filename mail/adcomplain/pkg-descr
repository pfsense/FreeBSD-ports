Composes and mails a complaint about inappropriate commercial use of
usenet/e-mail.  Sends complaint his/her provider by default, but
destination is configurable.  Can be used with as few as three keystrokes.

A third-party forwarding service called Abuse.net is used for
complaints to the offender's provider.  This ensures that the best
known complaint address is used.  The first time you use Abuse.net,
you will receive a message asking you to register.  See www.abuse.net.

This was created in the belief that a single, concise message is the
most appropriate way to complain. Mail bombing (e-mailing megabytes
of useless data) and public flaming (replying on usenet, causing your
complaint to be duplicated on every machine in the network) are
discouraged.
