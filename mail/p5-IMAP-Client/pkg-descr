This module was created as a low-level inteface to any IMAP server. It
was built to be a 'clear box' solution to working with an IMAP
environment. The idea is that anything an IMAP client should be able
to do, and any information available via the IMAP specs, should be
available to a client interface and user. This way, the full strength
of the IMAP protocol and data can be utilized, ideally in the most
network-efficient mannger possible, rather than being contrained only
to a subset of commands or data-limited responses. If the server says
it, the client should be able to see it.

This module also takes steps to be able to handle anticipated
situations for the user rather than forcing a per-implementation
behavior for such expected events, such as referrals. IMAP::Client
will fully support referrals, and will transparently handle them for
whatever command is issued to them (so long as the referral s for
anonymous or the same user with the same password - a new user or
different password would require a new username/password to be
obtained. As of 0.01, this is not supported, however the framework is
down.
