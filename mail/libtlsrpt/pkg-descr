The libtlsrpt project provides a low-level C Library which implements
functions that help generate TLSRPT datagrams. Included into a MTA it
assists the MTA in collecting and sending these datagrams to a TLSRPT
reporting service where they can be collected, summarized and finally
sent to a mail platform that requests TLSRPT reports as defined in in
RFC 8460.
