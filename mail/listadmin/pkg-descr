listadmin is a command-line alternative to Mailman's Web interface
for administering mailing lists. It allows you to inspect messages
or subscription requests, approve or discard them manually, or
discard messages automatically when certain conditions are true.
listadmin can also be configured to run out of cron to do routine cleaning.
