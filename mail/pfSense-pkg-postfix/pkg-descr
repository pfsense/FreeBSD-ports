Postfix mail forwarder acts as a relay server for your domain.
It can do first and second line antispam combat before sending incoming mail to
local mail servers.
Postfix can also detect zombies, check RBLs, SPF, search LDAP for valid 
recipients and use third
part antispam engines like policyd and mailscanner for better antispam solution.
