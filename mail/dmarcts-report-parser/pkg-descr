A Perl based tool to parse DMARC reports, based on John Levine's rddmarc,
but extended by the following features:

    Allow to read messages from an IMAP server and not only from
    the local filesystem.

    Store much more XML values into the database (for example the
    missing SPF and DKIM results from the policy_evaluated section)
    and also the entire XML for later reference.

    Supports MySQL and PostgreSQL.

    Needed database tables and columns are created automatically,
    user only needs to provide a database. The database schema is
    compatible to the one used by rddmarc, but extends it by
    additional fields.  Users can switch from rddmarc to
    dmarcts-report-parser without having to do any changes to the
    database by themselves.
