This plugin enables the scanning of incoming mail received from a POP, IMAP,
or LOCAL account using Bogofilter. It can optionally delete mail identified
as spam or save it to a designated folder. Bogofilter is a pure Bayesian
filter, therefore it has better speed performance than SpamAssassin but might
catch less spam.
