  message: <<EOM
    A sample configuration file has been installed in %%PREFIX%%/etc/mail
    directory. Copy and edit it to suit your needs before launching
    scam-backscatter milter.

    Add the following lines to your /etc/mail/<your_host>.mc configuration.

    define(`confMILTER_MACROS_ENVRCPT', `{rcpt_mailer}, {rcpt_host}, {rcpt_addr}'')dnl
    INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`scam-back', `S=unix:/var/scam-back/scam-back.sock, F=T, T=S:240s;R:240s;E:5m')dnl

    If you are already using another milter, you might have
    confMILTER_MACROS_ENVRCPT already defined. In that case you
    should ensure that it includes the macros listed above (and add
    any missing ones).

    To run scam-backscatter from startup, add scambackscatter_enable="YES"
    in your /etc/rc.conf or your /etc/rc.conf.local

    See %%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL for configuration details.
