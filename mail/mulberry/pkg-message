This is a fully-functional version.  Mulberry is now freeware.
Support is through the community.  If you need support, you
can start here - http://www.mulberrymail.com/support.shtml

This port installs a url.helper file in %%PREFIX%%/lib and a mailcap
file in %%PREFIX%%/etc.  These files tell Mulberry how to handle links
and attachments (respectively) in email.  They assume that you are
using Firefox, KDE, openoffice and acroread.  If you want to override
their values, copy them to .url.helpers and .mailcap in your home
directory and then edit them appropriately.
