When the GPG backend is used the encrypted credentials now are stored
in the $XDG_STATE_HOME/oama directory. If the XDG_STATE_HOME environment
variable is not set then it defaults to $HOME/.local/state.

That is a breaking change! If you use the GPG backend you need to manually
move your credential ~/.local/var/oama/*.oama files into the new directory.
