tmpmail is a command line utility that allows you to create a temporary
email address and receive emails to the temporary email address. It uses
1secmail's API to receive emails.

By default w3m is used to render the HTML emails on the terminal. But if
you prefer another text based web browser or would rather view the email
in a GUI web browser such as Firefox, simply use the --browser argument
followed by the command needed to launch the web browser of your choice.
