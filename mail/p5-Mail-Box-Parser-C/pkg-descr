The Mail::Box::Parser::C implements parsing of messages in ANSI C, using
Perl's XS extension facility.

This is an optional module for MailBox, and will (once installed)
automatically be used by MailBox to parse e-mail message content when
the message is supplied as file-handle.  In all other cases, MailBox
will use Mail::Box::Parser::Perl.
