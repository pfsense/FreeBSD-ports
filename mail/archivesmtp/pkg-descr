ArchiveSMTP is a mail archiver designed to be run on an SMTP mail server. It
uses rule-based matching to collect and store mail passing through an MTA to
specific locations in mbox format. Adding headers and piping output to other
programs is also supported. The libmilter interface is used and must be
supported by the MTA for ArchiveSMTP to work.
