Mail::DeliveryStatus::BounceParser analyzes RFC822 bounce messages and
returns a structured description of the addresses that bounced and the
reason they bounced; it also returns information about the original
returned message including the Message-ID. It works best with RFC1892
delivery reports, but will gamely attempt to understand any bounce
message no matter what MTA generated it.
