libSieve provides a library to interpret Sieve scripts, and to execute
those scripts over a given set of messages. The return codes from the
libSieve functions let your program know how to handle the message, and
then it's up to you to make it so. libSieve makes no attempt to have
knowledge of how SMTP, IMAP, or anything else work; just how to parse
and deal with a buffer full of emails. The rest is up to you!
