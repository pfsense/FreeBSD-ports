Quick Howto

Create a new feed database:
> r2e new you@example.com

Edit $HOME/.config/rss2email.cfg if you so desire. Unless you've installed
a local sendmail-equivalent MTA, you'll need to edit the SMTP options.

Your local database is stored in $HOME/.local/share/rss2email.json

Subscribe to some feeds:
> r2e add freebsd-news http://www.freebsd.org/news/rss.xml

Avoid the "first run flood" of all existing posts from the feed:
> r2e run --no-send

Run it through cron. Feel free to increase or decrease the interval.
0 */4 * * * %%PREFIX%%/r2e run

There is only output if there's an error (which you probably want emailed to you
from cron anyway).
