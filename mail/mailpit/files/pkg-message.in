To run mailpit server on startup, add mailpit_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf.

The SMTP server listens to 127.0.0.1:1025 by default while the web UI can
be reached at http://127.0.0.1:8025/

Custom arguments can be passed to mailpit via the mailpit_args variable.

To change this look at the rc.conf variables in %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/mailpit.
