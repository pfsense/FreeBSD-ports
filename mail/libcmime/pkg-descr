libcmime is a lightweight mime library, written in C. It attempts to
be a general library for parsing and creating mime email messages and
is designed to provide an easy to use and easy to integrate interface
for developers. libcmime is a pretty fresh project so the library is
still in beta state and there will be early and frequent releases.
