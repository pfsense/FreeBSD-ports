This module can be used to convert between two of the LMAP (Lightweight
MTA Authentication Protocol) formats currently being proposed:

  CID = Microsoft's Caller-ID
  SPF = Sender Policy Framework

It will convert an XML-fragment as proposed by CID to a record that can
be added to DNS as proposed by SPF.
