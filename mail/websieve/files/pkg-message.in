  message: <<EOM
Websieve has been installed in %%WWWDIR%%

However, before you can use the program, you should copy the file
"websieve.conf.sample" in %%PREFIX%%/etc/websieve to "websieve.conf"
edit it to suit your needs. Use "openssl rand -base64 39" to create
a new secret key.  You will need to add a section like the following to
your Apache configuration:

    ScriptAlias /websieve "%%WWWDIR%%/"

    <Directory "%%WWWDIR%%">
        Options ExecCGI
        AllowOverride none

        require ip 127.0.0.1
	require host .example.com
    </Directory>
