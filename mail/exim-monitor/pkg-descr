The Exim monitor (eximon) is a graphical user interface for the Exim
mail transfer agent for Unix systems.  Eximon is distributed as part
of the standard Exim distribution, but its dependency on XFree86
annoys many administrators.

For this reason, it is available as its own package to allow
administrators to easily install Exim without installing XFree86.
