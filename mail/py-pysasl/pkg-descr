pysasl is a Pure Python SASL client and server library. The design of the
library is intended to be agnostic of the protocol or network library.

The library currently offers PLAIN, LOGIN, and CRAM-MD5 mechanisms by
default. The EXTERNAL and XOAUTH2 mechanisms are also available for
special circumstances.
