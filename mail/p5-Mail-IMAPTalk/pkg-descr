This module communicates with an IMAP server. Each IMAP server command is mapped
to a method of this object. Although other IMAP modules exist on CPAN, this has
several advantages over other modules:
- It parses the more complex IMAP structures like envelopes and body structures
  into nice Perl data structures.
- It correctly supports atoms, quoted strings and literals at any point. Some
  parsers in other modules aren't fully IMAP compatiable and may break at odd
  times with certain messages on some servers.
- It allows large return values (eg. attachments on a message) to be read
  directly into a file, rather than into memory.
- It includes some helper functions to find the actual text/plain or text/html
  part of a message out of a complex MIME structure. It also can find a list of
  attachements, and CID links for HTML messages with attached images.
- It supports decoding of MIME headers to Perl utf-8 strings automatically, so
  you don't have to deal with MIME encoded headers (enabled optionally).

While the IMAP protocol does allow for asynchronous running of commands, this
module is designed to be used in a synchronous manner. That is, you issue a
command by calling a method, and the command will block until the appropriate
response is returned. The method will then return the parsed results from the
given command.
