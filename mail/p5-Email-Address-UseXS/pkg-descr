To use, simply add use Email::Address::UseXS; in your code before anything that
tries to load in Email::Address.

use Email::Address::UseXS;
print Email::Address->parse('user@example.com');

Email::Address is dangerous, badly-formed input can cause very slow regex
expressions (taking minutes or more to run).
