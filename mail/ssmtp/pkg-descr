A secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to
your mail hub. It does not include a mail spool to poke around in,
and no daemons running in the background. Mail is simply forwarded
to the configured mailhost. Extremely easy configuration.

WARNING: the above is all it does; it does not receive mail, expand
aliases or manage a queue. That belongs on a mail hub with a system
administrator.
