MailTools is a collection of Perl modules for dealing with Internet
e-mail messages.

The modules included can perform a wide range of tasks, including
parsing e-mail addresses, parsing mailcap files, manipulating
message header fields and bodies, sending messages via SMTP or the
Unix mail and sendmail commands, reading mbox mail boxes, and
message filtering through Perl subroutines.
