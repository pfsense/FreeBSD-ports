Maintain a folder which has its messages stored on a remote server. The
communication between the client application and the server is implemented using
the IMAP4 protocol. This class uses Mail::Transport::IMAP4 to hide the transport
of information, and focusses solely on the correct handling of messages within a
IMAP4 folder. More than one IMAP4 folder can be handled by one single IMAP4
connection.
