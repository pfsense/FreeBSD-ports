 This file contains descriptions of new features that have been added to Exim.
 Before a formal release, there may be quite a lot of detail so that people can
 test from the snapshots or the Git before the documentation is updated. Once
 the documentation is updated, this file is reduced to a short list.
 
+Version 4.95
+------------
+
+ 1. The fast-ramp two phase queue run support, previously experimental, is
+    now supported by default.
+
+ 2. The native SRS support, previously experimental, is now supported. It is
+    not built unless specified in the Local/Makefile.
+
+ 3. TLS resumption support, previously experimental, is now supported and
+    included in default builds.
+
+ 4. Single-key LMDB lookups, previously experimental, are now supported.
+    The support is not built unless specified in the Local/Makefile.
+
+ 5. Option "message_linelength_limit" on the smtp transport to enforce (by
+    default) the RFC 998 character limit.
+
+ 6. An option to ignore the cache on a lookup.
+
+ 7. Quota checking during reception (i.e. at SMTP time) for appendfile-
+    transport-managed quotas.
+
+ 8. Sqlite lookups accept a "file=<path>" option to specify a per-operation
+    db file, replacing the previous prefix to the SQL string (which had
+    issues when the SQL used tainted values).
+
+ 9. Lsearch lookups accept a "ret=full" option, to return both the portion
+    of the line matching the key, and the remainder.
+
+10. A command-line option to have a daemon not create a notifier socket.
+
+11. Faster TLS startup.  When various configuration options contain no
+    expandable elements, the information can be preloaded and cached rather
+    than the provious behaviour of always loading at startup time for every
+    connection.  This helps particularly for the CA bundle.
+
+12. Proxy Protocol Timeout is configurable via "proxy_protocol_timeout"
+    main config option.
+
+13. Option "smtp_accept_msx_per_connection" is now expanded.
+
+13. A main config option "allow_insecure_tainted_data" allows to turn
+    taint errors into warnings.
+
 Version 4.94
 ------------
 
  1. EXPERIMENTAL_SRS_NATIVE optional build feature.  See the experimental.spec
     file.

 Whether a string is expanded depends upon the context. Usually this is solely
 dependent upon the option for which a value is sought; in this documentation,
 options for which string expansion is performed are marked with * after the
 data type. ACL rules always expand strings. A couple of expansion conditions do
 not expand some of the brace-delimited branches, for security reasons, and

+option allow_insecure_tainted_data can be used as mitigation during
+uprades to more secure configurations.
+
+Common ways of obtaining untainted equivalents of variables with tainted
+values come down to using the tainted value as a lookup key in a trusted
+database.  This database could be the filesystem structure, or the
+password file, or accessed via a DBMS.  Specific methods are indexed
+under "de-tainting".

+The handling of tainted data may break older (pre 4.94) configurations.
+Setting this option to "true" turns taint errors (which result in a temporary
+message rejection) into warnings. This option is meant as mitigation only
+and deprecated already today. Future releases of Exim may ignore it.
+The taint log selector can be used to suppress even the warnings.
