The following documentation has been installed:

  man exim                              -> Exim options (command line)
  %%DOCSDIR%%/spec.txt    -> Exim Specification (User Guide)
  %%DOCSDIR%%/filter.txt  -> Exim Filter Specification (for end-users)

Postscript, PDF, HTML and texinfo versions of these documents can be
installed via one of the mail/exim-doc-* ports.

An online version as well as a comprehensive FAQ and a mailing list
archive is available at:

  http://www.exim.org/

Descriptions of new features not available it the manual, and a listing
of all changes, including bug fixes are documented in:

  %%DOCSDIR%%/NewStuff
  %%DOCSDIR%%/ChangeLog

To use Exim instead of sendmail on startup:

*) Clear the sendmail queue and stop the sendmail daemon.
*) Adjust mailer.conf(5) as appropriate.
*) Set the 'sendmail_enable' rc.conf(5) variable to 'NONE'.
*) Set the 'daily_status_include_submit_mailq' and
   'daily_clean_hoststat_enable' periodic.conf(5)
   variables to 'NO'.
*) Consider setting 'daily_queuerun_enable' and
   'daily_submit_queuerun' to "NO" in periodic.conf(5),
   if you intend to manage queue runners / deliveries closely.
*) Set the 'exim_enable' rc.conf(5) variable to 'YES'.
*) Start exim with '%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/exim start'.

You may also want to configure newsyslog(8) to rotate Exim log files:

%%LOGDIR%%/mainlog	mailnull:mail 640 7 * @T00 ZN
%%LOGDIR%%/rejectlog	mailnull:mail 640 7 * @T00 ZN

Additional scripts to help upgrading are installed in:
