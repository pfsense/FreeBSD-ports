libESMTP is an SMTP client which manages submission of electronic mail via a
preconfigured Mail Transport Agent (MTA) such as Exim or Postfix.

libESMTP relieves the developer of the need to handle the complexity of
negotiating the SMTP protocol by providing a simple API. Additionally libESMTP
transparently handles many SMTP extensions including authentication.
