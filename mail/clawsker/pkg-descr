Clawsker is an applet to edit Claws Mail's hidden preferences.

Claws Mail has a high number of configurable options and, in order to keep
the binary small and fast, some of these preferences which are not widely
used are not provided with a graphical interface for inspection and/or
modification.

Users wanting to edit such preferences had to face editing the configuration
text files directly, now it is possible with a convenient GTK2 interface using
Clawsker.

Other features:

    * Handling of all hidden preferences
    * Fully internationalized interface using gettext
    * Detection of running Claws Mail
    * Support for alternate configuration directories
