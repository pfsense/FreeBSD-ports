qmailmrtg7 utilizes qmail and tcpserver/multilog's
extensive logging capabilities to create mrtg graphs.
It efficiently processes the logs (large sites with
historical logs of over 100MB can be processed in a few seconds).

For qmail it graphs remote/local delivery concurrency,
queue size, messages process, bytes transferred,
and success/failure delivery status.
For POP and SMTP it graphs total connections and concurrency.
