Change SQL Password allows users to change their passwords when they are stored
in a SQL database. Supports both crypted (MD5, SASL, UNIX) and plaintext
passwords as well as allowing the administrator to force password changes. If
you have SSL support in your web server, you may also force the connection to
SSL when the user is changing her password.
