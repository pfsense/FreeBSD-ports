pyzmail is a high level mail library for Python 2.x & 3.x. It provides functions
and classes that help to parse, compose and send emails. pyzmail exists because
their is no reasons that handling mails with Python would be more difficult than
with Outlook or Thunderbird. pyzmail hides the difficulties of managing the MIME
structure and of the encoding/decoding for internationalized emails.
