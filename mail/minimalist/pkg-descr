Minimalist is a Minimalistic Mailing List manager. It is fast, extremely easy
to setup and support. It is written in Perl and full tested on FreeBSD and
Linux, where it works pretty well. However there aren't causes not to use
Minimalist on any other Unix system, because it doesn't use any
system-dependent features.

Minimalist has these features:

 . subscribing/unsubscribing users by request
 . several levels of security
 . additional services such as information about list, archiving lists,
   information about users of list and so on.
 . support for read-only/closed/mandatory lists
 . support for Blacklist
 . logging activity

Minimalist has also a notion of 'trusted users'. They have full rights to
subscribe/unsubscribe other users; get any information related to lists and
users.
