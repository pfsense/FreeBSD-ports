you will need to configure the sh.cf file with your own
DQS key.   

Follow the instructions at:
https://www.spamhaustech.com/dqs/
to get a key, then go to:
https://portal.spamhaustech.com/manuals/dqs/
and note the DQS key under section "1.0 Datafeed Query Service".

Once you have it, run the following as root:

cd %%PREFIX%%/etc/mail/spamassassin
sed -e 's/your_DQS_key/<your key from above>/g' sh.cf.sample >sh.cf

if the HBL option is selected, issue the following as well:
sed -e 's/your_DQS_key/<your key from above>/g' sh_hbl.cf.sample >sh_hbl.cf

(for more information on HBL, see %%DOCSDIR%%/README.md)

then restart spamassassin.
