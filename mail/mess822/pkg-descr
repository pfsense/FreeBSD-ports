mess822 is a library for parsing Internet mail messages. The mess822
package contains several applications that work with qmail:
   * ofmipd rewrites messages from dumb clients. It supports a database
     of recognized senders and From lines, using cdb for fast lookups.
   * new-inject is an experimental new version of qmail-inject. It
     includes a flexible user-controlled hostname rewriting mechanism.
   * iftocc can be used in .qmail files. It checks whether a known
     address is listed in To or Cc.
   * 822header, 822field, 822date, and 822received extract various
     pieces of information from a mail message.
   * 822print converts a message into an easier-to-read format.

mess822 supports the full complexity of RFC 822 address lists, including
address groups, source routes, spaces around dots, etc. It also supports
common RFC 822 extensions: backslashes in atoms, dots in phrases,
addresses without host names, etc. It extracts each address as an
easy-to-use string, with a separate string for the accompanying comment.

mess822 converts RFC 822 dates into libtai's struct caltime format. It
supports numeric time zones, the standard old-fashioned time zones, and
many nonstandard time zones.
