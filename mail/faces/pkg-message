NOTE:

For generating faces out of xbm files you must use
the following helper filters:

    xbm2ikon

and perhaps

    xbmsize48 or xbmcut48

e.g.

    1) generate a 48x48x1 xbm file
    2) cat <file.xbm> | xbm2ikon > file.ikon
    3) compface file.ikon > file.face

And the other way arround to display a face

Note uncompface -X is the same as

   uncompface | ikon2xbm

useful for exmh!
