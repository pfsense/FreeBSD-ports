OSBF-Lua (Orthogonal Sparse Bigrams with confidence Factor) is a Lua C module
for text classification. It is a port of the OSBF classifier implemented in the
CRM114 project. This implementation attempts to put focus on the classification
task itself by using Lua as the scripting language, a powerful yet light-weight
and fast language, which makes it easier to build and test more elaborated
filters and training methods.
