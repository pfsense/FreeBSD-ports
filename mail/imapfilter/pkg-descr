IMAPFilter is a mail filtering utility. It connects to remote mail servers
using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), sends searching queries to
the server and processes mailboxes based on the results. It can be used to
delete, copy, move, flag, etc. messages residing in mailboxes at the same or
different mail servers.

IMAPFilter uses the Lua programming language as a configuration and extension
language.
