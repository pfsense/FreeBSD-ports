Slowloris both helps identify the timeout windows of a HTTP server or Proxy
server, can bypass httpready protection and ultimately performs a fairly low
bandwidth denial of service.  It has the added benefit of allowing the server
to come back at any time (once the program is killed), and not spamming the
logs excessively.  It also keeps the load nice and low on the target server, so
other vital processes don't die unexpectedly, or cause alarm to anyone who is
logged into the server for other reasons.

The main audience using slowloris is of course a system administrators wanting
to measure their webserver's performance and vulnerability.
