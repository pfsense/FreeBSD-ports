Celero aims to be a small library which can be added to a C++ project and
perform benchmarks on code in a way which is easy to reproduce, share, and
compare among individual runs, developers, or projects. Celero uses a framework
similar to that of GoogleTest to make its API easier to use and integrate into a
project. Make automated benchmarking as much a part of your development process
as automated testing.
