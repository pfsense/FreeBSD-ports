uiCA is a simulator that can predict the throughput of basic blocks on
recent Intel microarchitectures. In addition to that, it also provides
insights into how the code is executed.

uiCA is based on data from uops.info, combined with a detailed pipeline
model. Like related tools, it assumes that all memory accesses result in
cache hits.
