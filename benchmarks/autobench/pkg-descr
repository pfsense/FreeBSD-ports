Autobench is a simple Perl script for automating the process of benchmarking
a web server (or for conducting a comparative test of two different web
servers). The script is a wrapper around  httperf. Autobench runs httperf a
number of times against each host, increasing the number of requested
connections per second on each iteration, and extracts the significant data
from the httperf output, delivering a CSV or TSV format file which can be
imported directly into a spreadsheet for analysis/graphing.
