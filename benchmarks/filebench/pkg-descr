Filebench is a file system and storage benchmark that can generate a large
variety of workloads. Unlike typical benchmarks it is extremely flexible and
allows to specify application's I/O behavior using its extensive Workload Model
Language (WML). Users can either describe desired workloads from scratch or use
(with or without modifications) workload personalities shipped with Filebench
(e.g., mail-, web-, file-, and database-server workloads). Filebench is equally
good for micro- and macro-benchmarking, quick to setup, and relatively easy to
use.
