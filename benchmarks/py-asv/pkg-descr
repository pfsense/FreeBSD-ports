airspeed velocity (asv) is a tool for benchmarking Python packages
over their lifetime.

It is primarily designed to benchmark a single project over its
lifetime using a given suite of benchmarks. The results are displayed
in an interactive web frontend that requires only a basic static
webserver to host.
