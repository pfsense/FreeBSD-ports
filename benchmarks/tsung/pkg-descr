Tsung is an open-source multi-protocol distributed load testing tool

It can be used to stress HTTP, WebDAV, SOAP, PostgreSQL, MySQL, LDAP and
Jabber/XMPP servers. Tsung is a free software released under the GPLv2 license.

The purpose of Tsung is to simulate users in order to test the scalability and
performance of IP based client/server applications. You can use it to do load
and stress testing of your servers. Many protocols have been implemented and
tested, and it can be easily extended.

It can be distributed on several client machines and is able to simulate
hundreds of thousands of virtual users concurrently (or even millions if you
have enough hardware ...).

Tsung is developed in Erlang, an open-source language made by Ericsson for
building robust fault-tolerant distributed applications.
