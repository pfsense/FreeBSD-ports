HPL is a software package that solves a (random) dense linear system in double
precision (64 bits) arithmetic on distributed-memory computers. It can thus be
regarded as aportable as well as freely available implementation of the High
Performance Computing Linpack Benchmark.

The algorithm used by HPL can be summarized by the following keywords:
Two-dimensional block-cyclic data distribution - Right-looking variant of the
LU factorization with row partial pivoting featuring multiple look-ahead
depths - Recursive panel factorization with pivot search and column broadcast
combined - Various virtual panel broadcast topologies - bandwidth reducing
swap-broadcast algorithm - backward substitution with look-ahead of depth 1.

The HPL package provides a testing and timing program to quantify the accuracy
of the obtained solution as well as the time it took to compute it. The best
performance achievable by this software on your system depends on a large
variety of factors. Nonetheless, with some restrictive assumptions on the
interconnection network, the algorithm described here and its attached
implementation are scalable in the sense that their parallel efficiency is
maintained constant with respect to the per processor memory usage.
