Pathrate is a tool that can estimate the capacity of network paths. An
important feature of Pathrate is that it is robust to cross traffic
effects, meaning that it can measure the path capacity even when the
path is significantly loaded. This is crucial, since the hardest paths
to measure are the heavily loaded ones.
