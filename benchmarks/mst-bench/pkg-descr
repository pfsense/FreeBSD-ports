MST-bench is a simple program to measure optimal sustainable memory and disk
performance.

Unlike many benchmarks, it does not attempt to simulate naturally occurring
loads. Rather, it indicates what is the best performance you can expect out of
your hardware, providing a reference to which software can be compared.
