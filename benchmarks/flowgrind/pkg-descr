Flowgrind is an advanced TCP traffic generator for testing and
benchmarking Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X TCP/IP stacks. In
contrast to similar tools like iperf or netperf it features a
distributed architecture, where throughput and other metrics are
measured between arbitrary flowgrind server processes.
