The Unix Benchmark Utility "ubench" is an attempt to introduce a single measure
of perfomance among computer systems running various flavors of Unix operation
system.

The current development release tests only CPU(s) and memory. In the future
releases there will be tests added for disk and TCP/IP. Ubench is taking
advantage of multiple CPUs on an SMP system and the results will reflect that.

o Ubench is executing rather senseless mathematical integer and floating-point
  calculations for 3 mins concurrently using several processes, and the result
  Ubench CPU benchmark.

o Ubench will spawn about 2 concurrent processes for each CPU available on the
  system. This ensures all available raw CPU horsepower is used.

o Ubench is executing rather senseless memory allocation and memory to memory
  copying operations for another 3 mins concurrently using several processes,
  and the result Ubench MEM benchmark.
