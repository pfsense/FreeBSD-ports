Iorate is a general purpose storage I/O benchmarking tool.

Iorate was created in 1997 by Vince Westin of EMC while working with Cliff
Burrell of FedEx to fill a need to perform a set of storage I/O benchmarks.
Though Iorate was developed by EMC staff with EMC resources there are no
EMC-specific pieces to the testing, it just tests storage.
