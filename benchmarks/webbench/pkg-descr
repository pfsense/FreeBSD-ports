webbench is very simple HTTP benchmarking tool, which can benchmark
both WWW and proxy servers. webbench uses fork() for simulating
multiple clients and supports benchmarking by HTTP/0.9-HTTP/1.1
requests (without Keep-Alive). This benchmark is not very realistic,
but can test if your HTTPD can really handle many clients at once (try
to run some CGIs) without taking your machine down. I am using this
program for setting maximum number of Apaches. Webbench displays
results in pages/min and bytes/sec.
