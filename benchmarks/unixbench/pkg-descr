UnixBench based on the BYTE UNIX Benchmarks v3.
The purpose of UnixBench is to provide a basic indicator of the performance
of a Unix-like system; hence, multiple tests are used to test various aspects of
the system's performance. These test results are then compared to the scores
from a baseline system to produce an index value, which is generally easier to
handle than the raw scores. The entire set of index values is then combined to
make an overall index for the system.
