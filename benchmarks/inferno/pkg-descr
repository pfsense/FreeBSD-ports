Inferno is a port of parts of the flamegraph toolkit to Rust, with the aim of
improving the performance of the original flamegraph tools. The primary focus is
on speeding up the stackcollapse-* tools that process output from various
profiling tools into the "folded" format expected by the flamegraph plotting
tool. So far, the focus has been on parsing profiling results from perf and
DTrace.
