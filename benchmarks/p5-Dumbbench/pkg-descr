This module attempts to implement reasonably robust benchmarking with little
extra effort and expertise required from the user. That is to say, benchmarking
using this module is likely an improvement over

  time some-command --to --benchmark

or

  use Benchmark qw/timethis/;
  timethis(1000, 'system("some-command", ...)');

The module currently works similar to the former command line, except (in layman
terms) it will run the command many times, estimate the uncertainty of the
result and keep iterating until a certain user-defined precision has been
reached. Then, it calculates the resulting uncertainty and goes through some
pain to discard bad runs and subtract overhead from the timings. The reported
timing includes an uncertainty, so that multiple benchmarks can more easily be
compared.

Please note that Dumbbench works entirely with wallclock time as reported by
Time::HiRes' time() function.
