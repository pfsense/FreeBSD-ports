This is an ANSI C version of the SciMark2 benchmark, translated from the
original Java sources. The intent in making this benchmark available in
C is mainly for performance comparisons.

Version 4.0 of the software has added check-sum counters to adequately test
newer optimizing compilers.

Results of this benchmark can be sent to pozo@nist.gov.
