apib is a tool that makes it easy to run performance tests of HTTP API
servers.  It has most of the features of Apache Bench (ab), but is also
intended as a more modern replacement.  In particular, it offers:

  - Proper HTTP 1.1 support including keep-alives and chunked encoding
  - Ability to spawn multiple I/O threads to take advantage of multiple
    CPU cores
  - Non-blocking I/O for high concurrency
  - Support for POST and PUT of large objects
  - Support for OAuth 1.0 signatures
  - Ability to output results to a file so they may be automated
  - Remote CPU monitoring
  - Simple command-line interface
