dkftpbench is an FTP benchmark program inspired by SPECweb99.  The result of
the benchmark is a number-of-simultaneous-users rating; after running the
benchmark properly, you have a good idea how many simultaneous dialup clients
a server can support.  The target bandwidth per client is set at 28.8
kilobits/second to model dialup users; this is important for servers on the
real Internet, which often serve thousands of clients on only 10 MBits/sec of
bandwidth.
