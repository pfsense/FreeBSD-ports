Iozone: 'IO Zone' Benchmark Program (older 2.1 version)

Iozone tests the speed of sequential I/O to actual files.  Therefore,
this measurement factors in the efficiency of your machine's file
system, operating system, C compiler, and C runtime library.  It
produces a measurement which is the number of bytes per second that
your system can read or write to a file.

This is the 2.1 version of iozone.  The new 3.x+ versions of iozone have
completely changed their testing methods, thus their output is useless in
comparing with older statistics.
