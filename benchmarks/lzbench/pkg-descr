lzbench is an in-memory benchmark of open-source LZ77/LZSS/LZMA compressors.
It joins all compressors into a single executable.  At the beginning, an
input file is read to memory.  Then all compressors are used to compress
and decompress the file and decompressed file is verified.

This approach has a big advantage of using the same compiler with the same
optimizations for all compressors.  The disadvantage is that it requires
source code of each compressor (therefore Slug or lzturbo are not included).
