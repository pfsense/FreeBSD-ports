The Slack platform offers several APIs to build apps. Each Slack API
delivers part of the capabilities from the platform, so that you can
pick just those that fit for your needs. This SDK offers a corresponding
package for each of Slackâ€™s APIs. They are small and powerful when used
independently, and work seamlessly when used together, too.
