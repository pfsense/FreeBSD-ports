The Slack platform offers several APIs to build apps. Each Slack API
delivers part of the capabilities from the platform, so that you can
pick just those that fit for your needs. This SDK offers a corresponding
package for each of APIs from Slack. They are small and powerful when
used independently, and work seamlessly when used together, too.
