#### NOTES OF SSHOUT
In order to start sshout service you need some more configuration:

If you installed SSHOUT for the first time, use sshoutcfg(8) to add users.
You must have SSH server running and accepting public key authentication.

For HTML messages be properly displayed in CLI frontend, elinks(1) version
0.12 or later is required; however the ports tree currently doesn't have an
up-to-date elinks version available. You will have to install the required
version manually, if such support is needed.
