Secure Shout Host Oriented Unified Talk is an instant-messaging platform
designed to make uses of the existing SSH server in your system.
SSHOUT creates a private chat room in your host. The authentication of the
chat room is done by SSH public authentication. Users can join your chat room
by either directly connecting your SSH server with any SSH client; or using a
SSHOUT client that implemented the client side SSHOUT API.
This package provides the SSHOUT server side programs; if you are finding a
SSHOUT client, go to project page and find out a suitable client; or you can
also write your own client using SSHOUT API.
