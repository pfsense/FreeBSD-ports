  message: <<EOM
Prosody 13.0 will function correctly on any config file that is compatible
with 0.12. No changes are required, however there may be some recommendations.
The best way to find these is to run:

  prosodyctl check config

If you are upgrading from an earlier release and you use PostgreSQL or SQLite
for storage, Prosody may refuse to initialize storage until you complete a
schema upgrade. To check for any necessary schema upgrades and apply them, run:

  prosodyctl mod_storage_sql upgrade
