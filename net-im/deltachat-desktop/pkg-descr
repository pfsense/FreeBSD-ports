Delta Chat is a reliable, decentralized and secure messaging app,
available for mobile and desktop platforms.

Delta Chat feels like Whatsapp or Telegram but you can also use and
regard it as an e-mail app. You can signup anonymously to a variety of
interoperable chatmail servers which are minimal e-mail servers
optimized for fast and secure operations. Or you may use classic e-mail
servers and an existing e-mail account in which case Delta Chat acts as
an e-mail app.
