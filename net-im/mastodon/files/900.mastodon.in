# These are daily tasks to ensure that Mastodon runs smoothly.
#
# Feed clear: Removes timelines of users who haven't signed in lately, which
# saves RAM and improves message distribution. This is required to be run
# periodically so that when they login again the regeneration process will
# trigger.
#
# Media clear: Remove media attachments that have not been assigned to any status
# for longer than a day.
#
# Users clear: Clear timelines of inactive users.
#
# Push refresh: Resubscribes PuSH for expiring remote users. This should be run
# quite often as the expiration time depends on the particular hub of the remote
# user.
