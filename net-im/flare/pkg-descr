Flare is an unofficial Electron-Free Signal app written in Rust
which makes it more lightweight and faster to obtain on your own.
It is still in development and doesn't include all the features
that the official Signal app do.

Even though things like linked credentials, contact and group
details and message contens are encrypted, it's still not
guaranteed for the security of your data. This application
will probably worsen the security compared to official
Signal app. Use this application with care when handling
sensitive data.

Not encrypted:
* Number of contacts and groups
* Number of messages in a chat
* Message timestamps
