  message: <<EOM
6cord was successfully installed.

Example configuration:
======================

If you want a persistent login, copy the configuration file to your home directory:

mkdir -p ~/.config/6cord # Create the config directory if non-existent
cp %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/6cord.toml ~/.config/6cord

From there, you can make adjustments to the 6cord.toml configuration file.
It's suggested you replace the token value, rather than use your Discord email
and plain-text password. You will no longer need to provide the '-t' (token), 'u' 
(username) or '-p' (password) flag when starting 6cord, depending on the values
you provided in the configuration.

For more information, read the full help-page by running:

6cord -h
