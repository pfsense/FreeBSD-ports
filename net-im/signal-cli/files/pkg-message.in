Quick start
===========

1. Generate a QR code to link this signal-cli to the other user device like a
   phone or tablet with a Signal app (this step requires qrencode(1), which is
   an additional utility provided by the graphics/libqrencode port):

       signal-cli link -n DEVICENAME | xargs -n 1 qrencode -t ANSI256

2. Scan the generated QR code with an app.

3. Send a test message to yourself:

       signal-cli -u NUMBER send -m "This is a test" NUMBER

See the signal-cli wiki for more details:

Running a signal-cli daemon (using D-Bus user bus)
==================================================

The DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable should be present for
signal-cli to function properly when run as a daemon (`signal-cli daemon`).

The easiest way is to run the graphical session with dbus-run-session(1), e.g.:

    dbus-run-session -- startx

signal_cli service (using D-Bus system bus)
===========================================

There is an rc(8) script available for signal-cli if it's desired to use
signal-cli in a daemon mode with the D-Bus system bus.

First, configure the service in rc.conf(5):

    sysrc signal_cli_enable="YES"
    sysrc signal_cli_phone_number="+48123456789"

Before starting the service, it is needed to either register a new Signal
account or to link this machine with an existing account. It is possible to
create a linking URL this way:

    service signal_cli runcli link -n DEVICENAME
