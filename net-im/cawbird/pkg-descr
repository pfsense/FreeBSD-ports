Cawbird is a fork of the Corebird Twitter client from Baedert, which became
unsupported after Twitter disabled the streaming API.

Cawbird works with the new APIs and includes a few fixes and modifications
that have historically been patched in to IBBoard's custom Corebird build
on his personal Open Build Service account.
