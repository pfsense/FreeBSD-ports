Spectral is a glossy cross-platform client for Matrix, the decentralized
communication protocol for instant messaging. Spectral is a Matrix client
with the maximum features available while keeping a simple, clean and
modern design. It is a Qt-based client as beautiful as Electron apps
(e.g. Riot.im Web) while using far less resources and still being
considered as "native".
