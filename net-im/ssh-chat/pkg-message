Please note that despite having SSH in its name ssh-chat is not secure
because in its default configuration it doesn't require client
authentication, and is therefore susceptible to MITM attacks. ssh-chat
can be made secure by enabling SSH authentication, or running it within
the Tor network and hosting its server as a hidden service on Tor.
