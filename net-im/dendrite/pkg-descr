Dendrite is a second-generation Matrix homeserver written in Go. It
intends to provide an efficient, reliable and scalable alternative to
Synapse:

  o Efficient: A small memory footprint with better baseline
    performance than an out-of-the-box Synapse.

  o Reliable: Implements the Matrix specification as written, using
    the same test suite as Synapse as well as a brand new Go test suite.

  o Scalable: can run on multiple machines and eventually scale to
    massive homeserver deployments.
