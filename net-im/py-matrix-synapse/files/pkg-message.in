Configuring Synapse:

The following command can be used to generate a sample configuration of synapse:

%%PYTHON_CMD%% -B -m synapse.app.homeserver -c %%ETCDIR%%/homeserver.yaml --generate-config -H <SERVER_NAME> --report-stats no

Please note that you will still need to manually configure paths to log
directory, database, and media storage with this method.

  message: <<EOM
Synapse 1.51.0 deprecates webclient listeners and non-HTTP(S)
web_client_location settings. Please update your homeserver configurations
accordingly.

Additionally, if you run your own turn server for WebRTC and
use Let's Encrypt certificates, be advised that some Android and iOS clients
may be unable to connect. Please see upstream's turn-howto[0] for additional
details on this issue.

The default room version of synapse has been increased to version 9. Consider
changing this if interoperability with other matrix servers is an issue.

If you're using Mjolnir, be advised that this version of synapse is
incompatible with Mjolnir 1.3.1 and earlier.

Running synapse with the sqlite backend is only recommended for testing purposes.
Future versions of synapse will disable federation by default if sqlite is used.

{ type: upgrade
  maximum_version: 1.55.2
  message: <<EOM
Synapse will now refuse to start up if open registration is enabled, in order to help
mitigate abuse across the federation. If you would like to provide registration to
anyone, consider adding email, recaptcha or token-based verification in order to
prevent automated registration from bad actors. This check can be disabled by setting
the enable_registration_without_verification option in your homeserver configuration
file to true. More details are available in the upgrade notes[0].

Synapse will additionally now refuse to start when using PostgreSQL with a non-C values
for COLLATE and CTYPE, unless the config flag allow_unsafe_locale, found in the database
section of the configuration file, is set to true. See the upgrade notes[1] for details.

Starting with synapse 1.62.0, this port will no longer ship with sqlite support
by default. If you rely on sqlite for your setup, please either migrate to
postfix, install the sqlite dependency manually or build a custom flavor of the
port.
