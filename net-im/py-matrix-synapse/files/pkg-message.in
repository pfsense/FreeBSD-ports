Configuring Synapse:

The following command can be used to generate a sample configuration of synapse:

%%PYTHON_CMD%% -B -m synapse.app.homeserver -c %%ETCDIR%%/homeserver.yaml --generate-config -H <SERVER_NAME> --report-stats no

Please note that you will still need to manually configure paths to log
