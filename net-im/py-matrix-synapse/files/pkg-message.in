Configuring Synapse:

The following command can be used to generate a sample configuration of synapse:

%%PYTHON_CMD%% -B -m synapse.app.homeserver -c %%ETCDIR%%/homeserver.yaml --generate-config -H <SERVER_NAME> --report-stats no

Please note that you will still need to manually configure paths to log
directory, database, and media storage with this method.

  message: <<EOM
Starting with Synapse v1.0, valid TLS certificates will be required for
server-to-server communication. Self-signed certificates often autogenerated
with previous versions will no longer suffice. Please ensure that the
certificate specified by the "tls_certificate_path" option in your
homeserver.yaml points to a valid certificate.
