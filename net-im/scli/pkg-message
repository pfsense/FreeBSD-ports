Sometimes, scli does not show the contact list immediately (e.g., after scli
was not closed by issuing ":quit" but by sending SIGINT instead). In such a
situation, it might be necessary to refresh scli by issuing ":reload".

In case it is not enough, the following instructions explain how to clean up
existing scli and signal-cli files and start again:

1. Remove ~/.local/share/scli and ~/.local/share/signal-cli.
2. Register (or link) the machine again with signal-cli.
3. Start scli and let it run for a couple of seconds (so that the signal-cli
   daemon can synchronize with the Signal servers).
4. Issue a ":reload" command in the scli prompt.

The contact list should now be visible.
