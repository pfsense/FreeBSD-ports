GoToSocial is an ActivityPub social network server, written in Golang.

With GoToSocial, you can keep in touch with your friends, post, read,
and share images and articles. All without being tracked or advertised
to!

GoToSocial provides a lightweight, customizable, and safety-focused
entryway into the Fediverse, and is comparable to (but distinct from)
existing projects such as Mastodon, Pleroma, Friendica, and PixelFed.
