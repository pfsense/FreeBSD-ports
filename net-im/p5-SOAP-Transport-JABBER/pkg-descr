SOAP::Transport::JABBER provides a Jabber-based transport backend for
SOAP::Lite.

This class uses the Net::Jabber classes to abstract the Jabber protocol away
from the direct notice of the application. Besides maintaining any needed
objects internally, the package also uses a separate class as a proxy between
communication layers, SOAP::Transport::JABBER::Query. The Jabber support
provides both client and server classes.
