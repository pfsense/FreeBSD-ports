Ncspot is a Spotify client written in Rust.  It is heavily inspired
by ncurses MPD clients, such as ncmpc.  It provides a simple and
resource friendly alternative to the official client as well as
support for platforms that currently do not have a Spotify client,
such as the BSDs.

Ncspot requires a Spotify Premium account.
