ALO is an LV2 plugin primarily targeted at the MOD Duo but hopefully it should
work on other systems too. It's based on the amp.c and metro.c lv2 example
plugins, plus some study of the loopor code.

The idea is to provide an easy, mistake-proof way to create and trigger live
music loops in sync with a click track.
