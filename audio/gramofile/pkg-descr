This is version 1.6P-7 of GramoFile (patches are from the debian package).
With this program you can record audio of (for example) gramophone records,
process the signal and listen to the results. Because sound files of the
.WAV-format are used, it is possible to exchange the files with many other
programs. Cdrecord(1) can burn CD-Recordables of these, so you can make
CDs with the music of your favorite records.  The user interface of
GramoFile has a windows-like look-and-feel, making it fairly easy to use.

One of the most important parts of GramoFile is the ability to process
digital audio signals. Through the application of several filters it is
possible to accomplish a significant reduction of disturbances like ticks
and scratches.

Another interesting feature is the track splitting. Just make one .wav file
of an entire side of an record and GramoFile will detect where the individual
tracks are located. This happens fully automatically, without need to set
any options. More experienced users may fine-tune the algorithm, or change
the detected track starts and ends, but generally that will not be
necessary. Track-times are saved in an editable (plaintext) .tracks file,
that will be used during the signal processing to produce one processed
.wav file for each individual track.
