Fomp is an LV2 port of the MCP, VCO, FIL, and WAH plugins by Fons Adriaensen.

There are 13 plugins in total: 1 auto-wah, 1 EQ, 3 chorus, 5 filters, and
3 oscillators.

The plugin implementations are identical to their LADSPA forebears, except the
primary frequency port of oscillators and filters has been converted to Hz to
facilitate use in any host without assuming the hidden tuning frequency of
AlsaModularSynth. All other frequency ports remain as they were, using octaves
for faithful Moog-like modulation.

Aside from that, the main benefit of these LV2 ports is improved metadata: CV
ports are distinguishable from audio ports, controls have units where
applicable, documentation is built-in for display in host UIs, and so on.

The oscillators and filters are mainly useful in modular synthesizers, but since
CV ports are distinct from audio ports, they should work fine in non-modular
hosts as well.
