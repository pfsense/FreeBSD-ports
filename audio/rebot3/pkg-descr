rebot3.pl renames MP3 files that you have grabbed from audio CDs with
the track name, number, album, and/or artist. It does so by using
either a remote CDDB server or a local CDDB created by cd (and other)
players like xmcd, kscd or xmms. With rebot3.pl you can also add or
remove ID3 (version 1) tags to/from the MP3 files.
