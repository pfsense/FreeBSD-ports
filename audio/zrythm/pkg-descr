Zrythm is built using C and the GTK+3 toolkit and borrows ideas, concepts and
code from other projects such as Ardour and Jalv. It is built with the intention
to provide GNU/Linux and BSD users a full-featured alternative to proprietary
DAWs and offers a unique approach to workflow that other GNU/Linux DAWs lack.
