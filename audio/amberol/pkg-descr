Amberol aspires to be as small, unintrusive, and simple as possible. It does
not manage your music collection; it does not let you manage playlists, smart
or otherwise; it does not let you edit the metadata for your songs; it does
not show you lyrics for your songs, or the Wikipedia page for your bands.
