This application's purpose in life is to take a WAV file and break it
up into multiple WAV files. It makes a clean break at the correct
position to burn the files to an Audio CD without any dead air between
the tracks.

wavbreaker now also directly supports breaking up MP3s without
re-encoding meaning it's fast and there is no generational
loss. Decoding (using mpg123) is only done for playback and waveform
display.

The GUI displays a waveform summary of the entire file at the top. The
middle portion displays a zoomed-in view that allows you to select
where to start playing and where it will make the break. The bottom
portion contains a list of track breaks. You may change file names and
uncheck parts that you do not want to have written out to disk when
saving.

There is also a command line tool wavmerge to merge WAV files
together. If you download a show and don't like how it was tracked,
you can merge them together with wavmerge and then break them back up
with wavbreaker. The wavmerge tool will only work on files that have
the same format (for example, 44.100 Hz sample rate, 16-bit sample
size, etc.).
