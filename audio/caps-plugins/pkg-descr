The C* Audio Plugin Suite, is a collection of highly refined LADSPA
units capable of (and intended for) realtime operation. The suite
includes DSP units emulating instrument amplifiers, stomp-box
classics, versatile 'virtual analogue' oscillators, fractal
oscillation, reverb, equalization and others.

LADSPA has been superceded by LV2. caps plugins were reimplemented based on
the LV2 technology and ported to FreeBSD as audio/caps-lv2.
