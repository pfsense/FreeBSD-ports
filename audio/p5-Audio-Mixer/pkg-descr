Audio::Mixer - Perl extension for Sound Mixer control

This is just a very simple Perl interface which allows to set various
sound mixer parameters. The most important probably 'vol' (volume). The
list of all mixer parameters can be obtained using get_mixer_params()
function.

All values (lcval, rcval) are numbers in 0-100 range.
