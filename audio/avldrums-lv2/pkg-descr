avldrums.lv2 is a drum sample player plugin written by Robin Gareus
dedicated to Glen MacArthur's AVLdrums. This self-contained plugin
provides a convenient way to rapidly sequence and mix midi-drums.

The AVLdrums comes as two separate drumkits: Black Pearl and Red Zeppelin.
There are 5 velocity layers for each of the 28 kits pieces or drum-zones
for both kits.

The main benefits compared to loading the soundfont into a generic sample
player are:
* built-in MIDNAM: The plugin informs the host about note-names
* Semantic grouping of ports: fan-out separate mics to individual tracks
* Compatible stereo/multi-out variant: Allows to in-place replace the stereo
  version with multi-out. Start with stereo when sequencing and when moving
  to the mixing stage use separate outputs to process or customize level and
  pan of individual drums.
