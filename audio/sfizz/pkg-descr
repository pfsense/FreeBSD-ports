sfizz is a sample-based musical synthesizer.

It features the well-established SFZ instrument format (https://sfzformat.com/)
at its core, which permits to use existing instrument libraries, or create
personal instruments with ease.

Not only is sfizz ready-to-use as an instrument plugin of its own, the library
allows developers to create instruments of their own, taking advantage of the
abilities of SFZ.
