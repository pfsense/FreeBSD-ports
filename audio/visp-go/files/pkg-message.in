Limitations:
============

Visp requires a Spotify Premium account and will not work with free accounts.

Visp is not a player, but a controller, and is thus not capable of outputting
sound. You can run the official Spotify client in the background, play back
on Spotify enabled devices, and if you want a headless/server it is recommend
to use spotifyd as a Spotify client daemon.

Getting started:
================

To authorize Visp to your Spotify account, please visit https://visp.site/authorize
to get an access token. Enter your access token with :auth <TOKEN>.

Visp is based around the concept of lists. Every view in Visp is a list of some kind.
Upon starting the program, you are shown the log console, which keeps track of things
that happen within the program. Other lists contain playlists, albums, or tracks.

To get an overview of all the lists you've visited while running Visp, press w.

To enter a command, type : followed by the command, then press <Enter>. While entering
a command, you can press <Tab> to engage tab completion, which will complete the word
you're typing, provided that Visp can guess what you're trying to do. Tab completion
in Visp is very powerful and can recognize pretty much anything you want to accomplish.
See command documentation for a list of all supported commands.

Press <F1>, or enter the command help, at any time to show a list of key bindings.
