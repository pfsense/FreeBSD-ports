Visp is an interactive console client for Spotify, written in Go.
Its interface is similar to Vim, and aims to be fast, configurable,
and practical. Visp means whisk, and just like the simple mechanical
tool it makes it easy to create that smooth and perfect mixture through
the power of manual control, and without any unfortunate lumps.

This interface has many features that involve sorting, searching, and
navigating. It's designed to let you navigate your music collection
effectively and efficiently.
