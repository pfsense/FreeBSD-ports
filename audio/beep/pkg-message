Speaker sound support:
======================

For PC speaker sound to work you need to be in the operator group
and need r/w permissions to /dev/speaker device.

Load kernel module:

# kldload speaker

Add a user to operator group:

% pw groupmod operator -m jerry

Uncomment the following lines in /etc/devfs.rules file (create it
if it doesn't exist):

# Allow members of group operator to cat things to the speaker

[speaker=10]
add path 'speaker' mode 0660 group operator

To load these new rules add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

devfs_speaker_ruleset="speaker"

Then restart devfs to load the new rules:

% /etc/rc.d/devfs restart
EOM
}
