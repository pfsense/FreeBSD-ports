Bespoke is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).

Bespoke's core design is to break everything into separate modules that can be
patched together in a custom layout, much like a hardware modular. Bespoke is
designed to be highly customizable, with the idea that any of the custom layouts
that you create will be "bespoke" to you as well.
