Sayonara is a small, clear, and fast audio player for Unix-like systems,
written in C++ on Qt 5.x framework and using GStreamer as audio backend.

Although Sayonara is considered as a lightweight player, it holds a lot
of features to organize even big music collections.

Most of them are known from the bigger and well known audio players. But
in contrast to most of the other players the main focus during developing
has been performance, low CPU usage, and low memory consumption.

So Sayonara is a good alternative to players like Rhythmbox, Clementine,
or Amarok.  Those who miss Winamp for Unix should give Sayonara a try.
One of Sayonara's goals is intuitive and easy usability.
