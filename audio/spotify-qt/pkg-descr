A Spotify client using Qt as a simpler, lighter alternative to the official
client, inspired by spotify-tui. Much like spotify-tui, you need an actual
Spotify client running, for example spotifyd, which can be configured from
within the app. Also like other clients, controlling music playback requires
Spotify Premium.
