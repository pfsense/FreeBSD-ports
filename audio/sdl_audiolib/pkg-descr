This is a small and simple to use C++ library for playing various
audio formats. It is a thin (-ish) wrapper around existing resampling
(like SRC or SoX) and decoding libraries (like libmpg123 or libvorbis.)

It was written as a replacement for SDL_mixer, due to SDL_mixer's
lack of multiple music streams, limited audio format support and
poor resampling quality.
