Audiere is a high-level audio API. It can play Ogg Vorbis, MP3,
FLAC, uncompressed WAV, AIFF, MOD, S3M, XM, and IT files. For audio
output, Audiere supports DirectSound or WinMM in Windows, OSS on
Linux and Cygwin, and SGI AL on IRIX.

Audiere is open source and licensed under the LGPL. This means that
you may freely use Audiere in commercial products, as long as you
do not modify the source code. If you do modify Audiere and release
a product that uses your modifications, you must release your changes
to the code under the LGPL as well.

Audiere is portable. It is tested on Windows, Linux-i386, Cygwin,
and IRIX with at least three major compilers. Most of Audiere is
endian-independent, so I expect it would work with few modifications
on other architectures.
