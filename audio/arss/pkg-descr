The Analysis & Resynthesis Sound Spectrograph (formerly known as the Analysis &
Reconstruction Sound Engine), or ARSS, is a program that analyses a sound file
into a spectrogram and is able to synthesise this spectrogram, or any other
user-created image, back into a sound.

ARSS is now superseded by Photosounder, which makes use of most of the
techniques offered by ARSS in a simple to use and powerful graphical user
interface and built in editor.
