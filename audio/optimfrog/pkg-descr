OptimFROG is a lossless audio compression program. Its main goal is to reduce
at maximum the size of audio files, while permitting bit identical restoration
for all input. It is similar with the ZIP compression, but it is highly
specialized to compress audio data.

OptimFROG usually obtains the best lossless audio compression ratios. It has
Windows, Linux, OS X, and FreeBSD versions, fully featured input plug-ins for
the Windows Media Player, foobar2000, Winamp 2/3/5, dBpowerAMP, XMPlay, QCD,
XMMS, and many other audio players (with bitstream error resilience, ID3v1.1
and APEv2 read tagging support, ID3v2 compatible), optimal support for all
integer PCM wave formats up to 32 bits and an extensible streamable (error
tolerant) compressed format. It is also fast, the default mode (preset 2)
encodes CD quality audio data at 66.9x real-time and decodes at 96.9x real-time
on Intel Core i7-6700HQ at 2.6 GHz, while the fastest mode (preset 0) encodes
at 140.0x real-time and decodes at 138.0x real-time. Self-extracting (sfx)
archives can also be created with a small overhead of just 173 kB.

The compression ratios which can obtained with OptimFROG are generally ranging
from 25% (silent classical music) to 70% (loud rock music) of the original
audio file size. This is less compared with around 13% obtained with high
quality MP3 files (~176 kbps), but you have the great advantage of archiving
and listening at perfect copies of your original music.
