Due to toolchain issues, the bpm plugin will probably not work
out-of-the-box. Upon startup, picard will likely write to stderr
something like:

  Original error was: /lib/libgcc_s.so.1: version GCC_4.8.0 required by 
  %%LOCALBASE%%/lib/gcc%%GCC_VER%%/libgfortran.so.4 not found

This will not affect other plugins or picard operations. If you wish to
use the bpm plugin, you can use the following workaround until a better
solution can be worked out:

  $ env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=%%LOCALBASE%%/lib/gcc%%GCC_VER%% picard
