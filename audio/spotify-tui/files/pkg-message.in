spotifyt-tui was successfully installed.

Limitations:
============

This app uses the Web API from Spotify, which doesn't handle streaming itself.
So you'll need either an official Spotify client open or a lightweight alternative
such as spotifyd. If you want to play tracks, Spotify requires that you have a
Premium account. It's recommended you install spotifyd, your machine will be
registered as a Spotify device that you can control from spotify-tui.

You can think of spotify-tui as more of a "controller" or "frontend" to Spotify,
with this setup you can control all your Spotify devices.
