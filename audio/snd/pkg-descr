Snd is a sound editor modeled loosely after Emacs and an old, sorely-missed
PDP-10 sound editor named Dpysnd.  It can accommodate any number of sounds,
each with any number of channels, and can be customized and extended using
Guile, Ruby or Forth.

Included with it are some command-line utilities:
- snd-info (note:  renamed from sndinfo, for this FreeBSD port) prints a
  description of a sound file.
- sndplay plays a sound file.
- sndrecord records sound from a microphone.
- audinfo describes the current state of the audio hardware.
