MixerTUI is an audio mixer with a Terminal User Interface built on the FreeBSD
sound system. It can show the current sound driver configuration, select an
audio device to get its information, change the volume or to set it as default
(switching easily audio from/to laptop and hdmi, headphones and speakers, etc).
