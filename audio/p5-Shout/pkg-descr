This module is an object-oriented interface to libshout, an MP3 streaming
library that allows applications to easily communicate and broadcast to an
Icecast streaming media server. It handles the socket connections, metadata
communication, and data streaming for the calling application, and lets
developers focus on feature sets instead of implementation details.
