abx is a program for performing software-based audio ABX testing. ABX test is a
statistical method for assessing whether you are able to tell for audible
differences between two samples. For example, one sample could be compressed
audio, such as Ogg Vorbis, and another one its uncompressed variant. You could
then use abx to infer whether you are able to separate the two samples due to
compression artifacts.
