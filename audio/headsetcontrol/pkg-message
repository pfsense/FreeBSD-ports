Type headsetcontrol -h to get all available options.

headsetcontrol -s 128 sets the sidetone to 128 (REAL loud). You can silence it with 0. I recommend a loudness of 16.

Following options don't work on all devices yet:

headsetcontrol -b check battery level. Returns a value from 0 to 100 or loading.

headsetcontrol -n 0|1 sends a notification sound, made by the headset. 0 or 1 are currently supported as values.

headsetcontrol -l 0|1 switches LED off/on (off almost doubles battery lifetime!).

headsetcontrol -c cut unnecessary output, for reading by other scripts or applications.
