MAD is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently supports MPEG-1
as well as the MPEG-2 extension to Lower Sampling Frequencies. All
three audio layers (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III a.k.a. MP3) are
fully implemented.

MAD does not yet support MPEG-2 multichannel audio (although it should
be backward compatible with such streams) or AAC, nor does it support
the so-called MPEG 2.5 format.

This is ID3 tag library, which is part of the project.
