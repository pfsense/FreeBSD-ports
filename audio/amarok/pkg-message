In order to use certain devices (MTP, iPod...) with Amarok you need to
be able to mount USB devices as the user running Amarok. If HAL
automount doesn't work, read more on how to set this up on FreeBSD
here:
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/usb-disks.html

If you are not running a full KDE workspace, you should consider
installing a Phonon backend (multimedia/phonon-gstreamer or
multimedia/phonon-vlc) to get audio playback.
