shntool is a multi-purpose WAVE data processing and reporting utility.
File formats are abstracted from its core, so it can process any file
that contains WAVE data, compressed or not -- provided there exists a
format module to handle that particular file type.

Apart from .wav shntool supports many formats through helper programs.
Please see the manual page for more information.
