mpdas has been successfully installed.

To configure mpdas, simply create a file called .mpdasrc in
your home directory or in %%PREFIX%%/etc/mpdasrc.

Syntax is easy. Example:

username = lastfmuser
password = password

Use the runas variable to change the UID the process runs in.

For more information on configuration see:
http://50hz.ws/mpdas/README.txt

To use the rc-script add the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

	mpdas_enable="YES"

Then start mpdas with

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/mpdas start

or reboot.
