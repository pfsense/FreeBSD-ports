LMMS aims to be a free alternative to popular (but commercial and
closed-source) programs like FruityLoops, Cubase and Logic giving you the
ability of producing music with your computer by creating cool loops,
synthesizing and mixing sounds, arranging samples, having more fun with your
MIDI keyboard and much more...

LMMS combines the features of a tracker/sequencer program (pattern/channel/
sample/song/effect management) and those of powerful synthesizers and samplers
in a modern, user-friendly and easy to use graphical user interface.
