B.Jumblr is neither a sample slicer nor a step sequencer. From the technical POV
B.Jumblr is a sequencer pattern-controlled audio delay effect.

The pattern defines at when (vertical) and which (horizontal) piece of the audio
input stream is sent to the audio output. Use the default diagonal line pattern
for live playback. Moving a pad one step to the right results in a one step
delayed playback of the respective piece of the audio input stream. Each pad
(and thus each piece) can be levelled up or down by mouse wheel scrolling.

In addidion, the user can control the playback progession using the playback
buttons or the speed dial. This is facilitated via the progression delay.
