A devd(8) configuration has been installed at:
%%PREFIX%%/etc/devd/maudio-devd.conf.

You must add 'maudio_enable="YES"' to rc.conf
and restart devd(8) for this port to work.

You can optionally add 'maudio_default="YES"'
to rc.conf if you'd like M-Audio devices to
be setup as the default sound device upon
detection.

Some devices (eg. Transit) may also require
sysctl modifications:

hw.usb.uaudio.default_bits=16
hw.usb.uaudio.default_rate=48000
