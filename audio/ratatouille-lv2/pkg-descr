Ratatouille is a Neural Model loader and mixer for Linux/Windows.

It can load two models, which can be *.nam files with the Neural Amp Modeler
module, or *.json or .aidax files with the RTNeural module.

You can also load just a single model file, in that case the "Blend" control
will do nothing. When you've loaded a second model, the "Blend" control will
blend between the two models and mix them to simulate your specific tone.

Ratatouille using parallel processing for the neural models, so, loading a
second neural model wouldn't be remarkable on the dsp load.
