Suil is a lightweight C library for loading and wrapping LV2 plugin UIs.

Suil makes it possible to load a UI of any toolkit in a host using any
other toolkit (assuming the toolkits are both supported by Suil).
Hosts do not need to build against or link to foreign toolkit libraries
to use UIs written with that toolkit; all the necessary magic is performed
by dynamically loaded modules. The API is designed such that hosts do not
need to explicitly support specific toolkits at all - if Suil supports
a particular toolkit, then UIs in that toolkit will work in all hosts
that use Suil automatically.

Suil currently supports every combination of Gtk 2, Qt 4, and X11, e.g. with
Suil a Gtk program can embed a Qt plugin UI without depending on Qt,
and a Qt program can embed a Gtk plugin UI without depending on Gtk.
On Windows, embedding native UIs in Gtk is also supported.
I (David Robillard) would be happy to work with plugin authors
to add support for new toolkits, please contact me if you're interested
in writing a plugin UI using a toolkit that is not yet
supported in the LV2 ecosystem.
