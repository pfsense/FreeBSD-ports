LASH is a session management system for JACK audio applications.  It is an
implementation of a proposal that originated from this discussion.  Its aim
is to allow you to have many different audio programs running at once, to
save their setup, close them down and then easily reload the setup at some
other time.  LASH doesn't deal with any kind of audio data itself; it just
runs programs, deals with saving/loading (arbitrary) data and connects
different kinds of virtual audio ports together (currently JACK and ALSA
sequencer ports).  It can also be used to move entire sessions between
computers, or post sessions on the Internet for download.
