Flacon extracts individual tracks from one big audio file containing the
entire album of music and saves them as separate audio files.

To do this, it uses information from the appropriate CUE file.  Besides,
Flacon makes it possible to conveniently revise or specify tags both for
all tracks at once or for each tag separately.  Its features are:

  - Supported input formats: WAV, FLAC, APE, WavPack, True Audio (TTA)
  - Supported output formats: FLAC, WAV, WavPack, AAC, OGG, or MP3
  - Replay Gain analysis (album-gain and track-gain modes)
  - Automatic character set detection for CUE files
  - Generation of the per-track CUE file in the output directory
  - Multi-threaded conversion process and graphical user interface
