Elisa is a music player developed by the KDE community that strives
to be simple and nice to use. We also recognize that we need a flexible
product to account for the different workflows and use-cases of our users.

We focus on a very good integration with the Plasma desktop of the
KDE community without compromising the support for other platforms
(other Linux desktop environments, Windows and Android).

We are creating a reliable product that is a joy to use and respects
our users privacy. As such, we will prefer to support online services
where users are in control of their data.
