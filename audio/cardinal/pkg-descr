A virtual Eurorack modular synthesizer platform, available as JACK
standalone and LV2, VST2 and VST3 audio plugin for Linux, macOS and
Windows.

This is a DPF-based plugin wrapper around VCV Rack, using its code
directly instead of forking the project.
The target is to have a proper, self-contained, fully free and
open-source plugin version of Rack.
