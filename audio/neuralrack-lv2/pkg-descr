NeuralRack is a Neural Model and Impulse Response File loader.

It supports *.nam files with the Neural Amp Modeler engine, or *.json or .aidax
files with the RTNeural engine.

NeuralRack emulate a simple guitar effect chain with a pedal, a EQ a Amplifier
and a Stereo Cabinet.

Optional, NeuralRack could run the complete process in buffered mode to reduce
the dsp load. The resulting latency will be reported to the host so that it
could be compensated. For information the resulting latency will be shown on
the GUI.

NeuralRack supports resampling when needed to match the expected sample rate of
the loaded models. Both models and the IR Files may have different expectations
regarding the sample rate.
