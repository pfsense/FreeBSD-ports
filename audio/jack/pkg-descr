JACK is a low latency audio server, written for POSIX-conformant operating
systems.  It can connect a number of different applications to an audio
device, as well as allowing them to share audio between themselves.  Its
clients can run in their own processes (i.e. as normal applications), or
can they can run within the JACK server (i.e. as a "plugin").

JACK was designed from the ground up for professional audio work, and its
design focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of all clients, and
low latency operation.
