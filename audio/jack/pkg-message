======================================================================
It is recommended to run Jack with real-time priority. As FreeBSD doesn't
allow unprivileged users to set real-time priority, you should do it manually
with rtprio(1). As this port comes with jackd and jackdbus executables, note
that only one can be used.

Configure backend options using jack_control:
$ jack_control ds oss
$ jack_control eps realtime False
$ jack_control eps sync True

Configure memory locking editing either /etc/login.conf or ~/.login_conf with:
:memorylocked=unlimited:

After every change to login.conf, you should execute:
cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf

There are two ways to start jack:
* via dbus (new executable: jackdbus)
* as rc service (classic executable: jackd)

- Starting via DBUS:
$ jack_control start

- Starting as RC service:
add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf:
jackd_enable="YES"
jackd_user="{your-jack-user}"
jackd_rtprio="YES"
jackd_args="-R -doss -r{sample-rate} -p1024 -n3 -w16 \
            --capture /dev/dsp{N} --playback /dev/dsp{N}"

Where:
- your-jack-user: is the user who is going to use jack; currently
                  only one user is supported
- sample-rate: can be 44100, 48000, etc.
- /dev/dsp{N}: your OSS devices, usually /dev/dsp0
