MP3val is a small, high-speed, free software tool for checking MPEG audio
files' integrity. It can be useful for finding corrupted files (e.g.
incompletely downloaded, truncated, containing garbage). MP3val is also able
to fix most of the problems. Being a multiplatform application, MP3val can be
runned both under Windows and under Linux (or BSD).

The most common MPEG audio file type is MPEG 1 Layer III (mp3), but MP3val
supports also other MPEG versions and layers. The tool is also aware of the
most common types of tags (ID3v1, ID3v2, APEv2).

The core component of MP3val is an application with command-line interface.
There are also two graphical frontends for it: MP3val-frontend is a native
Windows application (it is also included in the latest binary releases for
Windows), mp3valgui is a multi-platform Python script (can be downloaded
separately), written by an independent developer. Installing the latter under
Windows is a bit tricky, so for Windows the first frontend is recommended.
