You installed Jamulus: Internet jam session software

Most users need Jamulus client to listen to or participate in jam sessions
hosted by others.

You can run Jamulus client using the menu item or by running the "jamulus"
command.

Some users also need to run Jamulus server to host jam sessions.

You can run Jamulus server as a graphical program by using the "Jamulus Server"
menu item, or run the "jamulus -s" command.

You can also run Jamulus Server as a headless server. In order to do this you
need to install the jamulus-server package and run:
# sysrc jamulus_server_enable="YES"
# service jamulus-server start
and then navigate to your server by your IP address in the Jamulus Client.

You can also start the Jamulus Server service once with:
# service jamulus-server onestart

Please read https://jamulus.io/wiki/Command-Line-Options and add appropriate
Jamulus Server options to jamulus_server_flags="{your options}"
in /etc/rc.config
