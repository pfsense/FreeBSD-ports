Tags groups of audio files using CDDB.

TagLookup is a utility for tagging MP3s and other taggable audio file formats.
It inspects a set of audio files and uses their lengths to look up an
appropriate disc from a CDDB-compatible service. TagLookup can be used in two
modes:

* ID -- Given a CDDB ID and a number of files, look up the details of the CDDB
  disc from a CDDB service. Tag files using the CDDB disc. Match each file with
  each CDDB track using the closest track length.
* Sequence -- Given a number of files, generate a CDDB ID and query a CDDB
  service. CDDB IDs are generated based on the sequence of tracks. Choose the
  closest matching CDDB disc to tag the files.

As well as this, taglookup can:
* Rename -- Rename files based on their tags.
