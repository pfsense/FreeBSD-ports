Tamgamp (Rhymes with: "Damage Amp") is LV2 guitar amp simulator that provides
two plugins:
* Tamgamp - a plugin based on Guitarix DK Builder simulated chains.
* TamgampGX - a plugin based on tuned Guitarix internal amplifiers
  implementation.

The key features of this project according to initial technical requirements are
* Simplicity of the interface, no UI (use generic one), minimum knobs/sliders.
* Preamplifier simulation only, for simplicity and flexibility (use a separate
  cab simulator).
* Smooth bypass/automation. No pops, spikes or clicks.
* Normalized output level: different amplifiers should sound almost of the same
  output loudness with different gain settings.
