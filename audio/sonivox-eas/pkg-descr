The Sonivox EAS project is a MIDI Synth library based on the Sonivox EAS
Synthesizer published by Google on the Android Open Source Project. It is a
real time GM synthesizer without needing external soundfonts, using embedded
samples instead. It consumes very little resources, so it may be indicated in
Linux projects for small embedded devices.
