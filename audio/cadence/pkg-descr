Cadence is a set of tools useful for audio production.

Cadence itself is also an application (the main one), which this page will
document.
There are other applications that are part of the Cadence suite, they are
usually named as the "Cadence tools".

They are:
* Catarina
* Catia

Some of these also have sub-tools, such as Cadence-JackMeter and
Claudia-Launcher. Each of these sub-tools is properly documented in its
respective page.
