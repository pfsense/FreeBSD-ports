You installed Faust: the programming language for realtime audio
signal processing.

In order to try it, you can put the dsp program from
https://faustdoc.grame.fr/tutorials/basic-osc/ into the source file
example-freeverb_demo.dsp, and run the faust compiler that will create
Qt UI with Jack audio backend:

$ sudo pkg install -A qt6-base
$ cp files/example-freeverb_demo.dsp .
$ faust2jaqt example-freeverb_demo.dsp
$ ./example-freeverb_demo # this assumes that Jack audio server is up and running

It will create the window with sliders and a button that you would
need to press.

In order to compile programs for some audio backend (like Jack,
PortAudio) and UI frontend (like Qt), you need to first install them.
