soundgrab is designed to help you slice up a big long raw audio file
(by default 44.1 kHz 2 channel signed sixteen bit little endian) and
save your favorite sections to other files. It does this by providing
you with a cassette player like command line interface. Commands like
ff <secs>, rw <secs>, jump <offset_from_start> can be used while the
volume is being played or while it is stopped to move the player head
around. The commands mark and name allow you to give names to sections
between the mark and the current position of the player head (like
emacs mark and point concept), and the export command exports the
named sections to other files in wav, cdr (CD mastering), or raw
format (or ogg or flac format if the appropriate encoder binaries are
found on your system).
