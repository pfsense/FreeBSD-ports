The plugin slices a stereo input stream, amplifies or silences the individual
slices and send the whole sequence to the output. Although this affects only the
audio signal, it needs a playback running (Jack transport).

In addition to the global controllers, the interface is divided into three
parts: step controls, monitor and step shape.
