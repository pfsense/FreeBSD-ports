TiMidity++ is a MIDI player without external MIDI instruments.
This can also convert MIDI files to various formatted audio files
(ex. wav, au, etc..).
In addition to this port, "Gravis Ultra Sound" compatible patch files
(or SF2 format SoundFont) are required to play files.

Formerly, the original version of this program was written by Tuuka
Toivonen(until version 0.2i).
Now, Masanao Izumo and many hackers are developing "TiMidity++".
