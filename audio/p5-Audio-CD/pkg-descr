Perl interface to libcdaudio (cd + cddb): http://cdcd.undergrid.net/

This module was created for adding CDDB support to <Xmms::shell> and
cd tray <eject>.  I added methods for a good chunk of other
<libcdaudio> functions while I was at it, but the docs and glue is
not complete.  I do not have interest in completing the interface and
docs, because xmms/Xmms::shell provides everything I need (at the
moment) for audio.  If you have an interesting reason for needing the
missing pieces, I'll probably be interested in adding them.
