In order for cyanrip to rip as accurate as possible,
be sure to set the drive offset.

You can determine the offset by visiting  https://www.daefeatures.co.uk/ ,
http://www.accuraterip.com/driveoffsets.htm , by or using a disc that's in
the AccurateRip database.

Please refer to https://github.com/cyanreg/cyanrip for more information.
