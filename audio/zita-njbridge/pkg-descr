Command line Jack clients to transmit full quality multichannel audio over a
local IP network, with adaptive resampling by the receiver(s). Zita-njbridge can
be used for a one-to-one connection (using UDP) or in a one-to-many system
(using multicast). Sender and receiver(s) can each have their own sample rate
and period size, and no word clock sync between them is assumed. Up 64 channels
can be transmitted, receivers can select any combination of these. On a lightly
loaded or dedicated network zita-njbridge can provide low latency (same as for
an analog connection). Additional buffering can be specified in case there is
significant network delay jitter. IPv6 is fully supported.
