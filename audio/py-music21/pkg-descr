Music21 is a set of tools for helping scholars and other active listeners answer
questions about music quickly and simply. If you've ever asked yourself a
question like, "I wonder how often Bach does that" or "I wish I knew which band
was the first to use these chords in this order," or "I'll bet we'd know more
about Renaissance counterpoint (or Indian ragas or post-tonal pitch structures
or the form of minuets) if I could write a program to automatically write more
of them," then music21 can help you with your work.
