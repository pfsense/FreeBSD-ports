Many audio synthesis and recording packages are in use or in
development. These work in many different ways. LADSPA
provides a standard way for `plugin' audio processors to be used with
a wide range of these packages.

For instance, this allows a developer to make a reverb program and
bundle it into a LADSPA `plugin library.' Ordinary users can then use
this reverb within any LADSPA-friendly audio application.
