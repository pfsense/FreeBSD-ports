SongRec is an open-source Shazam client for Linux, written in Rust.

Features:
* Recognize audio from an arbitrary audio file.
* Recognize audio from the microphone.
* Usage from both GUI and command line (for the file recognition part).
* Provide an history of the recognized songs on the GUI, exportable to CSV.
* Continuous song detection from the microphone, with the ability to choose
  your input device.
* Ability to recognize songs from your speakers rather than your microphone
  (on compatible PulseAudio setups).
* Generate a lure from a song that, when played, will fool Shazam into
  thinking that it is the concerned song.
