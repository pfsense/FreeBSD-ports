Timbre Mill is a tool for timbral correction of audio files.

The tool allows to specify multiple file groups containing two type of files:
* master file;
* child files.

For each file group, the tool performs spectral analysis of master file and each
child file. After that, it computes the raw inverse impulse responses which
allow to tune tonal characteristics of the master file to match the tonal
characteristics of each corresponding child file. These raw IR files allow to
process audio data as linear-phase finite impulse response filters (FIRs).
