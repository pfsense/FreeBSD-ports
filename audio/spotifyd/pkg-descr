An open source Spotify client running as a UNIX daemon.  Spotifyd
streams music just like the official client, but is more lightweight
and supports more platforms.  Spotifyd also supports the Spotify
Connect protocol which makes it show up as a device that can be
controlled from the official clients.

Spotifyd requires a Spotify Premium account.
