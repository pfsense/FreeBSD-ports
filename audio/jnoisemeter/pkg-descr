Jnoisemeter is a small Jack app for accurate measurement of
audio signals, in particular noise signals.

The simplest use is to measure the S/N ratio of your
sound card. If you can calibrate the input levels of
your soundcard it can also be used (with some external
hardware) to measure noise levels of any type of audio
equipment, including preamps and microphones.
