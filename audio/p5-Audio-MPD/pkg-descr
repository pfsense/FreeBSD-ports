Audio::MPD gives a clear object-oriented interface for talking to and
controlling MPD (Music Player Daemon) servers. A connection to the MPD
server is established as soon as a new Audio::MPD object is created.

Note that the module will by default connect to mpd before sending any
command, and will disconnect after the command has been issued. This scheme
is far from optimal, but allows us not to care about timeout disconnections.

/!\ Note that Audio::MPD is using high-level, blocking sockets. This means
that if the mpd server is slow, or hangs for whatever reason, or even
crash abruptly, the program will be hung forever in this sub. The
POE::Component::Client::MPD module is way safer - you're advised to use it
instead of Audio::MPD. Or you can try to set conntype to $REUSE (see
Audio::MPD constructor for more details), but you would be then on your
own to deal with disconnections.
