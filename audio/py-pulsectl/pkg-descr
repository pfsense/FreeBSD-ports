Python (3.x and 2.x) high-level interface and ctypes-based bindings
for PulseAudio (libpulse), mostly focused on mixer-like controls and
introspection-related operations (as opposed to e.g. submitting sound
samples to play, player-like client).

Originally forked from pulsemixer project, which had this code
bundled.
