The DrumGizmo drumkit editor DGEdit is currently in a functioning, but very
early phase of development. All of the essentials for importing, editing and
exporting the raw drumkit recordings are there. Editor is certainly a huge help
when creating the individual drumkit instruments (snare, kickdrum, toms,
crashes and so on). The entire process of taking a bunch of wav files that
you've recorded using, for instance, 16 microphones and then converting them
into working instruments with hit energy levels is fully supported.
