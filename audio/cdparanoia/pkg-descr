Cdparanoia is a Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) Digital Audio Extraction
(DAE) tool, commonly known on the net as a 'ripper'.  The application is
built on top of the Paranoia library, which is doing the real work (the
Paranoia source is included in the cdparanoia source distribution).
Cdparanoia reads audio from the CDROM directly as data, with no analog step
between, and writes the data to a file or pipe in WAV, AIFC, or raw 16 bit
linear PCM.

Cdparanoia is a bit different than most other CDDA extraction tools.  It
contains few-to-no 'extra' features, concentrating only on the ripping
process and knowing as much as possible about the hardware performing it.
Cdparanoia will read correct, rock-solid audio data from inexpensive drives
prone to misalignment, frame jitter, and loss of streaming during atomic
reads.  Cdparanoia will also read and repair data from CDs that have been
damaged in some way.

Cdparanoia is easy to use and administrate.  It has no compile time
configuration, happily autodetecting the CDROM, its type, its interface and
other aspects of the ripping process at runtime.  A single binary can serve
the diverse hardware of the do-it-yourself computer laboratory from Hell.
