The alsa-sndio plugin provides a PCM that connects to a sndiod server
as a fallback for applications that don't support sndio.

Only playback is supported and the plugin does not report accurate
buffer positions at the moment.  Do not expect this to work in a good
way for video playback, browsers, etc.
