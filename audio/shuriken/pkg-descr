Shuriken is an open source beat slicer for Linux which harnesses the power of
aubio's onset detection algorithms and Rubber Band's time stretching
capabilities. A simple Qt interface makes it easy to slice up drum loops, assign
individual drum hits to MIDI keys, and change the tempo of loops in real-time.
The JUCE library takes care of handling audio and MIDI behind the scenes.
