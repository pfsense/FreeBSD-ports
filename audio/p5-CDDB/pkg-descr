The CDDB module implements a Perl class for communicating with an
audio compact disc database through the CDDBP protocol. It allows
querying the database and submitting new entries to it via e-mail
(the Mail::Internet and Mail::Header modules are required for
submitting, but their absence won't affect other functions). Unlike
its analogs, CDDB.pm doesn't try to read a disc in your CD-ROM by
itself, but relies on the main program supplying disc data.
Therefore, it is particularly useful for developing software that
deals with alternative media, such as MPEG audio files.
