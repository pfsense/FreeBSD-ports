midisharelight is a light version of MidiShare.

MidiShare is a real-time operating system for musical applications. It provides
high level services to developers and ensures platform independance.

It supports:
* High level musical events, fully structured and time stamped with a
  millisecond resolution. These events include both the MIDI and the MIDIFile
  typologies.
* An efficient scheduler, in charge of delivering events at their falling dates
  to the communication manager.
* Inter-applications communication.
  A communication manager routes the events to the client applications,
  according to the connection set between them.
* Real-time tasks, to control the real-time behavior of an application. Function
  calls can be scheduled in the future and are automatically achieved by
  MidiShare at interrupt level.
* Real-time alarms. Incoming MidiShare events as well as global context changes
  (new clients starting a session, modifications of the connections between
  applications, etc.) can be processed in real-time by user defined alarms.
