XUiDesigner provides a easy to use GUI generator tool to create
X11 UI's for LV2 plugins. Currently only libxputty is supported,
but the generated GUI C file could be used probably with other widget
tool-kits as well, just a wrapper file is needed to translate the
generated file to the needs of a toolkit.
