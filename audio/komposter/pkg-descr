Komposter is a lightweight music composing system intended mainly to be used in
applications where the size of the executable must be minimized such as 4K and
64K intros.

It is built using a modular "virtual analog" model, where the composer can build
the synthesizers from scratch using simple basic building blocks. This minimizes
the amount of code required and relies more on data, which can be compressed
more effectively.

A simple pattern-based sequencer is used to create songs which use up to 24
voices, each of which can use a different synthesizer. Each synthesizer can be
programmed with a number of patches that can be switched between patterns.
