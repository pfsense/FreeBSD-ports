cutmp3 is a small and fast command line MP3 editor. It lets
you select sections of an MP3 interactively or via a timetable
and save them to separate files without quality loss. It uses
mpg123 for playback and works with VBR files and even with files
bigger than 2GB. Other features are configurable silence seeking
and ID3 tag seeking, which are useful for concatenated mp3s.
