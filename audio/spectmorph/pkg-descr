SpectMorph is a free software project which allows to analyze samples of musical
instruments, and to combine them (morphing). It can be used to construct hybrid
sounds, for instance a sound between a trumpet and a flute; or smooth
transitions, for instance a sound that starts as a trumpet and then gradually
changes to a flute. In its current version, SpectMorph ships with many
ready-to-use instruments which can be combined using morphing.
