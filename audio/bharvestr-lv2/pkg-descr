B.Harvestr is an experimental granular synthesizer LV2 plugin.

In contrast to standard synthesis methods which are based on oscillating waves,
granular synthesis uses micro fragments of audio samples to generate sound.
Thus, granular synthesis uses the same concept as (the majority of) pitch
shifters. Granular synthesizers typically generate lots of overlapping grains to
produce atmospheric sound effects, full soundscapes and pad sounds.
