puddletag is an audio tag editor (primarily created) for GNU/Linux
similar to the Windows program, Mp3tag. Unlike most taggers for
GNU/Linux, it uses a spreadsheet-like layout so that all the tags
you want to edit by hand are visible and easily editable.

The usual tag editor features are supported like extracting tag
information from filenames, renaming files based on their tags by
using patterns and basic tag editing.

Then there're Functions, which can do things like replace text,
trim it, do case conversions, etc. Actions can automate repetitive
tasks. Doing web lookups using Amazon (including cover art), Discogs
(does cover art too!), FreeDB and MusicBrainz is also supported.

Supported formats: ID3v1, ID3v2 (mp3), MP4 (mp4, m4a, etc.),
VorbisComments (ogg, flac), Musepack (mpc), Monkey's Audio (.ape)
and WavPack (wv).
