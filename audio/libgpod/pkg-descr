libgpod is a shared library to access the contents of an iPod and
optionally iPhone (via `comms/libimobiledevice' library port, enabled
by default).

This code was originally part of gtkpod itself. When the parsing code
was made self-contained with gtkpod v0.93, decision was made to put
this code in a separate library so that other projects can benefit
from it without duplicating code.

libgpod supports playlists, smart playlists, playcounts, ratings,
podcasts, cover art, audio and video. Photo support is implemented as
well. Mono bindings are optionally available too.
