Mp3Splt-project is a utility to split mp3 and ogg files selecting a begin and an
end time position, without decoding. It's very useful to split large mp3/ogg to
make smaller files or to split entire albums to obtain original tracks.  If you
want to split an album, you can select split points and filenames manually or
you can get them automatically from CDDB (internet or a local file) or from .cue
files. Supports also automatic silence split, that can be used also to adjust
cddb/cue splitpoints. You can extract tracks from Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap files in
few seconds. For mp3 files, both ID3v1 & ID3v2 tags are supported.

Mp3splt-project is split in 3 parts : libmp3splt, mp3splt and mp3splt-gtk.
