SpiralLoops is an experimental loop-based sampler for Linux and FreeBSD.

The idea of SpiralLoops is to provide a simple, visual tool for looping
and layering of sounds; which can be sourced from either WAV files on disk,
or from sound-generating plugins.

SpiralLoops allows you to create loop-based compositions with the minimum
feedback time between the decisions you make and your ears.  The looping
mechanism is very flexible; you can lock the timing of loops together, or
offset them for creating complex sequences, such as polyrhythms.

Loop triggers can be used to cause interaction between the loops, and as
an experimental way of creating music.
