mp3lint is a tool to check collections of audio files for various problems. It
is highly configurable, allowing you to specify your preferred format for
filenames, minimum bitrate, tests to ignore, etc.

Formats checked are currently mp3, ogg, wav, flac, au, and m3u playlists.
mp3lint is implemented as separate tools (perl modules), each of which
implements a set of tests. There are a total of 32 different tests.
