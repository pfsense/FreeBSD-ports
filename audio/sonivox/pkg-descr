sonivox is a fork of the Android Open Source Project
'platform_external_sonivox', including a CMake based build system to be used
not on Android, but on any other computer Operating System. Google licensed
this work originally named Sonivox EAS (Embedded Audio Synthesis) from the
company Sonic Network Inc. under the terms of the Apache License 2.0.

This is a Wave Table synthesizer, not using external soundfont files but
embedded samples instead. It is also a real time GM synthesizer. It consumes
very little resources, so it may be indicated in projects for small embedded
devices. There is neither MIDI input nor Audio output facilities included in
the library. You need to provide your own input/output.
