You will need to run the configuration script for xmcd
to accurately recognize your cd-rom.  The configure
script is: %%PREFIX%%/lib/X11/xmcd/config/config.sh

If you would like to submit data to CDDB you will need
to install mail/mailx or add something similar to
the following line in your Xdefaults:
XMcd.cddbMailCmd:  mail -s '%S' %A <%F >/dev/null 2>&1

xmcd and cda are not suid anymore, so if you want
to allow non-root users to use xmcd or cda, either
set the suid bit yourself, or even better, allow
access to /dev/cd0 in /etc/devfs.conf, e.g.

perm      /dev/cd0	   0664
