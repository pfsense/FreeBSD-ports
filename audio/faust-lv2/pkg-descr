This project provides an LV2 plugin architecture for the Faust programming
language. The package contains the Faust architecture and templates for the
needed LV2 manifest (ttl) files, a collection of sample plugins written in
Faust, and a generic GNU Makefile as well as a shell script to compile plugins
using the architecture.

faust-lv2 is free and open source software. The latest source can be found in
the git repository at https://bitbucket.org/agraef/faust-lv2. In the downloads
section of this site you can also find released tarballs along with my faust-lv2
paper for the 2013 Linux Audio Conference. Please use the issue tracker for bug
reports and requests. You're also invited to join one of Grame's Faust mailing
lists to discuss faust-lv2 or Faust in general.
