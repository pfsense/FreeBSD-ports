NymphCast is a software solution which turns your choice of
FreeBSD-capable hardware into an audio and video source for a
television or powered speakers. It enables the streaming of audio
and video over the network from a wide range of client devices,
as well as the streaming of internet media to a NymphCast server,
controlled by a client device, or directly on the receiver.
