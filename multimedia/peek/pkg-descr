Peek makes it easy to create short screencasts of a screen area. It was built
for the specific use case of recording screen areas, e.g. for easily showing
UI features of your own apps or for showing a bug in bug reports. With Peek,
you simply place the Peek window over the area you want to record and press
"Record". Peek is optimized for generating animated GIFs, but you can also
directly record to WebM or MP4 if you prefer.

Peek is not a general purpose screencast app with extended features but rather
focuses on the single task of creating small, silent screencasts of an area of
the screen for creating GIF animations or silent WebM or MP4 videos.

Peek runs on X11 or inside a GNOME Shell Wayland session using XWayland. Support
for more Wayland desktops might be added in the future (see FAQs below).
