Kdenlive is a non-linear video editor for GNU/Linux, OS X and FreeBSD,
which supports DV, AVCHD and HDV editing. Kdenlive relies on several
other open source projects, such as FFmpeg, the MLT video framework
and Frei0r effects. It was designed to answer all needs, from basic
video editing to semi-professional work.
