The Quasar DV codec (libdv) is a software codec for DV video, the
encoding format used by most digital camcorders, typically those
that support the IEEE 1394 (a.k.a. FireWire or i.Link) interface.
Libdv was developed according to the official standards for DV
video: IEC 61834 and SMPTE 314M.

Please note that this software is only concerned with the DV video
compression format, which is different from capturing the data from
a camcorder.
