nostt is a command line reader for NOS Teletekst, the Dutch public teletext
system (like Ceefax in the UK). It supports color and has an interactive mode.

Note that teletext supports 6-cell (2x3) block drawing characters. The NOS
viewer and API use a custom font with these characters in the "private use"
0xF000 Unicode range. Because such characters are not usually available on
terminals, they are replaced by % characaters.
