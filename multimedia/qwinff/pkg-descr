QWinFF is a GUI for FFmpeg, a powerful command-line media converter.  It
provides an intuitive graphical interface and a rich set of presets to
help you use ffmpeg easily without having to type a single command.
Advanced users can also adjust conversion parameters like bitrate and
sample rate in detail.

QWinFF also comes in handy when you need to make a video clip for a
larger video. Starting from version 0.2.0, QWinFF features an
interactive video-cutting interface that lets you watch the video and
select the time range you want to convert. There is also an option that
changes the speed of the video, making it possible to create slow-motion
or fast-motion animations. Audio will also be rescaled without changing
the pitch.
