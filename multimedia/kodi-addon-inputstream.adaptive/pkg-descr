Adaptive stream support for Kodi

This addon adds support for multiple manifest types and is used by
other addons to dynamically select the best audio/video quality/resolution
according to available bandwith.

For example, it is required by the MPEG-DASH functionality of Kodi's
YouTube addon to support video playback in higher resolutions than 720p.
