Bento4 is a C++ class library and tools to read and write ISO-MP4 files.
This format is defined in international specifications ISO/IEC 14496-12,
14496-14 and 14496-15.
The format is a derivative of the Apple Quicktime file format,
so Bento4 can be used to read and write most Quicktime files as well.
