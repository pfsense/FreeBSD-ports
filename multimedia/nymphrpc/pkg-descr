NymphRPC is a compact, C++-based Remote Procedure Call (RPC) library.
Look at the example server and client implementations in the test folder
to get an idea of how NymphRPC is integrated into an application.

The basic procedure is to define the RPC methods and client-side callbacks
in the server, which the client will synchronise with when it connects to
the server. There is no Domain-Specific Language (DSL) or auto-generated code.
