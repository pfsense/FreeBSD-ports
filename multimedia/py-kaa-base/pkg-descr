The Kaa Media Repository is a set of python modules related to
media.

Kaa modules are based on parts from Freevo and modules created for
MeBox. Kaa exists to encourage code sharing between these projects,
and to serve as an umbrella for several previously disparate
media-related modules in order to make them available from one
(unique) namespace.

Kaa provides a base module that implements the common features
needed for application development, such as mainloop management,
timers, signals, callbacks, file descriptor monitors, etc. Kaa's
other modules provide specific media-related functionality, such
as retrieving metadata on arbitrary media files (kaa.metadata,
previously called mmpython), Python wrappers for Imlib2, Xine, and
Evas, and many other high level APIs for easily creating applications
that deal with video and audio.

Kaa is named after the python character in the Jungle Book by Rudyard
Kipling.
