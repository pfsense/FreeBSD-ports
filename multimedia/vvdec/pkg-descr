Versatile Video Coding (VVC) is the most recent international video coding
standard, developed by the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) of the ITU-T Video
Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG).
VVC is the successor of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard and
will be released by ITU-T as H.266 and by ISO/IEC as MPEG-I Part 3
(ISO/IEC 23090-3). The new standard targets a 50% bit-rate reduction over HEVC
at the same visual quality. In addition, VVC proves to be truly versatile by
including tools for efficient coding of video content in emerging applications,
e.g. high dynamic range (HDR), adaptive streaming, computer generated content as
well as immersive applications like 360 degree video and augmented reality (AR).

The Fraunhofer Versatile Video Decoder (VVdeC) is a fast VVC x86 software
decoder implementation. The decoder supports most standard features available in
the Main10 profile, with support for some high-level features still pending.
