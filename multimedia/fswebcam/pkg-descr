fswebcam is a neat and simple webcam app. It captures images from
a V4L1/V4L2 compatible device or file, averages them to reduce noise
and draws a caption using the GD Graphics Library which also handles
compressing the image to PNG or JPEG. The resulting image is saved
to a file or sent to stdio where it can be piped to something like
ncftpput or scp.
