FileBot is the ultimate tool for organizing and renaming your Movies, TV Shows
and Anime as well as fetching subtitles and artwork. It's smart and just works.

FileBot makes organizing your movies and TV shows a breeze! We'll automatically
match your files with information from various online databases.  How you want
your media files to be named and organized is completely up to you. Our groovy
format engine supports pretty much anything!

Fetching subtitles is just as easy, just drop it in! Besides automatic lookup
you'll also be able to manually search and download subtitles, preview subtitles
and fix encoding problems (e.g. force UTF-8).

Use FileBot on the command-line! There is a simple CLI for core tasks like
renaming media files and fetching subtitles as well as checking or creating SFV
files. On top of that you can use our scripting engine to define more complex
automated processing. There's already shared scripts for various tasks that you
can just run right away or further customize to your needs.

Setting up a fully automated media center - extract archives, organize tv shows
and movies, download subtitles, fetch artwork and metadata, update Kodi - with
FileBot it's that easy!
