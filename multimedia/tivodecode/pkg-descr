This software converts a .TiVo file (produced by the TiVoToGo functionality
on recent TiVo software releases) to a normal MPEG file. This has the same
functionality as using TiVo's supplied DirectShow DLL on Windows with a tool
such as DirectShowDump, but is portable to different architectures and
operating systems, and runs on the command line using files or pipes. The
conversion still requires the valid MAK of the TiVo which recorded the file,
so it cannot be used to circumvent their protection, simply to provide the
same level of access as is already available on Windows.
