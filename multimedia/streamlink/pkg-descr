Streamlink is a command-line utility which pipes video streams from various
services into a video player, such as VLC.

The main purpose of Streamlink is to avoid resource-heavy and unoptimized
websites, while still allowing the user to enjoy various streamed content.

There is also an API available for developers who want access to the stream
data.

This project was forked from Livestreamer, which is no longer maintained.
