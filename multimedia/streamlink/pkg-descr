Streamlink is a command-line utility that pipes video streams from various
services into a video player, such as VLC.

The main purpose of Streamlink is to allow the user to avoid buggy and CPU
heavy flash plugins but still be able to enjoy various streamed content.

There is also an API available for developers who want access to the video
stream data.

This project was forked from Livestreamer, which is no longer maintained.
