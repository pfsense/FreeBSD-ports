WARNING: A UK TV licence is required to access BBC iPlayer TV content legally.

You must be in the UK, or use a UK proxy, to gain access to most iPlayer content.

To use the web server cgi script, you must set "get_iplayer_enable="YES" in
"/etc/rc.conf", and set "get_iplayer_chdir" to a valid directory to store
configuration files and downloads. If "get_iplayer_chdir" is unset, the
"get_iplayer" home directory is used.

In the latter case you can set the home directory to (eg) '/home/get_iplayer", with:

pw usermod get_iplayer -m -M 750 -k /var/empty -d /home/get_iplayer
