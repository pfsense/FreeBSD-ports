OGMRip is an application and a set of libraries for ripping and encoding DVD
into DivX/OGM files using a wide variety of codecs. It relies on mplayer,
mencoder, ogmtools, oggenc and lame to perform its tasks.

The GUI features a clean HIG-compliant GNOME 2 interface and tries to minimize
as much as possible esoteric settings.
