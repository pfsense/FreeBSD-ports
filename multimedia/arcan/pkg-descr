Arcan is a powerful development framework for creating virtually anything from
user interfaces for specialized embedded applications all the way to full-blown
standalone desktop environments.

At its heart lies a robust and portable multimedia engine, with a well-tested
and well-documented Lua scripting interface. The development emphasizes
security, debuggability and performance -- guided by a principle of least
surprise in terms of API design.
