  message: <<EOM
The Clutter backend has been removed from the multimedia/xfce4-parole
port, as it induces a crash with Gtk >= 3.22.

If you had manually configured parole to use the Clutter backend, you
must switch to 'xvimagesink' or 'ximagesink'.

You can use the 'xfconf-query' command in order to change the backend:
$ xfconf-query -c parole -p /video/videosink -s "xvimagesink"
You can choose 'xvimagesink' or 'ximagesink'.
Alternatively you can remove previously specified backend:
$ xfconf-query -c parole -p /video/videosink -r
