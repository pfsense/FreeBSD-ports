Plex Media Server is used to host the content and plugins that are then
streamed to Plex Media Center and Plex mobile app clients, either on the
same machine, the same local area network, or over the Internet. Content
may be transcoded by the server before it's streamed in order to reduce
bandwidth requirements, or for compatibility with the device being
streamed to.
