An OBS Studio plugin that provides output capabilities to a Video4Linux2 device.
It is basically a Linux version of obs-virtual-cam, but only contains the video
sink part. You can use it with v4l2loopback to achieve cross-program video
transfer between OBS Studio and third party software supporting Video4Linux2,
e.g. to present an OBS session in proprietary browser-based conferencing systems
by selecting the OBS session as a webcam.
