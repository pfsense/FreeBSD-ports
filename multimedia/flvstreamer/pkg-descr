flvstreamer is an open source command-line RTMP client intended to
stream audio or video content from all types of flash or rtmp
servers. Forked from rtmpdump v1.6 with encrypted rtmp and swf
verification support removed. This tool provides free interoperability
with the previously undocumented adobe RTMP protocol so widely in use
on the internet today. It was developed entirely by reverse
engineering methods and without access to any proprietary or
restrictive-license protocol specifications.
