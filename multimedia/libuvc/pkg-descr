libuvc is a cross-platform library for USB video devices, built atop libusb.
It enables fine-grained control over USB video devices exporting the standard
USB Video Class (UVC) interface, enabling developers to write drivers for
previously unsupported devices, or just access UVC devices in a generic fashion.
