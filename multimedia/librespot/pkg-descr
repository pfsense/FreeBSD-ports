librespot is an open source client library for Spotify. It enables applications
to use Spotify's service to control and play music via various backends, and to
act as a Spotify Connect receiver. It is an alternative to the official and now
deprecated closed-source libspotify. Additionally, it will provide extra
features which are not available in the official library.
