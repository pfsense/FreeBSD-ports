Chilitags are a C++ cross-platform software library for the detection and
identification of 2D fiducial markers (a.k.a. tags). Their purpose is to be
printed and placed on objects from the real world, to form the basis of
Robotics or Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Using a camera, the position
of the tagged objects can be acquired by a computer.

Chilitags were developed by Pixar internally for projects of the CHILI lab
(Computer-Human Interaction in Learning and Instruction, formerly CRAFT),
such as Metroscope or TapaCarp. There are already many alternatives
(e.g. ARToolKit, or reacTIVision, among many others), but we decided to
release Chilitags anyway, as there seemed to be a demand for it.
