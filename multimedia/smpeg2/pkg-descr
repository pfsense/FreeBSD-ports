SMPEG is a free MPEG1 video player library with sound support.  Video playback
is based on the ubiquitous Berkeley MPEG player, mpeg_play v2.2.  Audio is
played through a slightly modified mpegsound library, part of Splay v0.8.2.
SMPEG supports MPEG audio (MP3), MPEG-1 video, and MPEG system streams.

plaympeg is simple video players provided to test the library.  The C library
interface is 'documented' in smpeg.h, and the C++ library interface is spread
out over the MPEG*.h files.

This is a work in progress.  Only 16 or 32 bit color depth is supported.
The player will dynamically convert to other color depths, but playback
will be much faster if your display is already set to 16 bit color depth.
