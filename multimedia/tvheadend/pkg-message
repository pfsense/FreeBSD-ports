For the first start in your /etc/rc.conf:
  tvheadend_enable="YES"
  tvheadend_flags="-C"

As soon as you have set an admin password the second line is not needed
anymore and should be removed.

If you plan to use webcamd you need to add tvheadend to the webcamd group.

  pw usermod tvheadend -G webcamd

Some IPTV channel lists expect ffmpeg on a static path (/usr/bin/ffmpeg)
so either fix the m3u file or add an symlink.

Patches, feedback and help are always welcome!
