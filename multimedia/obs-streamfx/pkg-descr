StreamFX is a plugin to libOBS (OBS Studio, StreamElements OBS Live) that adds
new sources, filters and transitions to give you the ability to drastically
improve your stream and recording setup past what was possible in OBS Studio
until now. Whether it is blurring out a region, moving something in 3D, or
just writing your own shaders as a new transition, source or filter -
StreamFX has it all.
