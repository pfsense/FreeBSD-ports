libNDI is a new NDI cross-platform, open-source library done to interact with
NDI streams.

NDI is a royalty-free but proprietary standard for high quality video delivery
in a low-latency manner. The official NDI SDK is offered for multiple platforms
including Linux but is closed-source. NDI is already very widely used as an IP
video standard while VideoLAN's libndi library aims to offer a free software
solution for decoding NDI video streams.

Libndi is cross-platform and aims to provide a means of interacting with NDI
video streams without relying upon any closed-source components.
