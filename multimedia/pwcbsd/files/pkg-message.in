This port has installed the pwc kernel module.

To load the kernel module immediately, type the following command:

	kldload pwc

If your webcam was already plugged in before the kernel module
was loaded you may have to unplug it first.

To load the kernel module at boot, add the following line to
/boot/loader.conf:

	pwc_load="YES"

CAUTION: If you enabled mmap support in the driver, beware that
unplugging your webcam while it is in use may crash your system.
