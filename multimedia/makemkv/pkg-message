This port doesn't include the MakeMKV GUI as it doesn't work on FreeBSD.

To enable makemkvcon to find a drive on FreeBSD, a part of Linux' sysfs must
be faked. The included script `update-makemkv-drives' creates these faked
sysfs entries and is run automatically after installation. If your hardware
configuration changes, make sure to re-run `update-makemkv-drives'.

If makemkvcon refuses to work as root, check the permissions of
/compat/linux/tmp -- it should be world-writable and sticky. To set these
permissions, use the command

  chmod 1777 /compat/linux/tmp
