.Sh BUGS
On
.Fx Ns ,
.Nm
crashes with a signal 11 (segmentation fault) after finishing its job.
Be aware this might leave a
.Sy .core
file on your file system.
.Sh KNOWN ISSUES
To find optical drives,
.Nm
uses some entries from Linux' sysfs that aren't present on
.Fx .
A script `update-makemkv-drives` is included to fake these entries and is run
automatically on installation.
If your system's configuration changes, you must run this script as root
manually, so new or changed drives can be found.
