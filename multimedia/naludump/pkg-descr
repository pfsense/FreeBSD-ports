Naludump is a tool to delete NALU fill data from h.264 streams embedded into
TS files. The overall file structure isn't modified, only complete TS packets
of NALU fill data are removed.

Naludump contains lots of code of Klaus Schmidinger's VDR, and is based on
cocepts from Marten Richter's Nalustripper.

Usage:
naludump inputfile.ts [outputfile.ts]
