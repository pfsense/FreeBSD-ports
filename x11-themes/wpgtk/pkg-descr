wpgtk is a color-scheme manager with a template system which lets you
create templates from any text file and will replace keywords on it when
you change your theme, delivering high customizing power.

And also, for those who are not into auto-generated color-schemes, you
will be happy to know that wpgtk includes all the preset themes that
pywal does, so that's around 200+ themes to play around with, that you
can also modify to get really readable and cool results!
