An expanded Adwaita-styled companion icon theme, built largely upon
the work of GNOME's Adwaita designers and GNOME Circle apps'
developers, as well as inspiration from the Papirus icon theme
designers, and a touch of tinkering from myself and a few others.

The purpose of this theme is to provide third-party apps with a
consistent look and feel in Gnome Shell.

The goal of MoreWaita is to add to Adwaita, not modify it, and to do
roughly what Breeze does for KDE. This theme does not override any
Adwaita icons, nor any Gnome Circle apps icons, nor icons that
generally fit into the Adwaita paradigm (like Transmission
GTK). Currently, this theme is way less all-inclusive than many
others, but the aim is to be on par with Papirus some day.
