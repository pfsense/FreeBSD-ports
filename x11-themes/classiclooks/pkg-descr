The Xfce Classiclooks theme attempts to rid the Xfce desktop of visual
distractions by providing a more consistent look (buttons, scrollbars,
menus, etc) across older and newer applications.

Blends well with 'elementary Xfce darkER' icon set and 'Noto Sans 9'
fonts.

Based on Ambiance gtk2, Adwaita gtk3, and Greybird xfwm.
