This is a port of pdfchain, a graphical user interface for the PDF Toolkit
(PDFtk). The GUI supports all common features of the command line tool in a
comfortable way.

External Dependencies =====================

The PDF Chain GUI creates a PDFTK command with all required parameters and
starts the PDFTK console program that interprets the parameters and processes
the files. PDFTK must therefore installed at the system and executeable by the
command "pdftk".
