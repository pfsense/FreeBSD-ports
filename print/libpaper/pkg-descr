The paper library and accompanying files are intended to provide a simple
way for applications to take actions based on a system- or user-specified
paper size.

This release is quite minimal, its purpose being to provide really basic
functions (obtaining the system paper name and getting the height and
width of a given kind of paper) that applications can immediately
integrate.
A more complete library, using a capabilities file for papers (giving,
in addition to the size, informations like paper weigth, color, etc)
will be released later.

See the sources for paperconf(1) in src/paper.c for how to use the library.
