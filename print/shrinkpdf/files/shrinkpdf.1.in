.Sh NAME
.Nm shrinkpdf
.Nd A simple wrapper around Ghostscript to reduce the file size of PDFs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar infile
.Op outfile
.Op resolution_in_dpi
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Inspired by some code found in an OpenOffice Python script,
.Nm
feeds a PDF through Ghostscript, which performs lossy recompression
by such methods as downsampling the images to a lower resolution.
The result should be (but not always is) a much smaller file.
.Pp
If invoked without
.Op outfile ,
the shrunk file is written to standard output.
If invoked without
.Op resolution_in_dpi ,
a default resolution of 72 dpi is used.
.Pp
If both
.Op infile
and
.Op outfile
are regular files, the script checks if the shrunk output file is actually
smaller than the input file.
If it is not, it writes a message to stderr and copies the input to output.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Reduce PDF resolution to 72 dpi:
.Dl $ shrinkpdf myfile.pdf >myfile-72dpi.pdf
.Pp
Reduce PDF resolution to 300 dpi:
.Dl $ shrinkpdf myfile.pdf - 300 >myfile-300dpi.pdf
.Pp
Reduce PDF resolution to 150 dpi, specify
.Op outfile :
.Dl $ shrinkpdf myfile.pdf myfile-150dpi.pdf 150
