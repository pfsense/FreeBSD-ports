The CUPS Filters package contains backends, filters and other software
that was once part of the core CUPS distribution but is no longer
maintained by Apple Inc.  In addition it contains additional filters and
software developed independently of Apple, especially filters for the
PDF-centric printing workflow introduced by OpenPrinting and a daemon to
browse Bonjour broadcasts of remote CUPS printers to make these printers
available locally and to provide backward compatibility to the old CUPS
broadcasting and browsing of CUPS 1.5.x and older.
