This is JadeTeX, a TeX backend for Jade.

JadeTeX enables you to produce formatted output of documents written
with the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).  JadeTeX uses
tex to produce Device Independent (DVI) output; from there, you can
produce high quality hardcopy.  JadeTeX also uses pdftex to produce
Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) versions of your documents,
complete with hyperlinks, and suitable for distribution on the World
Wide Web and other media.

To use JadeTex, run your SGML document, its Document Type Definition
(DTD), and its Document Style Semantics and Specification Language
(DSSSL) specification, through jade with the "-t tex" option.  Then,
to produce a DVI file, run

   etex "&jadetex" <file>.tex

To produce a PDF file, run

   pdftex "&pdfjadetex" <file>.tex
