This library provides the ability to create PDF documents using only native
Ruby libraries. There are several demo programs available in the demo/
directory. The canonical documentation for PDF::Writer is "manual.pdf",
which can be generated using bin/techbook (just "techbook" for RubyGem users)
and the manual file "manual.pwd".
