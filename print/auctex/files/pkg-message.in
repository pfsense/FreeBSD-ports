   You should edit the file
`%%PREFIX%%/share/emacs/site-lisp/tex-site.el' to fit your local site.
You do this by looking at the customization section in the beginning
of `%%PREFIX%%/share/emacs/site-lisp/auctex/tex.el' and copy the
definitions that are wrong for your site to `tex-site.el'.  Do *not*
edit `tex.el' directly, or you will have to do all the work over again
when you upgrade AUC TeX.  AUC TeX will not overwrite your old
`tex-site.el' file next time you install, so you will be able to keep
all your customizations.

   You probably want to copy and edit `TeX-printer-list' to contain the
printers available at your site.


Enabling AUC TeX
   You can now tell your users to enable AUC TeX by adding

     (load "auctex.el" nil t t)
     (load "preview-latex.el" nil t t)

to their `~/.emacs' file.
