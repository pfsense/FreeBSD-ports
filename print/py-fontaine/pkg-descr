pyfontaine analyses fonts for their language and character/glyph-set support.

It has a straightforward pythonic set definition format in the internals
directory.

Additional definitions are downloaded from the Extensis, font-config and Unicode
websites during installation, and can be updated without reinstalling.

Adding your own definitions is easy. All files in the internals directory are
auto-detected, so just add definition files there.
