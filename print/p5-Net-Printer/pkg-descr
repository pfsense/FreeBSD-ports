Net::Printer
============

Perl module for directly printing to a print server/printer without
having to create a pipe to either lpr or lp.  This essentially mimics
what the BSD LPR program does by connecting directly to the line
printer printer port (almost always 515), and transmitting the data
and control information to the print server.

Please note that this module only communicates with the BSD Line
Printer Daemon Protocol as described in RFC-1179.  It does not
natively speak to remote print servers via SMB, Apple-Talk or
Netware.  Remote print services running lpsched, such as Sun Solaris
or other Sys V-derived operating systems, will work so long as the
print spoolers are set up to understand the BSD protocol.  Most modern
network-capable laser printers, such as those manufactured by HP and
LexMark, also "speak" BSD.
