PostScript::Simple allows you to have a simple method of writing
PostScript files from Perl. It has graphics primitives that allow lines,
curves, circles, polygons and boxes to be drawn. Text can be added to
the page using standard PostScript fonts.

The images can be single page EPS files, or multipage PostScript files.
The image size can be set by using a recognised paper size ("A4", for
example) or by giving dimensions. The units used can be specified ("mm"
or "in", etc) and are the same as those used in TeX. The default unit is
a bp, or a PostScript point, unlike TeX.
