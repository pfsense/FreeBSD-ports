FPDF is a PHP class which allows to generate PDF files with pure PHP, that is
to say without using the PDFlib library. The advantage is that PDFlib requires
a fee for a commercial usage. F from FPDF stands for Free: you may use it for
any kind of usage and modify it to suit your needs.

FPDF has other advantages: high level functions.
Here is a list of its main features:

    * Choice of measure unit, page format and margins
    * Page header and footer management
    * Automatic page break
    * Automatic line break and text justification
    * Image support (JPEG and PNG)
    * Colors
    * Links
    * TrueType, Type1 and encoding support
    * Page compression

Of course, the generation speed of the document is less than with PDFlib.
However, the performance penalty keeps very reasonable and suits in most
cases, unless your documents are particularly complex or heavy.
