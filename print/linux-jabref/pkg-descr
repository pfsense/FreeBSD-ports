JabRef is an open source bibliography reference manager. The native file
format used by JabRef is BibTeX, the standard LaTeX bibliography format.
As such it can also be considered a BibTeX editor.

Some of its features:

 o Search and fetch references from Medline/PubMed and CiteSeer
 o Search, classify and sort entries in your BibTeX files
 o import and export of references in various formats
 o launch external viewers and insert citations into LyX and Kile
 o automatically generate BibTeX keys
 o customize (add your own) BibTeX fields

This port is based on the portable Linux release of JabRef.
