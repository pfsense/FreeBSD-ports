mftrace is a small Python program that lets you trace a TeX bitmap font into
a PFA or PFB font (A PostScript Type1 Scalable Font) or TTF (TrueType) font.

Scalable fonts offer many advantages over bitmaps, as they allow documents
to render correctly at many printer resolutions. Moreover, Ghostscript can
generate much better PDF, if given scalable PostScript fonts.
