IJS is a relatively new initiative to improve the quality and ease
of use of inkjet printing with Ghostscript. Using IJS, you can add
new drivers, or upgrade existing ones, without recompiling Ghostscript.
All driver authors are encouraged to adapt their drivers for IJS,
and if there is an IJS driver available for your printer, it should
be your first choice.
