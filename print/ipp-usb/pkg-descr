ipp-usb daemon enables driver-less printing and scanning on USB-only
AirPrint-compatible printers and MFPs.  It works by connecting to the device by
USB using IPP-over-USB protocol, and exposing the device to the network,
including DNS-SD (ZeroConf) advertising.  IPP printing, eSCL scanning and web
console are fully supported.
