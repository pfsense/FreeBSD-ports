dvi2tty converts a TeX DVI-file to a format that is appropriate for
terminals and line printers. The program is intended to be used for
preliminary proofreading of TeX-ed documents. By default the output
is directed to the terminal, possibly through a pager (depending on
how the program was installed), but it can be directed to a file or
a pipe.
