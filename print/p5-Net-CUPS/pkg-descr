Net::CUPS is an interface to the Common Unix Printing System API.

Previous versions of this module attempted to provide a Perl interface layer
similar to the C interface of CUPS.  This was fine for power users, but most
people were not looking for this type of interface.

This module has now been converted to use an object oriented paradigm to
facilitate quicker development and ease of use.
