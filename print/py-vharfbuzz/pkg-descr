uharfbuzz is an awesome tool for shaping text in Python. But it wraps the
Harfbuzz C interface quite closely, so still requires you to perform a bunch of
boilerplate operations before you can get on with the shaping. vharfbuzz allows
you a slightly more high-level interface to the text shaping process.
