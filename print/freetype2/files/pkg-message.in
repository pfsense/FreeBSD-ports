The 2.7.x series now uses the new subpixel hinting mode (V40 port's option) as
the default, emulating a modern version of ClearType. This change inevitably
leads to different rendering results, and you might change port's options to
adapt it to your taste (or use the new "FREETYPE_PROPERTIES" environment
variable).

The environment variable "FREETYPE_PROPERTIES" can be used to control the
driver properties. Example:

FREETYPE_PROPERTIES=truetype:interpreter-version=35 \
	cff:no-stem-darkening=1 \
	autofitter:warping=1

This allows to select, say, the subpixel hinting mode at runtime for a given
application.

If LONG_PCF_NAMES port's option was enabled, the PCF family names may include
the foundry and information whether they contain wide characters. For example,
"Sony Fixed" or "Misc Fixed Wide", instead of "Fixed". This can be disabled at
run time with using pcf:no-long-family-names property, if needed. Example:

FREETYPE_PROPERTIES=pcf:no-long-family-names=1

How to recreate fontconfig cache with using such environment variable,
if needed:
# env FREETYPE_PROPERTIES=pcf:no-long-family-names=1 fc-cache -fsv

The controllable properties are listed in the section "Controlling FreeType
Modules" in the reference's table of contents
(%%DOCSDIR%%/reference/index.html, if documentation was installed).
