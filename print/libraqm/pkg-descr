Raqm is a small library that encapsulates the logic for complex text layout
and provide a convenient API.

It currently provides bidirectional text support (using FriBiDi), shaping
(using HarfBuzz), and proper script itemization. As a result, Raqm can
support most writing systems covered by Unicode.
