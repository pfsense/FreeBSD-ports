Hyperlatex is a package that allows you to prepare documents in HTML,
and, at the same time, to produce a neatly printed document from your
input. Unlike some other systems that you may have seen, Hyperlatex is
not a general LaTeX-to-HTML converter. In Hyperlatex's author's eyes,
conversion is not a solution to HTML authoring. A well written HTML
document must differ from a printed copy in a number of rather subtle
ways. He doubts that these differences can be recognized mechanically,
and believes that converted LaTeX can never be as readable as a
document written in HTML.

The basic idea of Hyperlatex is to make it possible to write a
document that will look like a flawless LaTeX document when printed
and like a handwritten HTML document when viewed with an HTML browser.
