The true type fonts HAN NOM A and HAN NOM B have been developed by Chan
Nguyen Do Quoc Bao (Germany), To Minh Tam (USA) and Ni sinh Thien Vien Vien
Chieu (Vietnam). Their work got started in 2001, completed in 2003, and
publicized in 2005. These two true type fonts can be used with WIN-2000 or
WIN-XP and Office XP or Office 2003 to display Han and Nom characters with
code points by the Unicode Standard. Two sets of true type fonts are
available with high and low resolutions.
