LZO is a data compression library which is suitable for data
de-/compression in real-time. This means it favours speed over
compression ratio.

LZO implements a number of algorithms with the following features:
   + Decompression is simple and *very* fast.
   + Requires no memory for decompression.
   + Compression is pretty fast.
   + Requires 64 kB of memory for compression.
   + Allows you to dial up extra compression at a speed cost in the
     compressor. The speed of the decompressor is not reduced.
   + Includes compression levels for generating pre-compressed data
     which achieve a quite competitive compression ratio.
   + There is also a compression level which needs only 8 kB for
     compression.
   + Algorithm is thread safe.
   + Algorithm is lossless.
