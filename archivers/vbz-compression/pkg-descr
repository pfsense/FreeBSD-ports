VBZ Compression uses variable byte integer encoding to compress Oxford
Nanopore signal data.
The performance of VBZ is achieved by taking advantage of the properties of the
raw signal and therefore is most effective when applied to the signal dataset.
Other datasets you may have in your Fast5 files will not be able to take
advantage of the default VBZ settings for compression. VBZ will be used as the
default compression scheme in a future release of MinKNOW.
