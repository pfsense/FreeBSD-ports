Archive::Tar::Wrapper is an API wrapper around the 'tar' command line utility.
It never stores anything in memory, but works on temporary directory structures
on disk instead. It provides a mapping between the logical paths in the tarball
and the 'real' files in the temporary directory on disk.

It differs from Archive::Tar in two ways:
- Archive::Tar::Wrapper doesn't hold anything in memory. Everything is stored on
  disk.
- Archive::Tar::Wrapper is 100% compliant with the platform's tar utility,
  because it uses it internally.
