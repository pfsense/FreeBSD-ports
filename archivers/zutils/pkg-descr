Zutils is a collection of utilities able to deal with any combination
of compressed and non-compressed files transparently. If any given
file, including standard input, is compressed, its decompressed
content is used. Compressed files are decompressed on the fly; no
temporary files are created.

The provided utilities are:
Zcat - Decompresses and copies files to standard output.
Zcmp - Decompresses and compares two files byte by byte.
Zdiff - Decompresses and compares two files line by line.
Zgrep - Decompresses and searches files for a regular expression.
Ztest - Tests integrity of compressed files.
Zupdate - Recompresses files to lzip format.

The supported compressors are bzip2, gzip, lzip, and xz.
