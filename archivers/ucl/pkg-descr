UCL is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.

UCL implements a number of compression algorithms that achieve an excellent
compression ratio while allowing *very* fast decompression. Decompression
requires no additional memory.

UCL is an OpenSource re-implementation of some NRV compression algorithms.
