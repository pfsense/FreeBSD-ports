OpenZL delivers high compression ratios while preserving high speed, a
level of performance that is out of reach for generic compressors.

OpenZL takes a description of your data and builds from it a
specialized compressor optimized for your specific format.

OpenZL consists of a core library and tools to generate specialized
compressors - all compatible with a single universal decompressor. It
is designed for engineers that deal with large quantities of
specialized datasets (like AI workloads for example) and require high
speed for their processing pipelines.
