Unpackerr is an application that runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD and in
Docker. You can use it to watch a download folder and extract new items. The
more common use is to watch starr apps (radarr, sonarr, readarr, lidarr,
whisparr) and extract items they download. It can do both, at the same time
even.
