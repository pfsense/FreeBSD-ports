This is a simple command line implementation of the LZMA compression algorithm
from the LZMA SDK. It uses a raw LZMA format instead of the xz or 7z container
formats, and produces compression ratios that are usually about 25-30% better
than bzip2, and decompression speeds that are about twice as fast. The
disadvantages are higher CPU and RAM requirements for compression.
