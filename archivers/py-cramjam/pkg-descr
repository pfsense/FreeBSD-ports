Extremely thin Python bindings to de/compression algorithms in Rust. Allows for
using algorithms such as Snappy, without any system dependencies.

This is handy when being used in environments like AWS Lambda, where installing
packages like python-snappy becomes difficult because of system level
dependencies.
