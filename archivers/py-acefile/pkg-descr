acefile is an implementation of the ACE archive format.  It is intended to be
used as a library, but also provides a stand-alone unace utility.  As mostly
pure-python implementation, it is significantly slower than native
implementations, but more robust against vulnerabilities.

This implementation supports up to version 2.0 of the ACE archive format,
including the EXE, DELTA, PIC and SOUND modes of ACE 2.0, password protected
archives and multi-volume archives.  It does not support writing to archives.
It is an implementation from scratch, based on the 1998 document titled
"Technical information of the archiver ACE v1.2" by Marcel Lemke, using unace
2.5 and WinAce 2.69 by Marcel Lemke as reference implementations.
