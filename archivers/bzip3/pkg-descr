A better, faster and stronger spiritual successor to BZip2. Features
higher compression ratios and better performance thanks to a order-0
context mixing entropy coder, a fast Burrows-Wheeler transform code
making use of suffix arrays and a RLE with Lempel Ziv+Prediction pass
based on LZ77-style string matching and PPM-style context modeling.
