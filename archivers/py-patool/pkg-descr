Patool is an archive file manager.

Various archive formats can be created, extracted, tested, listed, searched,
repacked and compared with patool. The advantage of patool is its simplicity in
handling archive files without having to remember a myriad of programs and
options.

The archive format is determined by the file(1) program and as a fallback by
the archive file extension.

patool supports 7z (.7z, .cb7), ACE (.ace, .cba), ADF (.adf), ALZIP (.alz),
APE (.ape), AR (.a), ARC (.arc), ARJ (.arj), BZIP2 (.bz2), CAB (.cab),
COMPRESS (.Z), CPIO (.cpio), DEB (.deb), DMS (.dms), FLAC (.flac), GZIP (.gz),
ISO (.iso), LRZIP (.lrz), LZH (.lha, .lzh), LZIP (.lz), LZMA (.lzma),
LZOP (.lzo), RPM (.rpm), RAR (.rar, .cbr), RZIP (.rz), SHN (.shn),
TAR (.tar, .cbt), XZ (.xz), ZIP (.zip, .jar, .cbz) and ZOO (.zoo) archive
formats. It relies on helper applications to handle those archive formats (for
example bzip2 for BZIP2 archives).

The archive formats TAR, ZIP, BZIP2 and GZIP are supported natively and do not
require helper applications to be installed.
