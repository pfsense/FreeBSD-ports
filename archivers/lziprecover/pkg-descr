Lziprecover is a data recovery tool and decompressor for files in the
Lzip compressed data format (.lz).  Lziprecover is able to repair slightly
damaged files, produce a correct file by merging the good parts of two or
more damaged copies, extract data from damaged files, and test integrity
of files.

Lziprecover can remove the damaged members from multimember files, for
example multimember .tar.lz archives.

Lziprecover provides random access to the data in multimember files; it
only decompresses the members containing the desired data.
