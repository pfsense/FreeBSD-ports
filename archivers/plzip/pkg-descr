Plzip is a massively parallel (multi-threaded), lossless data
compressor based on the LZMA algorithm, with very safe integrity
checking and a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2.
Plzip uses the lzip file format; the files produced by plzip are
fully compatible with lzip-1.4 or newer.
