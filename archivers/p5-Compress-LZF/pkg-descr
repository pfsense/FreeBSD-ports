LZF is an extremely fast (not that much slower than a pure memcpy)
compression algorithm. It is ideal for applications where you want to
save some space but not at the cost of speed. It is ideal for
repetitive data as well. The module is self-contained and very small
(no large library to be pulled in). It is also free, so there should
be no problems incorporating this module into commercial programs.
