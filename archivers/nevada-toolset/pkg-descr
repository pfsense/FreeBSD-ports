A small set of open-source tools for manipulating game data files from
various early Command and Conquer games by Westwood Studios, namely:

  - strgen, which converts between a UTF-8 INI file format for easy
    translation and the in game binary string table in an old DOS
    code page

  - makemix, which packs files into MIX archive files

  - unmakemix, which extracts files from MIX archive files
