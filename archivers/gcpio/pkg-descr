GNU cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive.  The
archive can be another file on the disk, a magnetic tape, or a pipe.

GNU cpio supports the following archive formats: binary, old ASCII,
new ASCII, crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old tar, and POSIX.1
tar.  The tar format is provided for compatibility with the tar
program.  By default, cpio creates binary format archives, for
compatibility with older cpio programs.  When extracting from
archives, cpio automatically recognizes which kind of archive it
is reading and can read archives created on machines with a different
byte-order.

Note that this port will install these utilities with a 'g' prefix,
e.g. gcpio, but the texinfo documentation will refer to them without
the 'g' prefix.
