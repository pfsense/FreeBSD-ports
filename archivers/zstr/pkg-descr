The zstr C++ header-only library enables the use of C++ standard iostreams to
access ZLib-compressed streams.

For input access (decompression), the compression format is auto-detected, and
multiple concatenated compressed streams are decompressed seamlessly.

For output access (compression), the only parameter exposed by this API is the
compression level.
