C-Blosc2 is the new major version of C-Blosc, and is backward compatible with
both the C-Blosc1 API and its in-memory format. Python-Blosc2 is a Python
package that wraps C-Blosc2, the newest version of the Blosc compressor.

Currently Python-Blosc2 already reproduces the API of Python-Blosc, so it can be
used as a drop-in replacement. However, there are a few exceptions for a full
compatibility.

In addition, Python-Blosc2 aims to leverage the new C-Blosc2 API so as to
support super-chunks, multi-dimensional arrays (NDArray), serialization and
other bells and whistles introduced in C-Blosc2. Although this is always and
endless process, we have already catch up with most of the C-Blosc2 API
capabilities.

Note: Python-Blosc2 is meant to be backward compatible with Python-Blosc data.
That means that it can read data generated with Python-Blosc, but the opposite
is not true (i.e. there is no forward compatibility).
