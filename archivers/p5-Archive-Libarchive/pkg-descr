Archive::Libarchive provides a Perl object-oriented interface to the libarchive
library. The libarchive library is the API used to implemnt bsdtar, the default
tar implementation on a number of operating systems, including FreeBSD, macOS
and Windows. It can also be installed on most Linux distributions. But wait,
there is more, libarchive supports a number of formats, compressors and filters
transparently, so it can be a useful when used as a universal
archiver/extractor.
