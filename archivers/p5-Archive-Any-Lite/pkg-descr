Archive::Any::Lite is a fork of Archive::Any. The main difference is this works
properly even when you fork(), and may require less memory to extract a tarball.
On the other hand, this isn't pluggable (this only supports file formats used in
the CPAN toolchains), and this doesn't check mime types (at least as of this
writing).
