This is the set of GNU shar utilities.  This port installs them
with the letter "g" prepended to their names, to avoid conflict
with the FreeBSD base system.  The uudecode and uuencode commands
are omitted (BSD versions are present in the base system).  The
shar utilities deal with shar files, so-called shell archives, which
are scripts suitable for transmission by e-mail or Usenet.

When a shar file is executed, the files it contains are unpacked
without the need for any software other than the shell itself and
sed.  Because they are scripts, shell archives from strangers should
be read before executing them, to check for harmful commands.
