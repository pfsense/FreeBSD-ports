In addition to the manpages, see %%DOCSDIR%%/readme_*.txt
and the comments at the head of %%DOCSDIR%%/*.cpp
for instructions and details on usage and the algorithms employed.  For
simplicity, the ".exe" suffix has been dropped from the zpsfx
self-expanding archive stub executable, to avoid confusion with win32
executable stubs.  zpsfx can be further compressed with archivers/upx,
to yield smaller self-expanding archives.
