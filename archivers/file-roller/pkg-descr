File Roller is an archive manager for the GNOME environment.  It is only a
front-end (a graphical interface) to archiving programs like tar and zip.
The supported file types are:

* Tar archives uncompressed (.tar) or compressed with gzip (.tar.gz , .tgz),
  bzip (.tar.bz , .tbz), bzip2 (.tar.bz2 , .tbz2), compress (.tar.Z , .taz),
  lzop (.tar.lzo , .tzo)
* Zip archives (.zip)
* Jar archives (.jar , .ear , .war)
* Lha archives (.lzh)
* Rar archives (.rar)
* Single files compressed with gzip, bzip, bzip2, compress, lzop

Former WinZip users may find this program useful.  It serves the same purpose.
