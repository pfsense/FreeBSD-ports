Tartest reads a tar archive from stdin
and checks this archive for compliance with POSIX.1-1990.

As tartest is limited to tests the data that is delivered by the tar
archiver that is going to be checked, it cannot tests if the tar
archiver in question will produce correct archives under all
circumstances.  There may be borderline cases that trigger bugs in the
tar archiver.

This port also contains the various test scripts belonging to
archivers/star.
