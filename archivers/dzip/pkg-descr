Dzip is a program for file compression.  It's advantage over more popular
compression software is in the size of the program, easily fitting on a
floppy disk.

It performs just as good as the competition, or slightly better, on average,
both in compression ratio and time.

Dzip's original purpose was to compress demo recordings of the id Software
game Quake much better than any other program, and it still does!
