UrBackup is an easy to setup Open Source client/server backup system,
that through a combination of image and file backups accomplishes
both data safety and a fast restoration time.

File and image backups are made while the system is running without
interrupting current processes.

UrBackup also continuously watches folders you want backed up in
order to quickly find differences to previous backups. Because of
that, incremental file backups are really fast.

Your files can be restored through the web interface, via the client or the
Windows Explorer while the backups of drive volumes can be restored with a
bootable CD or USB-Stick (bare metal restore).

A web interface makes setting up your own backup server really easy.
