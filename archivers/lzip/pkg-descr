Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the one
of gzip or bzip2.  Lzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip and compresses
more than bzip2, which makes it well suited for software distribution and
data archiving.  Lzip is a clean implementation of the LZMA algorithm.

The lzip file format is designed for long-term data archiving.  It is
clean, provides very safe four factor integrity checking, and is backed
by the recovery capabilities of lziprecover.
