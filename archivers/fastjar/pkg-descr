Fastjar is a version of Sun's `jar' utility, written entirely in C, and
therefore quite a bit faster.  Fastjar can be up to 100x faster than the
stock `jar' program running without a JIT.  Currently, the author is
working on adding all the features present in the Sun utility.  At the
moment, implemented features are:

  * Archive creation
  * Verbose/quiet output
  * stdout vs. file output
  * Manifest file support
  * Deflation or storage
  * Changing to directory and adding files (-C)
  * Archive content listing (-t)
  * Archive extraction (-x)
