Monaco  KOI8-U  Cyrillic fonts for X11  systems in BDF format.  Total of
five bitmap fonts.

This  port  installs  PCF  versions  of  the  fonts  and  generates  the
fonts.alias file, which provides, for the koi8-u and koi8-r encodings --
some applications have the encodings  (such as koi8-r) harcoded in them,
but koi8-u is a superset of koi8-r.
