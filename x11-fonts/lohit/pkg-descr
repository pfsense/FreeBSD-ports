In 2004, Red Hat has released five Indian language fonts as open source
licensed under the GPL. In 2011 Red Hat relicensed fonts under SIL OFL 1.1
license. The fonts named Lohit which means Red in Sanskrit. Currently, the
font family supports 21 Indian languages: Assamese, Bengali, Devanagari
(Hindi, Kashmiri, Konkani, Maithili, Marathi, Nepali, Sindhi, Santali,
Bodo, Dogri), Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Manipuri, Oriya, Punjabi,
Tamil, and Telugu. Now, Fedora Project and its contributors took the
responsibility to consolidate the further efforts and improvements of
the Lohit fonts.

Lohit Fonts are Unicode 6.0 compatible.
