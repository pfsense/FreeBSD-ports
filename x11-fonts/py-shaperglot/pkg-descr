Shaperglot is a library and a utility for testing a font's language support. You
give it a font, and it tells you what languages are supported and to what
degree.

Most other libraries to check for language support (for example, Rosetta's
wonderful hyperglot library) do this by looking at the Unicode codepoints that
the font supports. Shaperglot takes a different approach.
