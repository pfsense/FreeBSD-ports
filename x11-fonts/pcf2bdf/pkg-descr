Pcf2bdf is a font de-compiler. It converts X fonts from Portable
Compiled Format (PCF) to Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF). It can
also accept a compressed/gzipped PCF file as input, but gzip must
be found in your PATH.

FONTBOUNDINGBOX in a BDF file is not used by bdftopcf, so pcf2bdf
generates irresponsible values.
