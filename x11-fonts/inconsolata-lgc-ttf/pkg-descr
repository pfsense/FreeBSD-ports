Inconsolata is one of the most suitable fonts for programmers created by Raph
Levien.  Since the original Inconsolata does not contain Cyrillic alphabet,
it was slightly inconvenient for quite a few programmers from Russia.

Inconsolata LGC is a modified version of Inconsolata with added the Cyrillic
alphabet which directly descends from Inconsolata Hellenic supporting modern
Greek.
