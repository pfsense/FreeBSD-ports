Bitstream Cyberbit is a TrueType font. It is an international font, containing
characters from many languages. Each character is encoded with its Unicode
value, according to Unicode 2.0 standards.

Cyberbit was developed by Bitstream to provide Unicode Consortium members with
a test font. It is therefore distributed freely to customers that need advanced
multilingual fonts for testing and other non-commercial uses. Customers that
wish to use Cyberbit for other purposes must license the font from Bitstream.
