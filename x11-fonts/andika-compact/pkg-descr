Andika is a sans-serif font family designed and optimized especially for
literacy use. It supports almost the complete range of Unicode characters for
these scripts, including a comprehensive range of diacritics and a large set of
symbols useful for linguistics and literacy work.

This compact variant has been created with TypeTuner Web, by setting the "Line
spacing" feature to "Tight", and will not be able to be TypeTuned again.
