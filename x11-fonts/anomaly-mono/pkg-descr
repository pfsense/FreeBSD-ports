Unique monospaced programming font, inspired by "retrofuturism".
The alphabetical characters of the font are designed as an homage
to the aesthetic of older science fiction movies and magazines,
while the numerical characters are intended to mimic digital clock
numbers. Symbols and numbers were given special design consideration
to stand out from alphabetical characters as well. The result is a
font that creates a strong distinction between all types of glyphs
and has a unique appearance, while still maintaining perfect
legibility for writing and debugging code.
