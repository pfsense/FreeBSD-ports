Gohufont is a monospace bitmap font well suited for programming and terminal
use. It is intended to be very legible and offers very discernable glyphs for
all characters, including signs and symbols.

The small 11 px version is perfect for laptops and netbooks as it enables to
fit more text into their small screens. The 14 px is ideal for desktop screens
where you sit farther away from it and the 11 px would be too small.
