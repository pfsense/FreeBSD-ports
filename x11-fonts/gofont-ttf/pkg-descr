The Go font family includes proportional- and fixed-width faces in
normal, bold, and italic renderings.  The fonts have been tested
for technical uses, particularly programming.  Go source code looks
particularly good when displayed in Go fonts, as its name implies, with
things like punctuation characters easily distinguishable and operators
lined up and placed consistently.
