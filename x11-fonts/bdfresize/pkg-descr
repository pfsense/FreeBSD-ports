bdfresize - a tool for resizing BDF format font

Bdfresize is a command to magnify or reduce fonts which are described
with the standard BDF format.  If bdf-file is not specified, it reads
from stdin.  Bdfresize outputs the result to stdout in BDF format.  Some
COMMENT lines are inserted to the result font.  FONT name is modified
depending on the resize factor if the name is described in XLFD format.
SIZE, FONTBOUNDINGBIX, SWIDTH, DWIDTH, BBX and some property lines are
also modified.  Other lines are copied from source.  If a syntax error
occurs in a source font, bdfresize notices it and stops the whole
process.

Bdfresize is a free software under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License version 2. See the COPYING file for details.

Hiroto Kagotani <kagotani@cs.titech.ac.jp> made the original version
(1.4).
