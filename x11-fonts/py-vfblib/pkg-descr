vfbLib is a converter and deserializer for FontLab Studio 5 VFB files.

FontLab's own vfb2ufo converter is from 2015, only outputs UFO v2, and contains
serious bugs that are never going to be fixed. Its support on macOS is subject
to Apple's mercy (no native support for Apple Silicon).

That's why a single determined programmer with a hex editor set out to rectify
this situation.
