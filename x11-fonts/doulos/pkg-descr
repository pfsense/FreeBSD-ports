Doulos SIL is a Unicode-based font family that attempts to provide a
comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any Roman- or
Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or orthographic
needs. In addition, there is provision for other characters and symbols useful
to linguists. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font technologies to
support complex typographic issues, such as the need to position arbitrary
combinations of base glyphs and diacritics optimally.

Doulos is very similar to Times/Times New Roman, but only has a single face-
regular. It is intended for use alongside other Times-like fonts where a range
of styles (italic, bold) are not needed.
