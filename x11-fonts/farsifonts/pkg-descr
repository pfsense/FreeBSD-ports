FarsiWeb.ir has released the first standard set of Unicode Persian fonts ever
published, including Elham, Terafik, Terafik Bold, Titr, Roya, Roya Bold,
Koodak, Nazli, Nazli Bold, and Homa.
The main advantage over legacy fonts is compliance with the Unicode, ISIRI
6219, and OpenType standards, and the addition of required but missing glyphs
for Persian information processing. The fonts are highly recommended if you
care for proper Persian display on your computers.
