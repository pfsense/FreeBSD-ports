Oxygen Font is a project to design a desktop/gui font for integrated
use with the KDE Plasma desktop.

The basic concept for Oxygen Font is to design a clear, legible,
sans serif font which would be rendered with Freetype on Linux-based
devices. In addition a bold weight, plus regular and bold italics,
and a monospace version will be made.
