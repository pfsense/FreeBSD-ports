Recent Ghostscript versions come with a new set of URW fonts that
have additional support for the Greek and Cyrillic scripts (thus
superseding the fonts contained in the 'urw-fonts' port).  Ghostscript
distributes the URW fonts in Type1 format; in addition to these
files, this port also contains the corresponding Type1 metrics files
(AFM), together with TrueType (TTF) and OpenType (OTF) versions of
the fonts.
