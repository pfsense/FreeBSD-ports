ufolint is a source file linter for typeface development in Unified Font Object
(UFO) source code. It was designed for continuous integration testing of UFO
source contributions to typeface projects.

The application performs a UFO version specific static analysis of the source
text files against the UFO v2 and v3 specifications for issues.

These tests are performed through a combination of public methods in the
fontTools.ufoLib library and additional tests that are implemented in the
ufolint application. ufolint catches exceptions raised in the ufoLib public read
methods for all *.plist file types and all ufoLib validations performed on
*.glif files. These are returned to users with informative error messages that
indicate the filepath(s) of concern and exit status code 1.
