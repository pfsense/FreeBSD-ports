Datalegreya is a typeface which can interweave data curves with text. It is
designed by Figs, on the basis of open source font Alegreya Sans SC Thin by type
designer Juan Pablo Del Peral.

Datalegreya can be used in all contexts where small space is available to
synthetically display graphical data: connected objects, embedded displays,
annual reports, weather report, stock prices, etc. It doesn't need any
specialized software: users just have to install it in the operating system and
launch any software able to display OpenType fonts. Standards compliance makes
it equally available on the web or software embedded.

A tool that helps to create datatypography is available at
