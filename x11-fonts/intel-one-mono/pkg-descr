Intel One Mono is an expressive monospaced font family that's built with
clarity, legibility, and the needs of developers in mind.

Identifying the typographically underserved low-vision developer audience,
Frere-Jones Type designed the Intel One Mono typeface in partnership with the
Intel Brand Team and VMLY&R, for maximum legibility to address developers'
fatigue and eyestrain and reduce coding errors. A panel of low-vision and
legally blind developers provided feedback at each stage of design.
