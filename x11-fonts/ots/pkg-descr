The OpenType Sanitizer (OTS) parses and serializes OpenType files (OTF, TTF) and
WOFF and WOFF2 font files, validating them and sanitizing them as it goes.

The C library is integrated into Chromium and Firefox, and also simple command
line tools to check files offline in a Terminal.

The CSS font-face property is great for web typography. Having to use images in
order to get the correct typeface is a great sadness; one should be able to use
vectors.
