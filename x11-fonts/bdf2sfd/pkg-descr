bdf2sfd is a BDF to SFD converter, allowing to vectorize bitmap fonts. It works
by converting each pixel of a glyph to a polygon, which produces large and
unoptimized SFD files that should be post-processed using FontForge.

It was originally created to generate OpenType versions of Spleen. It works best
on fonts proportional to 8x16. Other sizes will work but the aspect ratio will
not be preserved.
