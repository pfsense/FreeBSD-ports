Hermit is a monospace font designed to be clear, pragmatic and very
readable.  Its creation has been focused on programming.  Every
glyph was carefully planned and calculated, according to defined
principles and rules.  For this reason, Hermit is coherent and
regular.

Symbols stand out from common text.  Dots and commas are easily
seen, and operators are clear even when not surrounded by spaces.
Similar characters have been designed to be very distinguishable
from each other.
