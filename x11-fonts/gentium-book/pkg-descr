”Gentium” is a Latin word meaning belonging to the nations. The
Gentium typeface family was created to enable the diverse ethnic
groups—nations—around the world who use the Latin, Cyrillic, or Greek
scripts to produce readable, high-quality publications. It supports
almost the complete range of Unicode characters for these scripts,
including a comprehensive range of diacritics and a large set of
symbols useful for linguistics and literacy work.

Gentium’s design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably
compact, and visually attractive. One design strategy for greater
readability is to make slightly more generous counters, which are the
spaces inside and around the strokes of the letters. For compactness,
capital letters are modest in size and slightly compressed. For
attractiveness, Gentium combines good design with careful
letterspacing, plus a friendly, calligraphic character.
