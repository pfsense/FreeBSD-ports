This is a patched Xserver with a KDrive backend that uses the
arcan-shmif to map Xlib/Xcb/X clients to a running Arcan instance.

It currently works as a 'desktop in a window', where you supply the
window manager and so on, and use the X side as normal. Some Arcan
features will be lost, particularly any customizations done to the
keybindings - normal X controls for defining keyboard maps and
overrides are needed.
