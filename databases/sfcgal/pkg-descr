SFCGAL is a C++ wrapper library around CGAL with the aim of supporting ISO
19107:2013 and OGC Simple Features Access 1.2 for 3D operations.

SFCGAL provides standard compliant geometry types and operations, that can be
accessed from its C or C++ APIs. PostGIS uses the C API, to expose some
SFCGAL's functions in spatial databases
