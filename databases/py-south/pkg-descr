This is South, intelligent schema migrations for Django apps.

South is:

    * Intelligent; it knows if you've missed out a migration or two
    * Database independent, so there's no hassle if you need to move databases.
    * Easy; it can write migrations for you, and it takes about a minute to
      convert your app over to use South.
    * Designed for a pluggable Django world; you can declare dependencies
      between apps so they all migrate together correctly, and you can still
      use syncdb for your non-migrated apps without it interfering.
    * Useful for data too; you can write migrations to transform legacy data.
    * Better (we think, anyway) than the alternatives.
