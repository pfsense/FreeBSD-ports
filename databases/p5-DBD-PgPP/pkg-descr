DBD::PgPP is a Pure Perl client interface for the PostgreSQL database.
It implements the PostgreSQL client/server network protocol and doesn't
need an external PostgreSQL client library like "libpq" for it to work.
Consequently, it allows one to connect to a PostgreSQL server from
operating systems to which PostgreSQL has not been ported.
