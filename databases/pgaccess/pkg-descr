PgAccess is a pretty GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the open source
database PostgreSQL.

PgAccess is a cross-platform database management tool for PostgreSQL, written in
Tcl/Tk. There are active efforts to turn it into a tool for writing applications
that can work in a distributed client-server model (a central PostgreSQL
database and remote clients).

PgAccess was originally written by Constantin Teodorescu using Visual Tcl,
"the best tool for developing Tcl/Tk applications I've ever seen."
It is currently managed by the developers at BSDforge.com.
