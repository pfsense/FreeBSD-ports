QDBM is a library of routines for managing a database.  The database
is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and
a value.  Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length.
Both binary data and character string can be used as a key and a
value.  There is neither concept of data tables nor data types.
Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.
