iODBC (intrinsic Open Database Connectivity) is an ODBC driver manager that
is compatible with the ODBC 2.x and 3.x specifications.  It performs the
standard tasks of a driver manager, i.e. driver loading, parameter and
function sequence checking, driver function invocation, etc.

Applications linked with the iODBC driver manager will be able - through ODBC
function calls - to access simultaneously different types of data sources
within one process through suitable ODBC drivers.

iODBC is freely redistributable under either the GNU Library General Public
Licence (LGPL) or the BSD licence.
