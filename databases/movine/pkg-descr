Movine is a simple database migration manager that aims to be compatible with
real-world migration work. Many migration managers get confused with
complicated development strategies for migrations. Oftentimes migration managers
do not warn you if the SQL saved in git differs from what was actually run on
the database. Movine solves this issue by keeping track of the unique hashes for
the up.sql and down.sql for each migration, and provides tools for fixing
issues. This allows users to easily keep track of whether their local migration
history matches the one on the database.
