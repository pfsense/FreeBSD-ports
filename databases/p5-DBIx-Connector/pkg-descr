DBIx::Connector provides a simple interface for fast and safe DBI
connection and transaction management.  Connecting to a database can
be expensive; you don't want your application to re-connect every time
you need to run a query.  The efficient thing to do is to hang on to a
database handle to maintain a connection to the database in order to
minimize that overhead.  DBIx::Connector lets you do that without
having to worry about dropped or corrupted connections.
