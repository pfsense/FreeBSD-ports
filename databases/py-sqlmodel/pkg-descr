SQLModel is a library for interacting with SQL databases from Python
code, with Python objects. It is designed to be intuitive, easy to
use, highly compatible, and robust.

SQLModel is based on Python type annotations, and powered by Pydantic
and SQLAlchemy.

The key features are:
- Intuitive to write: Great editor support. Completion
  everywhere. Less time debugging. Designed to be easy to use and
  learn. Less time reading docs.
- Easy to use: It has sensible defaults and does a lot of work
  underneath to simplify the code you write.
- Compatible: It is designed to be compatible with FastAPI, Pydantic,
  and SQLAlchemy.
- Extensible: You have all the power of SQLAlchemy and Pydantic
  underneath.
- Short: Minimize code duplication. A single type annotation does a
  lot of work. No need to duplicate models in SQLAlchemy and Pydantic.
