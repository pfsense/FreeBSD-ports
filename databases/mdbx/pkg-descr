libmdbx is an extremely fast, compact, powerful, embedded, transactional
key-value database, with permissive license. libmdbx has a specific set of
properties and capabilities, focused on creating unique lightweight solutions.

Historically, libmdbx is a deeply revised and extended descendant of the
amazing Lightning Memory-Mapped Database. libmdbx inherits all benefits from
LMDB, but resolves some issues and adds a set of improvements.
