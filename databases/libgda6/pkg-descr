Libgda is a (relatively small) database access library:
* it is a wrapper like ODBC but with more features to access several
  database engines
* features a meta data extractor (to know all about database objects
  in a common way)
* comes with an SQL console application (like mysql, psql or sqlite3 consoles)
* relies on GLib, coded in C, its API is easy to use
