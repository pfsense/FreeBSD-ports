This plugin makes it very easy to create Dancer2 applications that
interface with databases. It automatically exports the keyword `schema`
which returns a DBIx::Class::Schema object. You just need to configure
your database connection information. For performance, schema objects
are cached in memory and are lazy loaded the first time they are accessed.
