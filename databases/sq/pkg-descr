sq is a command-line tool that provides jq-style access to structured data
sources including SQL databases and document formats like CSV, Excel, and JSON.

Key features:

- Query multiple database types (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, etc.)
- Cross-source joins between different databases and file formats
- Multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, Excel, HTML, XML, Markdown)
- Database inspection and schema comparison
- SQL execution with syntax highlighting
- Data import/export between sources

sq simplifies working with structured data by providing a unified interface
for querying and transforming data across various sources.
