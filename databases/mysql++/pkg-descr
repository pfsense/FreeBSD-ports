MySQL++ is a C++ wrapper for the MySQL and MariaDB C APIs. It is built on the
same principles as the Standard C++ Library to make dealing with the database
as easy as dealing with std containers. MySQL++ lets you avoid the most
repetitive sorts of SQL by providing native C++ interfaces for these common
tasks.
