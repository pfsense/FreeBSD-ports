A massively distributed, transactional key-value store, extensible by
design, with unparalleled reliability and performance.

FoundationDB is multi-model, meaning you can store many types of data in a
single database. All data is safely stored, distributed, and replicated
in the Key-Value Store component. It is easy to install, grow, and
manage, with a distributed architecture that gracefully scales out, and
handles faults while acting like a single ACID database. FoundationDB
provides amazing performance on commodity hardware, allowing you to
support very heavy loads at low cost. It has been running in production
for years and been hardened with lessons learned in some of the world's
largest database deployments. Backing FoundationDB up is an unmatched
testing system based on a deterministic simulation engine that ensures
optimal reliability of operations.
