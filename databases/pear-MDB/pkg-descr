PEAR MDB is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase php database abstraction layers.
It provides a common API for all support RDBMS. The main difference to most
other DB abstraction packages is that MDB goes much further to ensure
portability.

Currently supported RDBMS are MySQL, PostGreSQL, Oracle, Frontbase, Querysim,
Interbase/Firebird, and MSSQL
