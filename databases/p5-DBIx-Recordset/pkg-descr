DBIx::Recordset is a perl module for abstraction and simplification of
database access.

The goal is to make standard database access
(select/insert/update/delete) easier to handle and independend of the
underlying DBMS.  Special attention is made on web applications to make
it possible to handle the state-less access and to process the posted
data of formfields, but DBIx::Recordset is not limited to web
applications.
