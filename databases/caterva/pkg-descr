Caterva is a C library for handling multi-dimensional, compressed datasets in an
easy and convenient manner. It implements a thin metalayer on top of C-Blosc2
for specifying not only the dimensionality of a dataset, but also the
dimensionality of the chunks inside the dataset. In addition, Caterva adds
machinery for retrieving arbitrary multi-dimensional slices (aka hyper-slices)
out of the multi-dimensional containers in the most efficient way. Hence,
Caterva brings the convenience of multi-dimensional and compressed containers to
your application very easily.
