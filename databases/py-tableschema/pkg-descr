Table Schema is a simple language- and implementation-agnostic way to declare a
schema for tabular data. Table Schema is well suited for use cases around
handling and validating tabular data in text formats such as CSV, but its
utility extends well beyond this core usage, towards a range of applications
where data benefits from a portable schema format.

Features:
- Table to work with data tables described by Table Schema
- Schema representing Table Schema
- Field representing Table Schema field
- validate to validate Table Schema
- infer to infer Table Schema from data
- built-in command-line interface to validate and infer schemas
- storage/plugins system to connect tables to different storage backends like
  SQL Database
