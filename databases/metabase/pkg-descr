Metabase is an open source business intelligence tool. It lets you ask
questions about your data and displays answers in formats that
make sense, whether that's a bar graph or a detailed table.

Your questions can be saved for later, making it easy to come back to them,
or you can group questions into great looking dashboards. Metabase also
makes it easy to share questions and dashboards with the rest of your team.
