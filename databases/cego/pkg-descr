Cego is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). Cego
supports transactional SQL query requests in a multithreaded
architecture. For high availability requirements, Cego supports a
database shadowing feature. Several compute nodes can be defined in
a Cego database configuration, where each node is able to manage a
number of so called table sets. For each tableset, a backup node
can be defined, which runs is recover mode for the corresponding
tableset. If required, the tableset can be switched to the backup
node and this node gets the active node for the tableset.
