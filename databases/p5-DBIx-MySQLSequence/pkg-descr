The DBIx::MySQLSequence package implements an emulation layer that
provides "real" sequences on MySQL. The module works by creating a
"sequence table", a single table where each record represents a
single sequence, and performing some "magic" MySQL specific SQL to
ensure the sequences will work correctly.
