Imposm is an importer for OpenStreetMap data. It reads PBF files and
imports the data into PostgreSQL/PostGIS. It can also automatically
update the database with the latest changes from OSM.

It is designed to create databases that are optimized for rendering
(i.e. generating tiles or for WMS services).
