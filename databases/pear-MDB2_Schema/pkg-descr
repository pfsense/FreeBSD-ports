PEAR::MDB2_Schema enables users to maintain RDBMS independant schema
files in XML that can be used to create, alter and drop database entities
and insert data into a database. Reverse engineering database schemas from
existing databases is also supported. The format is compatible with both
PEAR::MDB and Metabase.
