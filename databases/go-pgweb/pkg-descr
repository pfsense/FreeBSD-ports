Pgweb is a web-based database browser for PostgreSQL, written in Go and works on
OSX, Linux and Windows machines. Main idea behind using Go for backend
development is to utilize ability of the compiler to produce zero-dependency
binaries for multiple platforms. Pgweb was created as an attempt to build very
simple and portable application to work with local or remote PostgreSQL
databases.
