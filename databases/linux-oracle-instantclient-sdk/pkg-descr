Oracle instant client - Software Development Kit  distribution

Instant Client allows you to run your applications without installing
the standard Oracle client or having an ORACLE_HOME.  OCI, OCCI, ODBC,
and JDBC applications work without modification, while using
significantly less disk space than before.  Even SQL*Plus can be used
with Instant Client.  No recompile, no hassle.
