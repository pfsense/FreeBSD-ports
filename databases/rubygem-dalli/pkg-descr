Dalli is a high performance pure Ruby client for accessing memcached servers. It
works with memcached 1.4+ only as it uses the newer binary protocol. It should
be considered a replacement for the memcache-client gem.

The name is a variant of Salvador Dali for his famous painting The Persistence
of Memory.
