Mango is a pure-Perl non-blocking I/O MongoDB driver, optimized for use with
the Mojolicious real-time web framework, and with multiple event loop support.
Since MongoDB is still changing rapidly, only the latest stable version is
supported.

Many arguments passed to methods as well as values of attributes get serialized
to BSON with Mango::BSON, which provides many helper functions you can use to
generate data types that are not available natively in Perl. All connections
will be reset automatically if a new process has been forked, this allows
multiple processes to share the same Mango object safely.
