Oryx is an object persistence framework which supports both object-relational
mapping as well as DMB style databases and as such is not coupled with any
particular storage back-end. In other words, you should be able to
swap out an RDMBS with a DBM style database (and vice versa) without
changing your persistent classes at all.
