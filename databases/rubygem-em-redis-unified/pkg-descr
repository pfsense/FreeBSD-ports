An EventMachine based library for interacting with the very cool Redis data
store by Salvatore 'antirez' Sanfilippo. Modeled after eventmachine's
implementation of the memcached protocol, and influenced by Ezra Zygmuntowicz's
redis-rb library (distributed as part of Redis).

This library is only useful when used as part of an application that relies on
Event Machine's event loop. It implements an EM-based client protocol, which
leverages the non-blocking nature of the EM interface to achieve significant
parallelization without threads.
