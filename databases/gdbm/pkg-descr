The GNU dbm is a library of database functions that use extensible hashing
and works similar to the standard UNIX dbm functions.  These routines are
provided to a programmer needing to create and manipulate a hashed database.

This library exists in the FreeBSD base collection, but the GNU version has
added functionality that is sometimes useful.
