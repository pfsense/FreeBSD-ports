pgtop was inspired by mytop (http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/mytop/),
which in turn was inspired by the system monitoring tool top.
pgtop will connect to a PostgreSQL server and periodically
run queries against the pg_stat* relations and attempt
to summarize the information from them in a useful format.
