The PuppetDB CLI project provide Puppet subcommands for querying PuppetDB data,
via `puppet query <query>`, and PuppetDB administrative tasks, `puppet db
<import|export|status>`.

The query subcommand will allow you to query PuppetDB using either the upcoming
PQL syntax of the traditional PuppetDB query syntax (also known as AST).

The db subcommand is a replacement for the older puppetdb <export|import>
commands with faster startup times and much friendlier error messages.
