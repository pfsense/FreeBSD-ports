A little tool that will display dBase III files.  You can also use
it to convert your old .dbf files for further use with Unix. It should
also work with dBase IV files, but this is mostly untested.

dbview displays the contents of a dBase III or IV database file.  This is
done by displaying both the name of the field itself and its value.  At
the end of every record a newline is appended.
