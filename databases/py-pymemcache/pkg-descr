A comprehensive, fast, pure-Python memcached client.

pymemcache supports the following features:

 * Complete implementation of the memcached text protocol.
 * Configurable timeouts for socket connect and send/recv calls.
 * Access to the "noreply" flag, which can significantly increase the speed of
   writes.
 * Flexible, modular and simple approach to serialization and deserialization.
 * The (optional) ability to treat network and memcached errors as cache
   misses.
