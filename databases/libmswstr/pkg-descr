When using Microsoft Jet 4 Databases, index fields are created using
the DBLCMapStringW function (check MSDN library for documentation of
this function).
Jet 4 driver itself loads this function from mswstr.dll on Microsoft
Windows. The library contains static translation tables (as opposed to
LCMapStringW API) in order to have consistent translations across all
Windows Versions.

Libraries that try to read and parse mdb file indices like
databases/mdbtools should work on every platform and therefore a
platform independent version of this library is needed. This is an
attempt to port the library to Posix-systems.
