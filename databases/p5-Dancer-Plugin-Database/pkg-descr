Dancer::Plugin::Database provides an easy way to obtain a connected DBI database
handle by simply calling the database keyword within your Dancer application.

Returns a Dancer::Plugin::Database::Handle object, which is a subclass of DBI's
DBI::db connection handle object, so it does everything you'd expect to do with
DBI, but also adds a few convenience methods. See the documentation for
Dancer::Plugin::Database::Handle for full details of those.
