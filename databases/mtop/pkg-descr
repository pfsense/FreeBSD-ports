mtop (MySQL top) monitors a MySQL server showing the queries which are taking
the most amount of time to complete. Features include 'zooming' in on a process
to show the complete query, 'explaining' the query optimizer information for a
query and 'killing' queries. In addition, server performance statistics,
configuration information, and tuning tips are provided.

mkill (MySQL kill) monitors a MySQL server for long running queries and kills
them after a specified time interval. Queries can be selected based on regexes
on the user, host, command, database, state and query.
