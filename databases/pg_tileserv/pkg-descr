pg_tileserv is a PostGIS-only tile server written in Go. By restricting itself
to only using PostGIS as a data source, pg_tileserv gains the following
features:

- Automatic configuration. The server can discover and automatically publish
as tiles sources all tables it has read access to: just point it at a
PostgreSQL/PostGIS database.
- Full SQL flexibility. Using function layers, the server can run any SQL to
generate tile outputs. Any data processing, feature filtering, or record
aggregation that can be expressed in SQL, can be exposed as parameterized tile
sources.
- Database security model. You can restrict access to tables and functions
using standard database access control. This means you can also use advanced
access control techniques, like row-level security to dynamically filter
access based on the login role.
