KeyDB is a high performance fork of Redis with a focus on multithreading,
memory efficiency, and high throughput. In addition to performance
improvements, KeyDB offers features such as Active Replication, FLASH
Storage and Subkey Expires. KeyDB has a MVCC architecture that allows you
to execute queries such as KEYS and SCAN without blocking the database and
degrading performance.

KeyDB maintains full compatibility with the Redis protocol, modules, and
scripts. This includes the atomicity guarantees for scripts and transactions.
Because KeyDB keeps in sync with Redis development KeyDB is a superset of
Redis functionality, making KeyDB a drop in replacement for existing Redis
deployments.

On the same hardware KeyDB can achieve significantly higher throughput than
Redis. Active-Replication simplifies hot-spare failover allowing you to
easily distribute writes over replicas and use simple TCP based load
balancing/failover. KeyDB's higher performance allows you to do more on less
hardware which reduces operation costs and complexity.
