pylibmc is a client in Python for memcached. It is a wrapper around
TangentOrg's libmemcached library.

The interface is intentionally made as close to python-memcached as possible,
so that applications can drop-in replace it.

pylibmc leverages among other things configurable behaviors, data pickling,
data compression, battle-tested GIL retention, consistent distribution, and
the binary memcached protocol.
