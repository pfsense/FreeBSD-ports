fakeredis is a pure Python implementation of the redis-py python client that
simulates talking to a redis server. This was created for a single purpose: to
write unittests. Setting up redis is not hard, but many times you want to write
unittests that do not talk to an external server (such as redis). This module
now allows tests to simply use this module as a reasonable substitute for redis.
