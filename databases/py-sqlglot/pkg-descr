SQLGlot is a no dependency Python SQL parser, transpiler, and optimizer. It can
be used to format SQL or translate between different dialects like DuckDB,
Presto, Spark, and BigQuery. It aims to read a wide variety of SQL inputs and
output syntactically correct SQL in the targeted dialects.

It is a very comprehensive generic SQL parser with a robust test suite. It is
also quite performant while being written purely in Python.

You can easily customize the parser, analyze queries, traverse expression trees,
and programmatically build SQL.

Syntax errors are highlighted and dialect incompatibilities can warn or raise
depending on configurations.
