Mojo::Pg is a tiny wrapper around DBD::Pg that makes PostgreSQL a lot of fun to
use with the Mojolicious real-time web framework.

Database handles are cached automatically, so they can be reused transparently
to increase performance. And you can handle connection timeouts gracefully by
holding on to them only for short amounts of time.
