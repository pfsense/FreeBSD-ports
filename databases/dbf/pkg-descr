dbf is an easy-to-use command line tool to show and convert the content of
dBASE III, IV, and 5.0 files. It reads dBASE databases and prints the content
to the screen or converts it to comma-separated (*.csv) files which can be
opened in Excel, StarOffice, and most other spread sheets. It can also be
used to show some statistics about the content.
