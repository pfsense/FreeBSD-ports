The Cache::Memcached::Managed module provides an API to values, cached in
one or more memcached servers.  Apart from being very similar to the API
of Cache::Memcached, the Cached::Memcached::Managed API allows for
management of groups of values, for simplified key generation and expiration,
as well as version and namespace management and a few other goodies.
