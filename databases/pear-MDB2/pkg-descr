PEAR MDB2 is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase php database abstraction
layers.

It provides a common API for all supported RDBMS. The main difference to most
other DB abstraction packages is that MDB2 goes much further to ensure
portability. MDB2 provides most of its many features optionally that can be used
to construct portable SQL statements.
