LeoFS is a highly scalable, fault-tolerant distributed file system
for the Web.

LeoFS provides High Cost Performance Ratio. It allows you to build
LeoFS clusters using commodity hardware. LeoFS will require a smaller
cluster than other storage to achieve the same performance. LeoFS is
also very easy to setup and to operate.

LeoFS provides High Reliability thanks to its great design on top of
the Erlang/OTP capabilities. LeoFS system will stay up regardless of
software errors or hardware failures happening inside the cluster.

LeoFS provides High Scalability. Adding and removing nodes is simple
and quick, allowing you to react swiftly when your needs change. A
LeoFS cluster can be thought as elastic storage that you can stretch
as much and as often as you need.
