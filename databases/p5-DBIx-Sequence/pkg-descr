DBIx::Sequence - A simple SQL92 ID generator

his module is intended to give easier portability to Perl database
application by providing a database independant unique ID generator.
This way, an application developer is not bound to use his database's
SEQUENCE or auto_increment thus making his application portable on
multiple database environnements.

This module implements a simple Spin Locker mechanism and is garanteed
to return a unique value every time it is called, even with concurrent
processes. It uses your database for its state storage with ANSI SQL92
compliant SQL. All SQL queries inside DBIx::Sequence are pre cached and
very efficient especially under mod_perl.
