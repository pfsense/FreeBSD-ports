If this is the first time you are installing %%PORTNAME%%, you will need
to add a default administrator, and initialise the database node.

If you are upgrading an existing %%PORTNAME%% installation < 2.0, you will
need to replicate your databases across with HTTP, and manually apply
any security objects and local.ini settings.

If you are upgrading from 2.0 and newer,  you can simply re-use the
existing database and views directory, amending your local.ini file
accordingly:

[couchdb]
uuid = ....
database_dir = /var/db/couchdb/data
view_index_dir = /var/db/couchdb/views

In both cases, make sure your javascript functions are compliant with
modern JS, as the SpiderMonkey 60 engine is more strict than its
predecessors used in older CouchDB versions.

For a single node setup, append an inital administrator username and
password to the [admins] section of your local.ini, and a [log] section:

[admins]
admin = passwd
[log]
# http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/config/logging.html
level = err
include_sasl = true
writer = syslog
syslog_host = localhost

Amend %%ETCDIR%%/vm.args as required, at least altering the cookie.

Then, start Apache CouchDB, and run the following commands once the
database is started for the first time, amending admin:passwd to match
your choice above to initialise the default databases:

sudo service %%PORTNAME%% start

curl -X PUT http://admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_users
curl -X PUT http://admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_replicator
curl -X PUT http://admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_global_changes

Then use the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/# as usual.
