Libodbc++ aims to be a complete C++ development environment for data source
(typically SQL database) access.  It exists in the form of a class library
and a set of tools.  Libodbc++ currently provides a subset of the JDBC 2.0
specification functionality.

Libodbc++ runs on top of ODBC, i.e. it needs to be compiled with support for
an ODBC driver manager.  It currently supports either iODBC or unixODBC.
This port allows the user to select which driver manager to use via a
build-time variable definition - see the comments in the Makefile for further
details.
