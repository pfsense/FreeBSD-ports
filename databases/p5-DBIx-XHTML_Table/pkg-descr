XHTML_Table will execute SQL queries and return the results (as a
scalar 'string') wrapped in XHTML tags.

This module was created to fill a need for a quick and easy way to
create 'on the fly' XHTML tables from SQL queries for the purpose
of 'quick and dirty' reporting. It is not intended for serious
production use, although it use is viable for prototyping and just
plain fun.
