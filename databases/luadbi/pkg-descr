LuaDBI is a database interface library for Lua.  It's designed to provide
an RDBMS agnostic API for handling database operations.  It also provides
support for prepared statement handles, placeholders, and bind parameters
for all database operations.

On FreeBSD, LuaDBI supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite3 databases with
native database drivers.
