This PostgreSQL extension implements a Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) for OGR.

Please note that this version of ogr_fdw works with PostgreSQL 9.3+, and
have some limitations:
	Only non-spatial query restrictions are pushed down to the OGR driver.
	Spatial restrictions are not pushed down.
	OGR connections every time.
	All columns are retrieved every time.
