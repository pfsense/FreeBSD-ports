dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same
practices that software engineers use to build applications.

Analysts using dbt can transform their data by simply writing select statements,
while dbt handles turning these statements into tables and views in a data
warehouse.

These select statements, or "models", form a dbt project. Models frequently
build on top of one another - dbt makes it easy to manage relationships between
models, and visualize these relationships, as well as assure the quality of your
transformations through testing.
