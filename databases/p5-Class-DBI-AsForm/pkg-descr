This module helps to generate HTML forms for creating new database
rows or editing existing rows. It maps column names in a database
table to HTML form elements which fit the schema. Large text fields
are turned into textareas, and fields with a has-a relationship to
other Class::DBI tables are turned into select drop-downs populated
with objects from the joined class.
