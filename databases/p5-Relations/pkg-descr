This perl library contains functions for dealing with databases.  It's
mainly used as the foundation for all the other Relations modules. It
may be useful for people that deal with databases in Perl as well.

Relations has functions for creating SQL clauses (like where, from etc.)
from hashes, arrays and strings. It also has functions for converting
strings to arrays or hashes, if they're not hashes or arrays already. It
even has an argument parser, which is used quite heavily by the other
Relations modules.
