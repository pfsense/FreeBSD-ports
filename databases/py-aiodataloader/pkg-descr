DataLoader is a generic utility to be used as part of your application's data
fetching layer to provide a simplified and consistent API over various remote
data sources such as databases or web services via batching and caching.

A port of the "Loader" API originally developed by @schrockn at Facebook in 2010
as a simplifying force to coalesce the sundry key-value store back-end APIs
which existed at the time. At Facebook, "Loader" became one of the
implementation details of the "Ent" framework, a privacy-aware data entity
loading and caching layer within web server product code. This ultimately became
the underpinning for Facebook's GraphQL server implementation and type
definitions.

Asyncio DataLoader is a Python port of the original JavaScript DataLoader
implementation. DataLoader is often used when implementing a GraphQL service,
though it is also broadly useful in other situations.
