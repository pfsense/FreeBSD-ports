This Template Toolkit plugin module provides an interface to the Perl
DBI/DBD modules, allowing you to integrate SQL queries into your
template documents.  It also provides an interface via the Tie::DBI
module (if installed on your system) so that you can access database
records without having to embed any SQL in your templates.
