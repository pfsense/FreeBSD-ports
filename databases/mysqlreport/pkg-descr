mysqlreport makes a friendly report of important MySQL status values.
mysqlreport transforms the values from SHOW STATUS into an easy-to-read
report that provides a much more in-depth understanding of how well
MySQL is running. For this and many other reasons, mysqlreport is
a better alternative (and practically the only alternative) to
manually interpreting SHOW STATUS.
