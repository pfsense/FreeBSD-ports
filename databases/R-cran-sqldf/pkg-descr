The sqldf() function is typically passed a single argument which is an SQL
select statement where the table names are ordinary R data frame names. sqldf()
transparently sets up a database, imports the data frames into that database,
performs the SQL select or other statement and returns the result using a
heuristic to determine which class to assign to each column of the returned
data frame. The sqldf() or read.csv.sql() functions can also be used to read
filtered files into R even if the original files are larger than R itself can
handle. 'RSQLite', 'RH2', 'RMySQL' and 'RPostgreSQL' backends are supported.
