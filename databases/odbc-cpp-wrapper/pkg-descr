odbc-cpp-wrapper is an object-oriented C++-wrapper of the ODBC API. It takes
care of
- managing the lifetime of ODBC resources,
- allocating and managing resources needed for ODBC operations and
- converting ODBC errors to exceptions and throwing them.

The odbc-cpp-wrapper API attempts to make usage of ODBC as simple as possible.
The API was designed to make wrong usage almost impossible and to ensure proper
object lifetime management.

odbc-cpp-wrapper was originally developed for exchanging spatial data with
databases. It focuses on batch operations of variable-sized data, which is not
very well supported by other ODBC wrappers.
