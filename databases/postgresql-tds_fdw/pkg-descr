Tds_fdw is a PostgreSQL foreign data wrapper that can connect to databases that
use the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol, such as Sybase databases and
Microsoft SQL server.

This foreign data wrapper requires a library that implements the DB-Library
interface, such as FreeTDS. This has been tested with FreeTDS, but not the
proprietary implementations of DB-Library.

The current version does not yet support JOIN push-down, or write operations.

It does support WHERE and column pushdowns when match_column_names is enabled.
