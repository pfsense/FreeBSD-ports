The DBIx::SQLEngine class provides an extended interface for the DBI
database framework. Each SQLEngine object is a wrapper around a DBI
database handle, adding methods that support ad-hoc SQL generation and
query execution in a single call. Dynamic subclassing based on database
server type enables cross-platform portability.
