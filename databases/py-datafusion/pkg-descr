This is a Python library that binds to Apache Arrow in-memory query engine
DataFusion.

DataFusion's Python bindings can be used as a foundation for building new data
systems in Python. Here are some examples:
- Dask SQL uses DataFusion's Python bindings for SQL parsing, query planning,
  and logical plan optimizations, and then transpiles the logical plan to Dask
  operations for execution.
- DataFusion Ballista is a distributed SQL query engine that extends
  DataFusion's Python bindings for distributed use cases.
- DataFusion Ray is another distributed query engine that uses DataFusion's
  Python bindings.
