RRD::Simple provides a simple interface to RRDTool's RRDs module. This module
does not currently offer fetch method that is available in the RRDs module.

It does however create RRD files with a sensible set of default RRA (Round
Robin Archive) definitions, and can dynamically add new data source names to an
existing RRD file.

This module is ideal for quick and simple storage of data within an RRD file if
you do not need to, nor want to, bother defining custom RRA definitions.
