LMDB_File is a Perl wrapper around the OpenLDAP's LMDB (Lightning
Memory-Mapped Database) C library.

LMDB is an ultra-fast, ultra-compact key-value data store developed
by Symas for the OpenLDAP Project. See http://symas.com/mdb/ for details.

LMDB_File provides full access to the complete C API, a thin Perl wrapper
with an Object-Oriented interface and a simple Perl's tie interface
compatible with others DBMs.
