This is the client and protocol library for the Drizzle project.
The server, drizzled, will use this as for protocol library. Client
utilities and any new projects that require low-level protocol
communication (like proxies). Other language interfaces (PHP
extensions, Python DBI, Perl DBD, SWIG, ...) should be built off
of this library.
