dbt-duckdb

DuckDB is an embedded database, similar to SQLite, but designed for OLAP-style
analytics. It is crazy fast and allows you to read and write data stored in CSV,
JSON, and Parquet files directly, without requiring you to load them into the
database first.

dbt is the best way to manage a collection of data transformations written in
SQL or Python for analytics and data science. dbt-duckdb is the project that
ties DuckDB and dbt together, allowing you to create a Modern Data Stack In A
Box or a simple and powerful data lakehouse with Python.
