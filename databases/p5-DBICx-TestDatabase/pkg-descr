The Perl 5 module DBICx::TestDatabase creates a temporary SQLite
database, deploys your DBIC schema, and then connects to it. This
lets you easily test your DBIC schema. Since you have a fresh
database for every test, you don't have to worry about cleaning up
after your tests, ordering of tests affecting failure, etc.
