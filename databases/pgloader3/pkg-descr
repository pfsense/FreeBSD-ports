pgloader loads data from various sources into PostgreSQL. It can transform the
data it reads on the fly and submit raw SQL before and after the loading.
It uses the COPY PostgreSQL protocol to stream the data into the server,
and manages errors by filling a pair of reject.dat and reject.log files.

Thanks to being able to load data directly from a database source, pgloader
also supports migrations from other productions to PostgreSQL. In this mode of
operation, pgloader handles both the schema and data parts of the migration in a
single unmanned command, allowing to implement Continuous Migration.
