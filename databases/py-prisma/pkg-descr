Prisma Client Python is a next-generation ORM built on top of Prisma
that has been designed from the ground up for ease of use and
correctness.

Prisma is a TypeScript ORM with zero-cost type safety for your
database, although don't worry, Prisma Client Python interfaces with
Prisma using Rust, you don't need Node or TypeScript.

Prisma Client Python can be used in any Python backend
application. This can be a REST API, a GraphQL API or anything else
that needs a database.
