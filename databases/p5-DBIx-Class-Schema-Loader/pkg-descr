DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader automates the definition of a
DBIx::Class::Schema by scanning database table definitions and setting
up the columns, primary keys, and relationships.

DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader currently supports only the DBI storage
type. It has explicit support for DBD::Pg, DBD::mysql, DBD::DB2, and
DBD::SQLite. Other DBI drivers may function to a greater or lesser
degree with this loader, depending on how much of the DBI spec they
implement, and how standard their implementation is. Patches to make
other DBDs work correctly welcome.

See DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader::DBI::Writing for notes on writing your
own vendor-specific subclass for an unsupported DBD driver.

This module requires DBIx::Class 0.06 or later, and obsoletes the older
DBIx::Class::Loader.

This module is designed more to get you up and running quickly against
an existing database, or to be effective for simple situations, rather
than to be what you use in the long term for a complex database/project.
