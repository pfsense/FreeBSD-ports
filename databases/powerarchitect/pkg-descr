[ excerpt from developer's www site ]

The Power*Architect is a user-friendly data modeling tool created by data
warehouse designers, and has many unique features geared specifically for the
data warehouse architect. It allows users to reverse-engineer existing
databases, perform data profiling on source databases, and auto-generate ETL
metadata.

Plus, the Power*Architect has the ability to take snapshots of database
structures, allowing users to design DW data models while working offline.
