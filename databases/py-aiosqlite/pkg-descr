aiosqlite allows interaction with SQLite databases on the main AsyncIO event
loop without blocking execution of other coroutines while waiting for queries
or data fetches. It does this by using a single, shared thread per connection.
This thread executes all actions within a shared request queue to prevent
overlapping actions.

Connection objects are proxies to the real connections, contain the shared
execution thread, and provide context managers to handle automatically closing
connections. Cursors are similarly proxies to the real cursors, and provide
async iterators to query results.
