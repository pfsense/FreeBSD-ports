AnyEvent::CouchDB is a non-blocking CouchDB client implemented on top of the
AnyEvent framework. Using this library will give you the ability to run many
CouchDB requests asynchronously, and it was intended to be used within a
Coro+AnyEvent environment. However, it can also be used synchronously if you
want.

Its API is based on jquery.couch.js, but we've adapted the API slightly so that
it makes sense in an asynchronous Perl environment.
