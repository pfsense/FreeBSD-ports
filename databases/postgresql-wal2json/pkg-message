You need to set up at least two parameters in postgresql.conf:

	wal_level = logical
	#
	# these parameters only need to set in versions 9.4, 9.5 and 9.6
	# default values are ok in version 10 or later
	#
	max_replication_slots = 10
	max_wal_senders = 10

After changing these parameters, a restart is needed.
