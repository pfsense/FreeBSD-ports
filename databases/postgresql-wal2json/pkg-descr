wal2json is an output plugin for logical decoding. It means that the plugin have
access to tuples produced by INSERT and UPDATE. Also, UPDATE/DELETE old row
versions can be accessed depending on the configured replica identity.
Changes can be consumed using the streaming protocol (logical replication slots)
or by a special SQL API.
