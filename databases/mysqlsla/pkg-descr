mysqlsla analyzes general, slow, and raw MySQL statement logs.
mysqlsla can read multiple MySQL general and slow logs (and logs
containing raw SQL statements), combine them, then run various
analyses on all the queries.  In addition, mysqlsla can correlate
the analyses so that the queries in one analysis are used as the
basis for subsequent analyses.  Other options include limiting the
output of each analysis to the top N queries, averaging execution
time over N runs, customizing the order in which the analyses are
ran, statement filtering, statement pattern matching, and
mysqldumpslow-like formatting.
