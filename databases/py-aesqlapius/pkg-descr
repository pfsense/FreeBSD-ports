So you don't want to use ORM, and want to organize your SQL queries
in a convenient way. Don't mix them with your python code, don't
write `execute` and `fetchrow`s by hand for each query. With
aesqlapius:

- Store your SQL queries separate from the code, in a dedicated
  file or directory hierarchy
- Annotate each query with python-like function definition specifying
  input arguments and output types and patterns

aesqlapius builds a class out of this, where you can call your
queries as plain methods. It handles arguments (pass positional
or keyword arguments as you like, default values are also handled) and
output types and patterns (you may specify whether a method returns
iterator, list, dict of rows, or a single row, where row may
be represented as a tuple, list, dict, single value or a custom
type such as a dataclass).
