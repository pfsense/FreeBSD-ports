Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The
database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a
key and a value. Every key and value is serial bytes with variable
length. Both binary data and character string can be used as a key and
a value. Each key must be unique within a database. There is neither
concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash
table or B+ tree.

Kyoto Cabinet runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store one
million records is 0.9 seconds for hash database, and 1.1 seconds for
B+ tree database. Moreover, the size of database of Kyoto Cabinet is
very small. For example, overhead for a record is 16 bytes for hash
database, and 4 bytes for B+ tree database. Furthermore, scalability
of Kyoto Cabinet is great. The database size can be up to 8EB (9.22e18
bytes).

Kyoto Cabinet is written in the C++ language, and provided as API of
C++, C, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, and Lua. Kyoto Cabinet is available
on platforms which have API conforming to C++03 with the TR1 library
extensions. Kyoto Cabinet is a free software licensed under the GNU
