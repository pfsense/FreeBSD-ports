LuaSQLite3 is a thin wrapper around the public domain SQLite3
database engine.

LuaSQLite3 provides a means to manipulate SQLite3 databases
directly from Lua using Lua 5.

There are two modules, identical except that one links SQLite3
dynamically, the other statically.

The module `lsqlite3` links SQLite3 dynamically.

The module `lsqlite3complete` links SQLite3 statically.
