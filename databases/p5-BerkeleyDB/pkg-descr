This is the perl5 interface to Berkeley DB version 2, 3, 4 or 4.1, which
it depends on.

You may want to use this, instead of the default dbm that perl provides,
as that one is based on version 1, which is seriously buggy. E.g., if
keys or data are over a hundred bytes or so, bad things may happen to
your dbm files. Never mind all the extra features....
