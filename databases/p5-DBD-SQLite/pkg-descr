DBD::SQLite
===========

SQLite is a small fast embedded SQL database engine.

DBD::SQLite embeds that database engine into a DBD driver, so if
you want a relational database for your project, but don't want
to install a large RDBMS system like MySQL or PostgreSQL, then
DBD::SQLite may be just what you need.

It supports quite a lot of features, such as transactions (atomic
commit and rollback), indexes, DBA-free operation, a large subset
of SQL92 supported, and more.
