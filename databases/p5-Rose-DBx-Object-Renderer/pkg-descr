Rose::DBx::Object::Renderer generates web UIs for Rose::DB::Object.
It encapsulates many web conventions in the generated UIs as default
behaviours. For example, email addresses are by default rendered as
mailto links in tables and appropiate validation is enforced
automatically in forms. These behaviours are highly extensible.

Renderer uses CGI::FormBuilder to generate forms and the Google Chart
API to render charts. Template::Toolkit is used for template processing,
however, Renderer can dynamically generate a full set of UIs without
any templates.
