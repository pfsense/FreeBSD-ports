SnowDDL is a declarative-style tool for object management automation in
Snowflake.

It is not intended to replace other tools entirely, but to provide an
alternative approach focused on practical data engineering challenges.

You may find SnowDDL useful if:

- complexity of object schema grows exponentially, and it becomes hard to manage
- your organization maintains multiple Snowflake accounts (dev, stage, prod)
- your organization has multiple developers sharing the same Snowflake account
  and suffering from conflicts
- it is necessary to generate some part of configuration dynamically using
  Python
