MyDumper is a MySQL Logical Backup Tool. It has 2 tools:
- mydumper which is responsible to export a consistent backup of MySQL databases
- myloader reads the backup from mydumper, connects the to destination database
  and imports the backup. Both tools use multithreading capabilities

Why do we need MyDumper?
- Parallelism (hence, speed) and performance (avoids expensive character set
  conversion routines, efficient code overall)
- Easier to manage output (separate files for tables, dump metadata, etc, easy
  to view/parse data)
- Consistency - maintains snapshot across all threads, provides accurate master
  and slave log positions, etc
- Manageability - supports PCRE for specifying database and tables inclusions
  and exclusions
