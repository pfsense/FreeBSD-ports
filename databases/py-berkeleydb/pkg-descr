This module provides a nearly complete wrapping of the Oracle/Sleepycat C API
for the Database Environment, Database, Cursor, Log Cursor, Sequence and
Transaction objects, and each of these is exposed as a Python type in the
berkeleydb.db module. The database objects can use various access methods:
btree, hash, recno, queue and heap. Complete support of Oracle Berkeley DB
distributed transactions. Complete support for Oracle Berkeley DB Replication
Manager. Complete support for Oracle Berkeley DB Base Replication.

Please see the documents in the docs directory of the source distribution or at
the website for more details on the types and methods provided. The goal is to
mirror most of the real Oracle Berkeley DB API so fall back to the Oracle
Berkeley DB documentation as appropriate.
