Speed tables is a high-performance memory-resident database, currently oriented
towards Tcl.  Speed tables provides an interface for defining tables containing
zero or more rows, with each row containing one or more fields. The speed table
compiler reads the table definition and generates C code to create and manage
corresponding structures, generating a custom C language Tcl extension to
create, access and manipulate those tables and building a native code package
in a shared library that is loadable on demand via Tcl's "package require"
mechanism.
