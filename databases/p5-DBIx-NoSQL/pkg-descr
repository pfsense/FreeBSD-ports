DBIx::NoSQL is a layer over DBI that presents a NoSQLish way to store and
retrieve data. It does this by using a table called __Store__. Once connected
to a database, it will detect if this table is missing and create it if
necessary.

When writing data to the store, the data (a HASH reference) is first
serialized using JSON and then inserted/updated via DBIx::Class to (currently)
an SQLite backend.

Retrieving data from the store is done by key lookup or by searching an
SQL-based index. Once found, the data is deserialized via JSON and returned.
