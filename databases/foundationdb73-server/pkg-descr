FoundationDB is a distributed database designed to handle large volumes of
structured data across clusters of commodity servers. It organizes data as an
ordered key-value store and employs ACID transactions for all operations. It is
especially well-suited for read/write workloads but also has excellent
performance for write-intensive workloads. Users interact with the database
using API language binding.
