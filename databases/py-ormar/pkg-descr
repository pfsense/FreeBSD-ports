The ormar package is an async mini ORM for Python, with support for Postgres,
MySQL, and SQLite.

The main benefit of using ormar are:
* getting an async ORM that can be used with async frameworks (fastapi,
  starlette etc.)
* getting just one model to maintain - you don't have to maintain pydantic and
  other orm model (sqlalchemy, peewee, gino etc.)

The goal was to create a simple ORM that can be used directly (as request and
response models) with fastapi that bases it's data validation on pydantic.
