DB Browser for SQLite is a light GUI editor for SQLite databases,
built on top of Qt. The main goal of the project is to allow
non-technical users to create, modify and edit SQLite databases
using a set of wizards and a spreadsheet-like interface.

This project has previous been known as "SQLite Browser" and "Database
Browser for SQLite". "DB Browser for SQLite" will hopefully be the
name that sticks. :)
