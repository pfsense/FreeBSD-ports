Firebird 3 was installed.

1) Before start the server ensure that the following line exists in /etc/services:

gds_db		3050/tcp  #InterBase Database Remote Protocol

2) If you use inetd (Classic Server) then add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf

gds_db  stream  tcp     nowait  firebird        %%PREFIX%%/sbin/firebird  firebird

And finally restart inetd.

3) If you want to use change firebird modes then you must modify the ServerMode
   variable into %%ETCDIR%%/firebird.conf file.

 ServerMode="Super"
 # ServerMode="SuperClassic"
 # ServerMode="Classic"

4) It is STRONGLY recommended that you change the SYSDBA
password with:

 # gsec -user SYSDBA -pass masterkey
 GSEC> modify SYSDBA -pw newpassword
 GSEC> quit

before doing anything serious with Firebird.

5) See documentation in %%DOCSDIR%%/ for more information.

6) Some firebird tools were renamed for avoid conflicts with some other ports

	%%PREFIX%%/bin/isql	-> 	%%PREFIX%%/bin/isql-fb
	%%PREFIX%%/bin/gstat	->	%%PREFIX%%/bin/fbstat
	%%PREFIX%%/bin/gsplit	->	%%PREFIX%%/bin/fbsplit

6) Enjoy it ;)
