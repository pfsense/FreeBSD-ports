This class provides application developers with an abstraction class
a level away from DBI, that allows them to write an application
that works on multiple database platforms. The idea isn't to take
away the responsibility for coding different SQL on different
platforms, but to simply provide a platform that uses the right
class at the right time for whatever DB is currently in use.
