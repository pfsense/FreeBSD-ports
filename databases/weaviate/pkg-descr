Weaviate is an open-source, cloud-native vector database that stores both
objects and vectors, enabling semantic search at scale. It combines vector
similarity search with keyword filtering, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), and reranking in a single query interface. Common use cases include
RAG systems, semantic and image search, recommendation engines, chatbots,
and content classification.
