The python-rrdtool provides an interface to rrdtool, the
wonderful graphing and logging utility. This wrapper
implementation has worked from the scratch (without SWIG),
and it's under LGPL.

The bindings are based on the code of the original Python 2
bindings module for rrdtool by Hye-Shik Chang and are now
shipped with the RRDtool distribution. This project is
maintained separately to provide a more pythonic way to
install those bindings via PyPI.
