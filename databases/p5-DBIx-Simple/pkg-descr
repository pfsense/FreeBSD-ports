DBIx::Simple module aims to be a simplified object oriented interface to Perl
DBI.  From its description ...

  Query preparation and execution are combined in a single method, the result
  object (which is a wrapper around the statement handle) provides easy
  row-by-row and slurping methods.

  The "query" method returns either a result object, or a dummy object.  The
  dummy object returns undef (or an empty list) for all methods and when used in
  boolean context, is false. The dummy object lets you postpone (or skip) error
  checking, but it also makes immediate error check simply " $db->query(...) or
  die $db->error".
