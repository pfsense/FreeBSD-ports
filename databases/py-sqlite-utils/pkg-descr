Python CLI utility and library for manipulating SQLite databases.

Some feature highlights

* Pipe JSON (or CSV or TSV) directly into a new SQLite database
  file, automatically creating a table with the appropriate schema
* Run in-memory SQL queries, including joins, directly against data
  in CSV, TSV or JSON files and view the results
* Configure SQLite full-text search against your database tables
  and run search queries against them, ordered by relevance
* Run transformations against your tables to make schema changes
  that SQLite ALTER TABLE does not directly support, such as
  changing the type of a column
* Extract columns into separate tables to better normalize your
  existing data
