dwave-system is a basic API for easily incorporating the D-Wave system as a
sampler in the D-Wave Ocean software stack, directly or through Leap's
cloud-based hybrid solvers. It includes DWaveSampler, a dimod sampler that
accepts and passes system parameters such as system identification and
authentication down the stack, LeapHybridSampler, for Leap's hybrid solvers,
and other. It also includes several useful composites - layers of pre- and
post-processing - that can be used with DWaveSampler to handle minor-embedding,
optimize chain strength, etc.
