ecCodes is a package developed by ECMWF which provides an application
programming interface and a set of tools for decoding and encoding messages in
the following formats:
- WMO FM-92 GRIB edition 1 and edition 2
- WMO FM-94 BUFR edition 3 and edition 4
- WMO GTS abbreviated header (only decoding).

A useful set of command line tools provide quick access to the messages. C,
Fortran 90 and Python interfaces provide access to the main ecCodes
functionality.

ecCodes is an evolution of GRIB-API. It is designed to provide the user with a
simple set of functions to access data from several formats with a key/value
approach.

For GRIB encoding and decoding, the GRIB-API functionality is provided fully in
ecCodes with only minor interface and behaviour changes. Interfaces for C,
Fortran 90 and Python are all maintained as in GRIB-API. However, the GRIB-API
Fortran 77 interface is no longer available.
