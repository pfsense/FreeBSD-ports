Silo is a library for reading and writing a wide variety of scientific
data to binary, disk files. The files Silo produces and the data within
them can be easily shared and exchanged between wholly independently
developed applications running on disparate computing platforms.
Consequently, Silo facilitates the development of general purpose tools
for processing scientific data.
