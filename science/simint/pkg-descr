Simint is a vectorized implementation of the Obara-Saika (OS) method of
calculating electron repulsion integrals. Speedup is gained by vectorizing
the primitive loop of the OS algorithm, with additional vectorization and
optimizations left to the compiler.

Simint is intended to be used for quantum chemistry computations.
