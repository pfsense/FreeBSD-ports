Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able to
handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme, models
where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme, models where
agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the state of the
economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning process. In terms
of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate consumers,
productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and financial
intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by including
several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned agent
categories.
