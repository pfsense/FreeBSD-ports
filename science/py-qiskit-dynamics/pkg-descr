Qiskit Dynamics is an open-source project for building, transforming, and
solving time-dependent quantum systems in Qiskit.

The goal of Qiskit Dynamics is to provide access to different numerical methods
for solving differential equations, and to automate common processes typically
performed by hand, e.g. applying frame transformations or rotating wave
approximations to system and control Hamiltonians.
