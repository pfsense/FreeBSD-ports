Qiskit is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the
level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and primitives.

This library is the core component of Qiskit, which contains the building
blocks for creating and working with quantum circuits, quantum operators,
and primitive functions (Sampler and Estimator). It also contains a
transpiler that supports optimizing quantum circuits, and a quantum
information toolbox for creating advanced operators.
