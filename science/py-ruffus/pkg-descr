The Ruffus module is a lightweight way to add support for running computational
pipelines.

Computational pipelines are often conceptually quite simple, especially if we
breakdown the process into simple stages, or separate tasks.

Each stage or task in a computational pipeline is represented by a Python
function. Each Python function can be called in parallel to run multiple jobs.

Ruffus was originally designed for use in bioinformatics to analyse multiple
genome data sets.
