VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) is a molecular visualization program for
displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems. It
utilizes 3D graphics and built-in scripting (Tcl and Python) for
interactive exploration.

Key features include:
- Visualization of molecular dynamics simulations.
- Support for over 60 molecular file formats and data types.
- Various rendering styles (licorice, ribbons, van der Waals spheres).
- High-quality rendering, animation, and stereo display.
- Integrated analysis tools and custom scripting for advanced analysis.
- GPU acceleration and no inherent limits on molecular size.
- Cross-platform availability (Windows, macOS, and Linux).
