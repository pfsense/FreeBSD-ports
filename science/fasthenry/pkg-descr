FastHenry computes the frequency dependent self and mutual inductances and
resistances between conductors of complex shape. The algorithm used in
FastHenry is an acceleration of rge mesh formulation approach. The linear system
resulting from the mesh formulation is solved using a generalized minimal
residual algorithm with a fast multipole algorithm to efficiently compute the
iterates.

--------------------- Superconductivity Support -------------------------

This version of fasthenry has been modified to support superconducting
segments and ground planes by Stephen R. Whiteley of Whitleley Research Inc.
The analysis used is based on the London equations and the two-fluid
model.  Both reactive and lossy components of the superconductor complex
conductivity are employed in obtaining the impedance matrix.
