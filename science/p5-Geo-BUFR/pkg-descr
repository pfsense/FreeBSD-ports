BUFR = Binary Universal Form for the Representation of meteorological data.
BUFR is approved by WMO (World Meteorological Organization) as the standard
universal exchange format for meteorological observations, gradually
replacing a lot of older alphanumeric data formats.

This module provides methods for decoding and encoding BUFR messages, and
for displaying information in BUFR B and D tables and in BUFR flag and code
tables.

Installing this module also installs some programs: bufrread.pl,
bufrresolve.pl, bufrencode.pl, bufr_reencode.pl and bufralter.pl. See
https://wiki.met.no/bufr.pm/start for examples of use. For the majority of
potential users of Geo::BUFR I would expect these programs to be all that
you will need Geo::BUFR for.
