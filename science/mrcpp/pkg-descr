The MultiResolution Computation Program Package (MRCPP) is a general purpose
numerical mathematics library based on multiresolution analysis and the
multiwavelet basis which provide low-scaling algorithms as well as rigorous
error control in numerical computations.

The code is being developed at the Hylleraas Centre for Quantum Molecular
Sciences at UiT - The Arctic University of Norway.
