py-corner is a Python library designed to create "corner plots" (also known as
triangle plots or scatterplot matrices) for visualizing high-dimensional data.

These plots are particularly useful in scientific fields such as astrophysics,
cosmology, and statistics for displaying the marginalized distributions of
parameters from a multi-dimensional sample (e.g., from Markov Chain Monte Carlo
simulations).

The library generates 1D histograms for individual parameters and 2D histograms
(or scatter plots) for all pairs of parameters, providing a comprehensive
overview of their distributions and correlations.
