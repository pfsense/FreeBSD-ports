HighFive is a modern C++/C++11 friendly interface for libhdf5.

HighFive supports STL vector/string, Boost::UBLAS and Boost::Multi-array. It
handles C++ from/to HDF5 automatic type mapping. HighFive does not require an
additional library and supports both HDF5 thread safety and Parallel HDF5
(contrary to the official hdf5 cpp).
