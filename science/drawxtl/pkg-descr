DRAWxtl is a program to display crystal structures on ordinary computer hardware
and operating systems. Four forms of graphics are produced:
(1) an openGL window for immediate viewing,
(2) the Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer (POV-RAY) scene language for
    publication-quality drawings, (3) the Virtual Reality Modeling Language
    (VRML) for dissemination across the Internet, and
(4) a Postscript rendering of the OpenGL window for those that want high-quality
    output but do not have POV-RAY installed.
