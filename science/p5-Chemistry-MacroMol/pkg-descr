Chemistry-MacroMol is a toolkit includes basic objects and methods to
describe macromolecules, a macromolecule is just a molecule that
consists of several "domains". For example, a protein consists
of aminoacid residues, or a nucleic acid consists of bases. Therefore
Chemistry::MacroMol is derived from Chemistry::Mol, with additional
methods to handle the domains.
