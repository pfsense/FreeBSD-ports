This package provides read +/- write access to some common medical and
neuroimaging file formats, including: ANALYZE (plain, SPM99, SPM2 and later),
GIFTI, NIfTI1, NIfTI2, CIFTI-2, MINC1, MINC2, AFNI BRIK/HEAD, MGH and ECAT as
well as Philips PAR/REC. We can read and write FreeSurfer geometry, annotation
and morphometry files. There is some very limited support for DICOM. NiBabel is
the successor of PyNIfTI.

The various image format classes give full or selective access to header (meta)
information and access to the image data is made available via NumPy arrays.
