The HepMC package is an object oriented, C++ event record for High Energy
Physics Monte Carlo generators and simulation. The original code was written
by M. Dobbs and J.B. Hansen (Comput. Phys. Commun. 134 (2001) 41). Since the
first implementation, the package has undergone several modifications and in
particular, the latest HepMC3 series is a completely new rewrite using
currently available C++11 techniques.
