OpenSPH is an integrator of hydrodynamic equations using SPH discretization in
space, currently specialized on simulations of asteroid impacts. The code is
being developed on Astronomical Institute of Charles University in Prague. It
aims to provide a fast, versatile and easily extensible SPH solver utilizing
modern CPU features (SSE/AVX instruction sets).
