RGeo is a geospatial data library for Ruby.

RGeo is a key component for writing location-aware applications in the Ruby
programming language. At its core is an implementation of the industry standard
OGC Simple Features Specification, which provides data representations of
geometric objects such as points, lines, and polygons, along with a set of
geometric analysis operations. This makes it ideal for modeling geolocation
data. It also supports a suite of optional add-on modules that provide various
geolocation-related services.

Use the core rgeo gem to:
- Represent spatial and geolocation data objects such as points, lines, and
  polygons in your Ruby application.
- Perform standard spatial analysis operations such as finding intersections,
  creating buffers, and computing lengths and areas.
- Correctly handle spherical geometry, and compute geographic projections for
  map display and data analysis.
- Read and write location data in the WKT and WKB representations used by
  spatial databases.
