GeoMet converts GeoJSON to WKT/WKB (Well-Known Text/Binary), and vice versa.
Extended WKB/WKT are also supported. Conversion functions are exposed through
idiomatic load/loads/dump/dumps interfaces.

GeoMet is intended to cover all common use cases for dealing with 2D, 3D, and 4D
geometries (including 'Z', 'M', and 'ZM').
