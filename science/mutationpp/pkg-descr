Mutation++ is an open-source library originally developed at the von Karman
Institute for Fluid Dynamics, designed to couple with conventional computational
fluid dynamics codes to provide thermodynamic, transport, chemistry, and energy
transfer properties associated with subsonic to hypersonic flows.
