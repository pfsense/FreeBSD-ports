Nilearn enables approachable and versatile analyses of brain volumes. It
provides statistical and machine-learning tools, with instructive documentation
& open community.

It supports general linear model (GLM) based analysis and leverages the
scikit-learn Python toolbox for multivariate statistics with applications such
as predictive modelling, classification, decoding, or connectivity analysis.

Nilearn now includes the functionality of Nistats. Here's a guide to replacing
Nistats imports to work in Nilearn.
