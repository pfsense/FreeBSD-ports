Multiwfn is an extremely powerful program for realizing electronic wavefunction
analysis, which is a key ingredient of quantum chemistry. Multiwfn is free,
open-source, high-efficient, very user-friendly and flexible, it supports almost
all of the most important wavefunction analysis methods. 64 bit Windows, Linux
and Mac OS platforms are supported.
