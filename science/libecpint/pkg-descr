Libecpint is a C++ library for the efficient evaluation of integrals over
ab initio effective core potentials, using a mixture of generated, recursive
code and Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature. It is designed to be standalone and
generic, and is now in its first stable release. If you experience any problems
please raise an issue here; contributions and suggestions are also welcome.
