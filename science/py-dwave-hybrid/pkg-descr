dwave-hybrid is a general, minimal Python framework for building hybrid
asynchronous decomposition samplers for quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) problems.

dwave-hybrid facilitates three aspects of solution development:
* Hybrid approaches to combining quantum and classical compute resources
* Evaluating a portfolio of algorithmic components and problem-decomposition
  strategies
* Experimenting with workflow structures and parameters to obtain the best
  application results
