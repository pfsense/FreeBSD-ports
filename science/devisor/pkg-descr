DeViSoR is abbreviated for "Design and Visualization of Software Resource". The
DeViSoRGrid application is part of that software family and is primarily used
for the following tasks, so far in 2D only:

  * Geometry generation
  * Manual coarse mesh generation
  * Grid visualisation at all levels

All of this can be done in a very confortable manner using a simple point and
click interface like in common vector-based image processing software. Both the
reliable FEAT file format and the new FEAST format with integrated parallelism
are supported.
