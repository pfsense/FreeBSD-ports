Orthanc-dicomweb extends the native REST API of Orthanc with a reference
implementation of the DICOMweb standard. Loading the plugin into Orthanc will
provide support of WADO-URI (previously known simply as WADO), WADO-RS,
QIDO-RS and STOW-RS.

Out-of-the-box, Orthanc comes with its own REST API. This API allows full
CRUD operations (create, read, update and delete) on the set of DICOM
resources that Orthanc stores, together with commands that trigger calls to
the DICOM protocol (C-Echo SCU/SCP, C-Store SCU/SCP, C-Find SCU/SCP, C-Move
SCU/SCP).
