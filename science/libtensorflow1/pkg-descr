TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a
comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources
that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily
build and deploy ML-powered applications. The TensorFlow C API is typically a
requirement of TensorFlow APIs in other languages such as Go and Rust.

This is version 1 of the API, which is deprecated but still widely used.
