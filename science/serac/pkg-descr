Serac is a 3D implicit nonlinear thermal-structural simulation code. Its primary
purpose is to investigate multiphysics abstraction strategies and implicit
finite element-based algorithm development for emerging computing architectures.
It also serves as a proxy-app for LLNL's Smith code and heavily leverages the
MFEM finite element library.
