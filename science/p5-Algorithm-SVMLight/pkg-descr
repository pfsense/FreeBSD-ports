This module implements a perl interface to Thorsten Joachims' SVMLight
package:

    SVMLight is an implementation of Vapnik's Support Vector Machine
    [Vapnik, 1995] for the problem of pattern recognition, for the
    problem of regression, and for the problem of learning a ranking
    function. The optimization algorithms used in SVMlight are
    described in [Joachims, 2002a ]. [Joachims, 1999a]. The algorithm
    has scalable memory requirements and can handle problems with many
    thousands of support vectors efficiently.
