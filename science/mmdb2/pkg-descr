MMDB is designed to assist developers in working with macromolecular coordinate
files. The library handles both PDB and mmCIF format files.

The Library also features an internal binary format, portable between different
platforms. This is achieved at uniformity of the Library's interface functions,
so that there is no difference in handling different formats.

MMDB provides various high-level tools for working with coordinate files,
including reading and writing, orthogonal-fractional transforms, generation of
symmetry mates, editing the molecular structure and more.

MMDB is written by Eugene Krissinel, and is distributed as a part of the CCP4
suite. This project maintains a current stand-alone version of the library.
