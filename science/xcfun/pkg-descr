XCFun is a library of exchange-correlation (XC) functionals to be used in
density-functional theory (DFT) codes. XCFun follows a unique implementation
strategy which enables the computation of derivatives of the XC functional
kernel up to arbitrary order. It does so by relying on forward-mode automatic
differentiation.
