There are several formats used to present geographic coordinates.

Geo::Coordinates::Transform converts a list of provided latitude and longitude
coordinates in any of the three formats above (mixed input is ok) and converts
to the desired format. Note that special characters or non-numerical characters
such as " will throw an warning and return NaN for that list item.

In addition, the input does not interpert N,S,W,E designators but expects
coordinates to be in positive or negative representation.

Format of the output can be controlled via input arguments in the constructor.
The arguments are expected to be in the form of a hash reference.
