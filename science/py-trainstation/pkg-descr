trainstation is a tool that allows the efficient construction of
linear models. It provides supplementary functionality for handling
data and model metrics and relies on the scikit-learn library for the
actual training. trainstation has been originally developed to aid the
construction of force constant and cluster expansions. Since it has
proven to be valuable in more general contexts and to simplify the
maintenance of the two aforementioned packages, the functionality has
been moved into a separate package.
