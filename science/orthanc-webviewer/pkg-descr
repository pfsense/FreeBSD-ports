Orthanc can be extended by a plugin that brings a Web viewer of medical
images. The Web viewer is based upon the two following projects:

Cornerstone (https://github.com/chafey/cornerstone), a client-side JavaScript
library to display medical images in Web browsers, by Chris Hafey, and

GDCM (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcm/), an open-source implementation
of the DICOM standard with advanced features for image decoding, by Mathieu
Malaterre.
