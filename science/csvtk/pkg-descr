CSV/TSV formats are basic and ubiquitous file formats in both Bioinformatics
and data science.

People usually use spreadsheet software like MS Excel to process table data.
However this is all by clicking and typing, which is not automated and is
time-consuming to repeat, especially when you want to apply similar operations
with different datasets or purposes.

csvtk is convenient for rapid data investigation and also easy to integrate
into analysis pipelines. It could save you lots of time in (not) writing
Python/R scripts.
