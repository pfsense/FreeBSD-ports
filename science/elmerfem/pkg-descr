Elmer runs multiphysical simulations, using the finite element method
to solve predefined or user-specified partial differential equations.
There are models for structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, acoustics,
heat transfer, and electromagnetism in both two and three dimensions.
New solvers can be added as separate modules linked into the program.

While Elmer is powerful, it is not for the faint of heart. New users
can expect to spend days or weeks honing their skills in one domain.

This port is a development version of Elmer, which may or may not be
better suited to your needs than the latest official release.
