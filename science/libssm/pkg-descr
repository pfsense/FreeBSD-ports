SSM is a macromolecular coordinate superposition library, written by Eugene
Krissinel of the EBI.

The library implements the SSM algorithm of protein structure comparison in
three dimensions, which includes an original procedure of matching graphs built
on the protein's secondary-structure elements, followed by an iterative
three-dimensional alignment of protein backbone Calpha atoms.
