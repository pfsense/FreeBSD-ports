This package contains a specification, library, and utilities for describing
HDF5 content in JSON. The utilities can be used to convert any HDF5 file to
JSON or from a JSON file (using the convention described here to HDF5).

The library is useful for any Python application that needs to translate between
HDF5 objects and JSON serializations. In addition to the utilities provided in
this repository, the library is used by HDF Server (a RESTful web service for
HDF5), and HDF Product Designer (an application for creating product designs).
