ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python framework for
processing seismological data. It provides parsers for common file formats,
clients to access data centers and seismological signal processing routines
which allow the manipulation of seismological time series (see Beyreuther
et al. 2010, Megies et al. 2011).

The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate rapid application development
for seismology.
