MRChem is a numerical real-space code for molecular electronic structure
calculations within the self-consistent field (SCF) approximations of quantum
chemistry (Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory).

The code is being developed at the Hylleraas Centre for Quantum Molecular
Sciences at UiT - The Arctic University of Norway.
