Qiskit [quiss-kit] is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers
at the level of pulses, circuits, and application modules.

Qiskit Optimization is one of Qiskit components. It covers the whole range from
high-level modeling of optimization problems, with automatic conversion of
problems to different required representations, to a suite of easy-to-use
quantum optimization algorithms that are ready to run on classical simulators,
as well as on real quantum devices via Qiskit.
