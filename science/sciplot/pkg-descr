The goal of the sciplot project is to enable C++ programs to conveniently plot
beautiful graphs as easy as in other high-level programming languages. sciplot
is a header-only library that needs a C++17-capable compiler, but has no
external dependencies for compiling. The only external runtime dependencies are
gnuplot-palettes for providing color palettes and a gnuplot executable.
