CCP4 exists to produce and support a world-leading, integrated suite of programs
that allows researchers to determine macromolecular structures by X-ray
crystallography, and other biophysical techniques. CCP4 aims to develop and
support the development of cutting edge approaches to experimental determination
and analysis of protein structure, and integrate these approaches into the
suite. CCP4 is a community based resource that supports the widest possible
researcher community, embracing academic, not for profit, and for profit
research. CCP4 aims to play a key role in the education and training of
scientists in experimental structural biology. It encourages the wide
dissemination of new ideas, techniques and practice.
