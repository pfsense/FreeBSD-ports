SIMLIB/C++ is the SIMulation LIBrary for C++ programming language. You can
create models directly in C++ language with the use of predefined simulation
tools from the library. SIMLIB allows object-oriented description of models
based on simulation abstractions. Current version allows a description of
continuous, discrete, combined, 2D/3D vector, and fuzzy models.

SIMLIB/C++ is developed at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering,
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Brno University of
Technology since 1991.
