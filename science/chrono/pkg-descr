Project Chrono represents a community effort aimed at producing a physics-based
modelling and simulation infrastructure based on a platform-independent,
open-source design. The name of this software infrastructure is Chrono. Some of
its features are listed below. More information is available at the project
website. The applications areas in which Chrono is most often used are vehicle
dynamics, robotics, and machine design. In vehicle dynamics, Chrono has mature
support for tire/terrain interaction modeling and simulation.
