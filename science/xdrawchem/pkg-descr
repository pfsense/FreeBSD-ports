XDrawChem is a program for drawing chemical structures in two
dimensions. It comes with a library of amino acids and nucleic
acids. It can read and write MDL Molfiles, read and write CML
(Chemical Markup Language), read (some?) ChemDraw XML and binary
files, and export to EPS. It can predict 13C NMR and simple IR
spectra. It works under Unix or Windows.
