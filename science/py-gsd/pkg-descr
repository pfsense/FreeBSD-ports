A library to read and write GSD (General Simulation Data) file format.

The package also contains a python module that reads and writes hoomd
schema gsd files with an easy to use syntax.

Features:
* Efficiently store many frames of data from simulation runs.
* High performance file read and write.
* Support arbitrary chunks of data in each frame (position, orientation,
  type, etc...).
* Append frames to an existing file with a monotonically increasing frame
  number.
* Resilient to job kills.
* Variable number of named chunks in each frame.
* Variable size of chunks in each frame.
* Each chunk identifies data type.
* Common use cases: NxM arrays in double, float, int, char types.
* Generic use case: binary blob of N bytes.
* Easy to integrate into other tools with python, or a C API (< 1k lines).
* Fast random access to frames.
