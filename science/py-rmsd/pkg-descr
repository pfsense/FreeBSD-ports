Calculate Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of Two Molecules Using Rotation.

The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is calculated, using Kabsch
algorithm (1976) or Quaternion algorithm (1991) for rotation, between two
Cartesian coordinates in either .xyz or .pdb format, resulting in the minimal
RMSD.
