Gemmi is a library, accompanied by a set of programs, developed primarily for
use in macromolecular crystallography (MX). For working with:
* macromolecular models (content of PDB, PDBx/mmCIF and mmJSON files),
* refinement restraints (CIF files),
* reflection data (MTZ and mmCIF formats),
* data on a 3D grid (electron density maps, masks, MRC/CCP4 format)
* crystallographic symmetry.
