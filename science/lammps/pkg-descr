LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code with a focus on materials
modeling. It's an acronym for Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel
Simulator.

LAMMPS has potentials for solid-state materials (metals, semiconductors) and
soft matter (biomolecules, polymers) and coarse-grained or mesoscopic systems.
It can be used to model atoms or, more generically, as a parallel particle
simulator at the atomic, meso, or continuum scale.

LAMMPS runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing techniques
and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation domain. Many of its models have
versions that provide accelerated performance on CPUs, GPUs, and Intel Xeon
Phis. The code is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new
functionality.
