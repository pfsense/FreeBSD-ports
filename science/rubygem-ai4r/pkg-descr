AI4R is a collection of ruby algorithms implementations, covering several
Artificial intelligence fields. It implements:
* Genetic algorithms
* Self-organized maps (SOM)
* Neural Networks
  - Multilayer perceptron with Backpropagation learning
  - Hopfield net
* Automatic classifiers (Machine Learning)
  - ID3 (Decision Trees)
  - PRISM (J. Cendrowska, 1987)
  - Multilayer Perceptron
  - OneR (AKA One Attribute Rule, 1R)
  - ZeroR
  - Hyperpipes
  - Naive Bayes
  - IB1 (D. Aha, D. Kibler - 1991)
* Data clustering
  - K-means, Bisecting K-means
  - Single linkage, Complete linkage, Average linkage, Weighted Average linkage,
    Centroid linkage, Median linkage, Ward's method linkage
  - Diana (Divisive Analysis)
