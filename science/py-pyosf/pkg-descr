pyosf is a pure Python library for simple file sync with Open Science Framework.

This package is for simple synchronisation of files from the local file space to
the Open Science Framework (OSF). There is a more complex fully-featured sync
package by the Center for Open Science, who created OSF, called "osf-sync".
