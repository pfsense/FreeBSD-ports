The open source ALPSCore project, which is based on ALPS (Algorithms and
Libraries for Physics Simulations) project, provides a collection of physics
libraries and applications, with a focus on simulations of lattice models and
strongly correlated systems. This project strives to provide a convenient set of
maintained, well-documented, and reusable components for developing condensed
matter physics simulation code, to help application developers make commonly
used and proven computational algorithms available to a non-expert community.
