MADNESS provides a high-level environment for the solution of integral and
differential equations in many dimensions using adaptive, fast methods with
guaranteed precision based on multi-resolution analysis and novel separated
representations. There are three main components to MADNESS. At the lowest
level is a new petascale parallel programming environment that increases
programmer productivity and code performance/scalability while maintaining
backward compatibility with current programming tools such as MPI and Global
Arrays. The numerical capabilities built upon the parallel tools provide a
high-level environment for composing and solving numerical problems in many
(1-6+) dimensions. Finally, built upon the numerical tools are new applications
with initial focus upon chemistry, atomic and molecular physics, material
science, and nuclear structure.
