Segyio is a small LGPL licensed C library for easy interaction with SEG-Y and
Seismic Unix formatted seismic data, with language bindings for Python and
Matlab. Segyio is an attempt to create an easy-to-use, embeddable,
community-oriented library for seismic applications. Features are added as they
are needed; suggestions and contributions of all kinds are very welcome.
