MP2D is an open-source code (MIT license, see below) for calculating
van der Waals dispersion for second-order Moller-Plesset pertubation
theory. The calculation of the MP2D dispersion correction is analogous
to MP2C:
    E_MP2D = E_MP2 - E_UCHF + E_CKS

The UCHF and CKS dispersion energies are calculated according to Grimme's D3
method. The CKS coefficients identical to those used in D3. The UCHF
coefficients were calculated specifically for this work. Dispersion
coefficients are currently available for the following elements:
    H, B, C, N, O, F, Ne, P, S, Cl, Ar, Br
