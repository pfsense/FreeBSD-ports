AbiPy is a Python library to analyze the results produced by ABINIT, an
open-source program for the ab-initio calculations of the physical properties
of materials within Density Functional Theory and Many-Body perturbation theory.
AbiPy also provides tools to generate input files and workflows to automate
ab-initio calculations and typical convergence studies. AbiPy is interfaced with
Pymatgen allowing users to benefit from the different tools and python objects
available in the pymatgen ecosystem.
