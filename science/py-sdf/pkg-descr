Generate 3D meshes based on SDFs (signed distance functions) with a dirt simple
Python API.

sdf natively writes binary STL files. For other formats, meshio is used (based
on your output file extension). This adds support for over 20 different 3D file
formats, including OBJ, PLY, VTK, and many more.

You could use cad/meshlab or cad/gmsh to view the mesh.

Remark: there exists also another Python program named SDF (in uppercase),
Scientific Data Format, but this is a different one: see
<https://pypi.org/project/SDF/>.
