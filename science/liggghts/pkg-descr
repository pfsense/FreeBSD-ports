LIGGGHTS stands for LAMMPS improved for general granular and granular heat
transfer simulations.

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulator. It is widely used in the
field of Molecular Dynamics. Thanks to physical and algorithmic analogies,
LAMMPS is a very good platform for DEM simulations. LAMMPS offers a GRANULAR
package to perform these kind of simulations. LIGGGHTS aims to improve those
capability with the goal to apply it to industrial applications.

The features added in LIGGGHTS with respect to the original LAMMPS distribution
comprise:
* Import and handling of complex wall geometries from CAD
* A moving mesh feature to account for moving geometry
* Re-write of contact force formulation, including optional cohesional and
  rolling friction forces
* Heat conduction between particles in contact
* Improved particle insertion based on surface and volume meshes
* A "template" mechanism to account for particle non-uniformity
* More features added in the meantime and upcoming, see here.
