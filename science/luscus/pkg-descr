Luscus is the program for graphical display and editing of molecular systems.
The program allows fast and easy building and/or editing different molecular
structures, up to several thousands of atoms large. Luscus can also visualize
dipole moments, normal modes, molecular orbitals, electron densities and
electrostatic potentials. In addition, simple geometrical objects can be
rendered in order to point out a geometrical feature or a physical quantity.
The program is developed as a graphical interface for MOLCAS program package,
however it's adaptive nature makes possible using luscus with other
computational program packages and chemical formats.
