Neo is a package for representing electrophysiology data in Python, together
with support for reading a wide range of neurophysiology file formats.

The goal of Neo is to improve interoperability between Python tools for
analyzing, visualizing and generating electrophysiology data, by providing
a common, shared object model. In order to be as lightweight a dependency
as possible, Neo is deliberately limited to representation of data, with
no functions for data analysis or visualization.
