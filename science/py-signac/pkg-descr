The signac framework helps users manage and scale file-based workflows,
facilitating data reuse, sharing, and reproducibility.

It provides a simple and robust data model to create a well-defined indexable
storage layout for data and metadata. This makes it easier to operate on large
data spaces, streamlines post-processing and analysis and makes data
collectively accessible.
