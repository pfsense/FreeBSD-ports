The aim of the project is to produce a set of object-oriented libraries for the
organisation of crystallographic data and the performance of crystallographic
computation. The libraries are designed as a framework for new crystallographic
software, which will allow the full power of modern programming techniques to be
exploited by the developer. This will lead to greater functionality from simpler
code which will be easier to develop and debug.
