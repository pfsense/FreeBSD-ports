ChemPy is a Python package useful for chemistry (mainly
physical/inorganic/analytical chemistry). Currently it includes:
* Numerical integration routines for chemical kinetics (ODE solver front-end)
* Integrated rate expressions (and convenience fitting routines)
* Solver for equilibria (including multiphase systems)
* Relations in physical chemistry:
  * Debye-Huckel expressions
  * Arrhenius & Eyring equation
  * Einstein-Smoluchowski equation
* Properties (pure python implementations from the literature)
  * water density as function of temperature
  * water permittivity as function of temperature and pressure
  * water diffusivity as function of temperature
  * water viscosity as function of temperature
  * sulfuric acid density as function of temperature & weight fraction H2SO4
