Medit is an interactive mesh visualization software, developed by P. Frey
(University Pierre et Marie Curie).

It is intended to display computation results (in mechanics of the solids or
fluids, thermics, electromagnetism, etc.) on grids 2d (triangles and
quadrangles), 3d (tetrahedrons or hexahedrons) or surfaces (triangles and
quandrangles).
