MCPL is a binary file format for usage in physics simulations.

MCPL files contain lists of particle state information, and allows for easy
storage and interchange of particles between various Monte Carlo simulation
applications. It is implemented in portable C code and is made available to
the scientific community, along with converters and plugins for several popular
simulation packages.
