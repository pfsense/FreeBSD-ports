You installed GAMESS (US): General Atomic and Molecular Electronic
                           Structure System

In order to run the computation, run the command:
$ rungms {case-name} %%GAMES_VERNO%% {num-cpu}
or its simplified form:
$ rungms {case-name}

It expects the input file {case-name}.inp which specifies the
computation to perform.

You can use the wxmacmolplt command from science/wxmacmolplt to view
the computation results.
